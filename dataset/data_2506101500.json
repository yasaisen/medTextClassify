        "abstract": "In this study, depressive symptomatology in Central American immigrant mothers with adolescent daughters living in the USA was explored. Using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Short Scale, the Family History Scale, an Acculturation Scale, and the core section of the Youth Conduct Disorder scale from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 101 Central American mothers were analyzed to identify predictors of depressive symptoms. Over one-third of the participants had depressive symptoms. There were no significant findings for acculturation as a predictor of depressive symptoms. Predictors that related to depressive symptomatology were a positive family history of depression, marital status (divorced), and having a daughter engaged in health risk behaviors. Clinicians working with mothers from Central America should consider risk of depression, whether there is a family history of depression; and additional stresses, such as the health risk behaviors of adolescents. Unprecedented levels of immigration around the world underscore the importance of meeting the healthcare needs of culturally-diverse groups.",

        "abstract": "AIMS: The primary aim was to investigate variables affecting compliance in pregnant women recommended for genetic consultation for abnormal screening test results, family predisposition or medical history. Our main focus was on a women's knowledge of particular screening tests, their initial feelings and changes in these feeling with time, as well as variables relevant to further decision making.\nMETHODS: We used an anonymous questionnaire based on previous qualitative research. The questions were formulated by a medical geneticist, and the questionnaires were distributed prior to prenatal screening tests performed by doctors or trained nurses. The research cohort consisted of 271 women aged 16-42 years. Six hypotheses were tested using the statistical programme STATISTICA; significance levels were set to P<0.05.\nRESULTS: The questionnaire results showed insufficient knowledge. The women were confused about invasive, screening and ultrasound tests. Genetic test recommendation was largely associated with stress in these patients. Between recommendation and consultation, the women mostly looked for support from their partners. There was a surprisingly low percentage of women who looked for help from their medical specialists and a surprisingly high percentage of those who did not seek any help at all.\nCONCLUSION: Women's distress can be reduced if the information about recommended genetic consultation is conveyed correctly and this can also help them make the right informed decision about their future course of action.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Hemophilia involves a lifelong burden from the perspective of the patient and the entire healthcare system. Advances in genetic testing provide valuable information to hemophilia-affected families for family planning. The aim of this study was to analyze the cost-effectiveness of carrier and prenatal genetic testing in the health-economic framework in Taiwan.\nMETHODS: A questionnaire was developed to assess the attitudes towards genetic testing for hemophilia. We modeled clinical outcomes of the proposed testing scheme by using the decision tree method. Incremental cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted, based on data from the National Health Insurance (NHI) database and a questionnaire survey.\nRESULTS: From the NHI database, 1111 hemophilic patients were identified and required an average medical expenditure of approximately New Taiwan (NT) $2.1 million per patient-year in 2009. By using the decision tree model, we estimated that 26 potential carriers need to be tested to prevent one case of hemophilia. At a screening rate of 79%, carrier and prenatal genetic testing would cost NT $85.9 million, which would be offset by an incremental saving of NT $203 million per year by preventing 96 cases of hemophilia. Assuming that the life expectancy for hemophilic patients is 70 years, genetic testing could further save NT $14.2 billion. Higher screening rates would increase the savings for healthcare resources.\nCONCLUSION: Carrier and prenatal genetic testing for hemophilia is a cost-effective investment in healthcare allocation. A case management system should be integrated in the current practice to facilitate patient care (e.g., collecting family pedigrees and providing genetic counseling).",

        "title": "Familial Hypercholesterolemia",
        "abstract": "CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is characterized by significantly elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) that leads to atherosclerotic plaque deposition in the coronary arteries and proximal aorta at an early age and increases the risk of premature cardiovascular events such as angina and myocardial infarction; stroke occurs more rarely. Xanthomas (cholesterol deposits in tendons) may be visible in the Achilles tendons or tendons of the hands and worsen with age as a result of extremely high cholesterol levels. Xanthelasmas (yellowish, waxy deposits) can occur around the eyelids. Individuals with FH may develop corneal arcus (white, gray, or blue opaque ring in the corneal margin as a result of cholesterol deposition) at a younger age than those without FH. Individuals with a more severe phenotype, often as a result of biallelic variants, can present with very significant elevations in LDL-C (>500 mg/dL), early-onset coronary artery disease (CAD; presenting as early as childhood in some), and calcific aortic valve disease.\nDIAGNOSIS/TESTING: A clinical diagnosis of FH can be established in a proband with characteristic clinical features and significantly elevated LDL-C levels (typically &gt;190 mg/dL in adults and &gt;160 mg/dL in children). Three formal diagnostic criteria are used in Western countries. The molecular diagnosis of FH can be established by identification of heterozygous or biallelic pathogenic variants in APOB (variants that impair binding of LDL-C to the LDL receptor), LDLR, or PCSK9 (gain of function); or rarely, identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in LDLRAP1.\nMANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Adults: pharmacotherapy (statins with additional medications as needed) to reduce lipid levels; referral to a lipid specialist if necessary to reduce LDL-C levels; reduce CAD risk factors including cessation of smoking, regular physical activity, healthy diet, and weight control; treatment of hypertension; low-dose aspirin in high-risk individuals. Children: referral to a lipid specialist; diet and lifestyle modifications; statins can be used in children starting around age eight years. Prevention of primary manifestations: Heart-healthy diet (including reduced intake of saturated fat and increased intake of soluble fiber to 10-20 g/day); increased physical activity; no smoking. Surveillance: Monitor lipid levels from age two years; consider noninvasive imaging modalities in adults; identify modifiable risk factors (e.g., smoking, sedentary behavior, hypertension, diabetes, obesity). Individuals with severe FH (i.e., due to homozygous or compound heterozygous pathogenic variants in APOB, LDLR, or PCSK9) or autosomal recessive FH (due to homozygous or compound heterozygous pathogenic variants in LDLRAP1) should be monitored with various imaging modalities (including echocardiogram, CT angiogram, and cardiac catheterization) as recommended. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Smoking, high intake of saturated and trans unsaturated fat, sedentary lifestyle, obesity, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Early diagnosis and treatment of first-degree and second-degree relatives at risk for FH can reduce morbidity and mortality. The genetic status of at-risk family members can be clarified by either: (1) molecular genetic testing if the pathogenic variant(s) has been identified in an affected family member; or (2) measurement of LDL-C concentration. Genetic testing is the preferred method for clarifying the diagnosis in at-risk family members, when possible. Pregnancy management: Pregnant women should incorporate all the recommended lifestyle changes, including low saturated fat intake, no smoking, and high dietary soluble fiber. Statins are contraindicated in pregnancy because of concerns for teratogenicity and should be discontinued prior to conception. Bile acid-binding resins (e.g., colesevelam) are generally considered safe (Class B for pregnancy), and LDL apheresis is also used occasionally if there is evidence of established CAD. Use of PCSK9 inhibitors, ezetimibe, lomitapide, and bempedoic acid during pregnancy has not been well studied.\nGENETIC COUNSELING: APOB-, LDLR-, and PCSK9-related FH are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. If an individual has biallelic (homozygous or compound heterozygous) pathogenic variants in one of these three genes \u2013 a condition referred to as homozygous FH (HoFH) \u2013 the presentation becomes more severe with earlier onset of features. Some individuals with FH are heterozygous for pathogenic variants in two different FH-related genes, which may have an additive effect on the severity of FH. Each child of an individual with a heterozygous pathogenic variant in APOB, LDLR, or PCSK9 has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant and having FH. All children of an individual with homozygous FH will inherit a pathogenic variant and have FH. If the reproductive partner of a proband is heterozygous for an FH-related pathogenic variant in the same gene as the proband or a different FH-related gene, offspring are at risk of inheriting two pathogenic variants and having severe FH. LDLRAP1-related FH is caused by biallelic pathogenic variants and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. The parents of an individual with LDLRAP1-related FH are presumed to be heterozygous for one pathogenic variant. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for an LDLRAP1 pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being a carrier, and a 25% chance of inheriting neither of the familial pathogenic variants. Carrier testing for at-risk relatives requires prior identification of the LDLRAP1 pathogenic variants in the family. Once the FH-causing pathogenic variant(s) have been identified in an affected family member, prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

        "abstract": "As our understanding of genetics has increased, so has the number of genetic tests that have entered clinical practice. Given the need of many European health care systems to contain costs, the question of how to prioritise genetic tests fairly has become an emerging concern. This study uses a discrete-choice experiment to assess the value judgements of clinical geneticists, patient representatives and other stakeholders regarding the prioritisation of genetic tests. The respondents chose between two hypothetical scenarios that differed in severity of the disease, risk of the disease, aim of the test, medical benefit of the test, and costs of the test. Standard logit models and mixed effects models were used to estimate the weights different stakeholders attached to attribute levels. Responses from 594 participants were analysed. The most highly valued attribute levels were a proven medical benefit of the test, high risk of having the disease and low costs of the test. Results also showed that rankings differ between clinical geneticists and other stakeholders. The priority weights determined within this study can inform the policy debate and improve the consistency of prioritisation in genetics. Further stakeholder deliberation is needed to explore their most appropriate use in decision practice.",

        "abstract": "AIM: Within schizophrenia, genetic factors contribute greatly to risk, yet genetic testing for the disorder is not available. For some individuals with specific genotypes, cannabis use may increase risk of schizophrenia. It is possible that genetic tests could be offered in the future to inform individuals of the risk of schizophrenia if they use cannabis. Previous research, however, provides little guidance on how young adults might respond to such tests.\nMETHODS: We assessed a group of young adults (n\u2009=\u200983) to determine how the perceived magnitude of increased risk for schizophrenia in the presence of cannabis use influences decisions to undergo genetic testing, as well as subsequent attitudes and intentions towards cannabis use.\nRESULTS: Participants were significantly more likely to indicate willingness to get tested if the results identified a 10% risk versus a 2% risk of schizophrenia. Participants also indicated that if the results of their test reflected increased risk due to cannabis use, it would be more important to avoid cannabis in the 10% risk scenario as compared to the 2% risk scenario. These findings remained consistent among a subset of participants who indicated cannabis use.\nCONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that cannabis users and non-users were positively influenced in terms of intentions to change behaviour based on the magnitude of risk conveyed by genetic testing. These findings provide an initial step towards understanding young people's attitudes towards genetic testing and may help prepare interventions specifically tailored around cannabis use reduction for people at risk for schizophrenia.",

        "abstract": "CONTEXT: In recent years, the continuous improvements in molecular biology techniques have made it possible to detect carriers for several genetic conditions, including cystic fibrosis (CF). In some countries, CF carrier screening is offered to increasing subset of the general population. Offering of carrier screening at a population level should not be decided by local health authorities only, without consulting citizens' preferences. One way to involve citizens in the decision process might be to a Citizens' jury, a method of deliberative democracy.\nOBJECTIVE: The object of the study is to produce a recommendation statement about CF carrier screening using a Citizens' jury. As this is a new method in the field, the study also provided the opportunity to evaluate its effectiveness.\nDESIGN: The project is designed and managed by an executive committee. The whole process is superintended by a multidisciplinary scientific committee. The 16 members of the jury attend a 1 day meeting, assisted by a non-medical and unbiased facilitator. Informative material was prepared and distributed 15 days before the jury meeting; during the meeting, experts and witnesses interact directly with all the jurors through questions and answers.\nRESULTS: All except one member of the jury felt positively about the Health Service actively providing population carrier screening for CF. The final statement was available to public, clinicians, researchers and decision-makers.\nDISCUSSION: In general, a Citizens' jury is a feasible method for involving citizens in public health decision-making process and in particular for obtaining a community view about CF carrier screening.",

We compare probabilities of having a positive mutation with complete gene sequencing versus alternatives and describe differences in characteristics among patients with and without mutations.\nRESULTS: Of the 370 patients, 67 (18%) had a genetic mutation; 24 (6%) were of high risk. Mutations were significantly more prevalent with use of complete sequencing (42%) versus other approaches (8%, P < 0.0001). Most (44/67, 66%) with a mutation had no family history. Those with high-risk mutations were more likely to have a family history of chronic pancreatitis (21% vs 4%, P = 0.002).

Subsequently, instead of immediately developing a new disclosure option, we explore relevant foundational ethical values and norms, drawing on the normative and empirical ethical literature. Four ethical signposts are thereby developed to help guide disclosure discussions. These are: respectful sharing of the clinician's expertise; transparent communication; epistemic modesty; and respect for the embedded nature of the patient. We conclude by considering the most common current disclosure positions in the light of the four ethical signposts.",

As a first step, a central advisory committee should be constituted to recommend what is required to be done to strengthen the infrastructure and the manpower to carry out new born screening, and the disorders to be screened. In the urban hospitals newborn screening (NBS) for three disorders can be easily introduced (congenital hypothyroidism, congenital adrenal hyperplasia and G-6-PD deficiency), while in the rural areas this should begin with congenital hypothyroidism, especially in the sub Himalayan areas. Concurrently, logistic issues regarding diets and special therapies for inborn errors of metabolism should be sorted out, laboratories to confirm the diagnosis should be set up, and a cadre of metabolic physicians should be build up to treat those identified to have inborn errors of metabolism. Once these are established on a firm footing, tandem mass spectrometry should be introduced as it allows the identification of a number of disorders in an affordable manner. The recent improvements and current trends in health care in India have created the necessary infrastructure for adopting NBS for the benefit of infants in India.",

This study develops a prioritization score for genetic tests to facilitate equitable allocation based on need-based claims. It includes attributes representing health need associated with hereditary conditions (severity and progression), a genetic service's suitability to alleviate need (evidence of benefit and likelihood of positive result) and costs to meet the needs. A case study for measuring the attributes is provided and a suggestion is made how need-based claims can be quantified in a priority function. Attribute weights can be informed by data from discrete-choice experiments. Further work is needed to measure the attributes across the multitude of genetic tests and to determine appropriate weights. The priority score is most likely to be considered acceptable if developed within a decision process which meets criteria of procedural fairness and if the priority score is interpreted as \"strength of recommendation\" rather than a fixed cut-off value.",

We evaluated whether this genetic risk stratification can also be applied to discriminate between screen-detected and interval cancers, which are usually associated with clinicopathological and survival differences.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: A 77 single-nucleotide polymorphism polygenic risk score (PRS) was constructed for breast cancer overall and by estrogen receptor (ER) status. PRS was inspected as a continuous (per standard deviation increment) variable in a case-only design. Modification of the PRS by mammographic density was evaluated by fitting an additional interaction term.\nRESULTS: PRS weighted by breast cancer overall estimates was found to be differentially associated with 1865 screen-detected and 782 interval cancers in the LIBRO-1 study {age-adjusted odds ratio (OR)perSD [95% confidence interval (CI)] 0.91 [0.83-0.99], P = 0.023}. The association was found to be more significant for PRS weighted by ER-positive breast cancer estimates [ORperSD = 0.90 (0.82-0.98), P = 0.011]. This result was corroborated by two independent studies [combined ORperSD = 0.87 (0.76-1.00), P = 0.058] with no evidence of heterogeneity. When enriched for 'true' interval cancers among nondense breasts, the difference in the association with PRS in screen-detected and interval cancers became more pronounced [ORperSD = 0.74 (0.62-0.89), P = 0.001], with a significant interaction effect between PRS and mammographic density (Pinteraction = 0.017).\nCONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first report looking into the genetic differences between screen-detected and interval cancers. It is an affirmation that the two types of breast cancer may have unique underlying biology.",

The main frame and contents in the MHLW's notification are quite similar to the summaries in the final guidance issued by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on August 6th, 2014 Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff (In Vitro Companion Diagnostic Devices, [2014] ), and these recommend industries to develop, study and submit CDx and the corresponding drug contemporaneously as much as possible. Following the MHLW's notification, the Pharmaceutical and Medical Device Agency (PMDA) notified on December 26th, 2013, \"the technical guidance for co-development of CDx and the drug\" that mentioned the regulatory requirements for clinical trial of the drug and CDx as well as analytical validity of CDx required for the trials. These official notifications from the Ministry and the Agency may be useful for pharmaceutical and diagnostics makers to understand how they should co-develop and validate CDx for clinical trials and regulatory submission. However, since the most anticipated technologies such as the next generation sequencer (NGS) are more complex and its medical risks could be high level, the existing regulatory system focusing on only diagnostics reagents and devices that are developed and manufactured by in vitro diagnostics (IVD) makers may be no longer suitable for the characteristics of CDx for the future.As an increase of clinical needs for multiple biomarkers assay by DNA sequencer, on November 19th, 2013, the FDA cleared 510\u00a0K for NGS and its universal kit. On October 3rd, 2014, moreover, the agency notified two drafts of guidance (Anticipated Details of the Draft Guidance for Industry, Food and Drug Administration Staff, and Clinical Laboratory in Framework for Regulatory Oversight of Laboratory Developed Tests (LDTs), [2014]; Anticipated Details of the Draft Guidance for Industry, Food and Drug Administration Staff, and Clinical Laboratory in FDA Notification and Medical Device Reporting for Laboratory Developed Tests (LDT), [2014]) for oversight of laboratory developed tests (LDTs) with medium or high medical risks. These FDA's strategic decisions and new regulatory frameworks may allow the clinical laboratories to develop and perform more easily NGS-based CDx under the certification of Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA). However, neither law nor regulated quality management system similar to the CLIA exists in Japan. To effectively validate LDTs and NGS for medical practice, Japan should learn more the current regulatory changes and initiatives in the US, as well as to reform the regulatory frameworks and create any regulated quality management system for clinical laboratory testing to be reimbursed.",

Detection rates were not significantly different between adult and pediatric probands but were higher in females compared with males. An expanded gene panel encompassing more than 50 genes identified only a very small number of additional pathogenic variants beyond those identifiable in our original panels, which examined 11 genes. Familial genetic testing in at-risk family members eliminated the need for longitudinal cardiac evaluations in 691 individuals. Based on the projected costs derived from Medicare fee schedules for the recommended clinical evaluations of HCM family members by the American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association, our data indicate that genetic testing resulted in a minimum cost savings of about $0.7 million.\nCONCLUSION: Clinical HCM genetic testing provides a definitive molecular diagnosis for many patients and provides cost savings to families. Expanded gene panels have not substantively increased the clinical sensitivity of HCM testing, suggesting major additional causes of HCM still remain to be identified.",

        "abstract": "The advent and refinement of sequencing technologies has resulted in a decrease in both the cost and time needed to generate data on the entire sequence of the human genome. This has increased the accessibility of using whole-genome sequencing and whole-exome sequencing approaches for analysis in both the research and clinical contexts. The expectation is that more services based on these and other high-throughput technologies will become available to patients and the wider population. Some authors predict that sequencing will be performed once in a lifetime, namely, shortly after birth. The Public and Professional Policy Committee of the European Society of Human Genetics, the Human Genome Organisation Committee on Ethics, Law and Society, the PHG Foundation and the P3G International Paediatric Platform address herein the important issues and challenges surrounding the potential use of sequencing technologies in publicly funded newborn screening (NBS) programmes. This statement presents the relevant issues and culminates in a set of recommendations to help inform and guide scientists and clinicians, as well as policy makers regarding the necessary considerations for the use of genome sequencing technologies and approaches in NBS programmes. The primary objective of NBS should be the targeted analysis and identification of gene variants conferring a high risk of preventable or treatable conditions, for which treatment has to start in the newborn period or in early childhood.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Many regions have implemented newborn screening (NBS) for cystic fibrosis (CF) using a limited panel of cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) mutations after immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) analysis. We sought to assess the feasibility of further improving the screening using next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology.\nMETHODS: An NGS assay was used to detect 162 CFTR mutations/variants characterized by the CFTR2 project. We used 67 dried blood spots (DBSs) containing 48 distinct CFTR mutations to validate the assay. NGS assay was retrospectively performed on 165 CF screen-positive samples with one CFTR mutation.\nRESULTS: The NGS assay was successfully performed using DNA isolated from DBSs, and it correctly detected all CFTR mutations in the validation. Among 165 screen-positive infants with one CFTR mutation, no additional disease-causing mutation was identified in 151 samples consistent with normal sweat tests. Five infants had a CF-causing mutation that was not included in this panel, and nine with two CF-causing mutations were identified.\nCONCLUSION: The NGS assay was 100% concordant with traditional methods. Retrospective analysis results indicate an IRT/NGS screening algorithm would enable high sensitivity, better specificity and positive predictive value (PPV). This study lays the foundation for prospective studies and for introducing NGS in NBS laboratories.",

This study examined 2013-2014 trends in genetics curricula in US and Canadian medical schools to ascertain whether and how curricula are keeping pace with this rapid evolution.\nMETHODS: Medical genetics course directors received a 60-item electronic questionnaire covering curriculum design, assessment, remediation of failing grades, and inclusion of specific topics.\nRESULTS: The response rate was 74%. Most schools teach the majority of genetics during the first 2 years, with an increase in the number of integrated curricula. Only 26% reported formal genetics teaching during years 3 and 4, and most respondents felt the amount of time spent on genetics was insufficient preparation for clinical practice. Most participants are using the Association of Professors of Human and Medical Genetics Core Curriculum(1) as a guide. Topics recently added include personalized medicine (21%) and direct-to-consumer testing (18%), whereas eugenics (17%), linkage analysis (16%), and evolutionary genetics (15%) have been recently eliminated. Remediation strategies were heterogeneous across institutions.\nCONCLUSION: These findings provide an important update on how genetics and genomics is taught at US and Canadian medical schools.

        "abstract": "While pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) is available and legal in Malaysia, there is an ongoing controversy debate about its use. There are few studies available on individuals' attitudes toward PGD, particularly among those who have a genetic disease, or whose children have a genetic disease. To the best of our knowledge, this is, in fact, the first study of its kind in Malaysia. We conducted in-depth interviews, using semi-structured questionnaires, with seven selected potential PGD users regarding their knowledge, attitudes and decisions relating to the use PGD. The criteria for selecting potential PGD users were that they or their children had a genetic disease, and they desired to have another child who would be free of genetic disease. All participants had heard of PGD and five of them were considering its use. The participants' attitudes toward PGD were based on several different considerations that were influenced by various factors. These included: the benefit-risk balance of PGD, personal experiences of having a genetic disease, religious beliefs, personal values and cost. The study's findings suggest that the selected Malaysian participants, as potential PGD users, were supportive but cautious regarding the use of PGD for medical purposes, particularly in relation to others whose experiences were similar. More broadly, the paper highlights the link between the participants' personal experiences and their beliefs regarding the appropriateness, for others, of individual decision-making on PGD, which has not been revealed by previous studies.",

        "abstract": "The past decade has witnessed rapid advances in human genome sequencing technology and in the understanding of the role of genetic and epigenetic alterations in cancer development. These advances have raised hopes that such knowledge could lead to improvements in behavioral risk reduction interventions, tailored screening recommendations, and treatment matching that together could accelerate the war on cancer. Despite this optimism, translation of genomic discovery for clinical and public health applications has moved relatively slowly. To date, health psychologists and the behavioral sciences generally have played a very limited role in translation research. In this report we discuss what we mean by genomic translational research and consider the social forces that have slowed translational research, including normative assumptions that translation research must occur downstream of basic science, thus relegating health psychology and other behavioral sciences to a distal role. We then outline two broad priority areas in cancer prevention, detection, and treatment where evidence will be needed to guide evaluation and implementation of personalized genomics: (a) effective communication, to broaden dissemination of genomic discovery, including patient-provider communication and familial communication, and (b) the need to improve the motivational impact of behavior change interventions, including those aimed at altering lifestyle choices and those focusing on decision making regarding targeted cancer treatments and chemopreventive adherence. We further discuss the role that health psychologists can play in interdisciplinary teams to shape translational research priorities and to evaluate the utility of emerging genomic discoveries for cancer prevention and control.",

We sought to create a proof-of-concept decision support alert system generated from pharmacogenomic incidental findings from exome sequencing.\nMETHODS: A pipeline for alerts from exome sequencing tests was created for patients in the New EXome Technology in (NEXT) Medicine study at the University of Washington. Decision support rules using discrete, machine-readable incidental finding results were programmed into a commercial EHR rules engine. An evaluation plan to monitor the alerts in real medical interactions was established.\nRESULTS: Alerts were created for 48 actionable pharmacogenomic variants in 11 genes and were launched on 24 September 2014 for University of Washington inpatient care. Of the 94 participants enrolled in the NEXT Medicine study, 49 had one or more pharmacogenomic variants identified for return.\nCONCLUSION: Reflections on the process reveal that while incidental findings can be used to generate decision support alerts, substantial resources are required to ensure that each alert is consistent with rapidly evolving pharmacogenomic literature and is customized to fit in the clinical workflow unique to each incidental finding.",

The purpose of this comparative study was to determine whether one academic laboratory's model of variant interpretation is similar to that of several commercial laboratories.\nMETHODS: The Collagen Diagnostic Laboratory (CDL) received, over a 14-month period, 38 requests to interpret variants originally identified by an outside laboratory (OL). The interpretations by the OL and CDL were compared and discrepancies were assessed.\nRESULTS: Interpretations from the OL and CDL were concordant in 11 inquiries (29%); discrepancies were moderate in 11 instances (29%) and significant in 16 (42%). Factors that caused discrepancies included the following: (i) private data were not shared in a public database (n = 9); (ii) publicly available allele frequency data were not referenced and used as evidence (n = 5); and (iii) important aspects of protein structure and function were not taken into account (n = 13).\nCONCLUSION: Comprehensive interpretation of sequence variants depends on good functional tests and well-curated variant databases. Provision of clinical information to the clinical laboratory, mandatory submission of identified variants with phenotype data to common resources, and collaboration between clinical laboratories and recognized experts is likely to improve consistency in variant interpretation among clinical laboratories.Genet Med 18 1, 20-24.",

We sought to obtain patient feedback and early outcome data with a novel tiered-binned model for multiplex testing.\nMETHODS: BRCA1/2-negative and untested patients completed pre- and posttest counseling and surveys evaluating testing experiences and cognitive and affective responses to multiplex testing.\nRESULTS: Of 73 patients, 49 (67%) completed pretest counseling. BRCA1/2-negative patients were more likely to proceed with multiplex testing (86%) than those untested for BRCA1/2 (43%; P < 0.01). Many patients declining testing reported concern for uncertainty and distress. Most patients would not change anything about their pre- (76%) or posttest (89%) counseling sessions. Thirty-three patients (72%) were classified as making an informed choice, including 81% of those who proceeded with multiplex testing. Knowledge increased significantly. Anxiety, depression, uncertainty, and cancer worry did not significantly increase with multiplex testing.\nCONCLUSION: Some patients, particularly those without prior BRCA1/2 testing, decline multiplex testing. Most patients who proceeded with testing did not experience negative psychological responses, but larger studies are needed. The tiered-binned approach is an innovative genetic counseling and informed consent model for further study in the era of multiplex testing.Genet Med 18 1, 25-33.",

Testing records from two prenatal serum screening laboratories examined temporal trends in the proportion of screened women 35 years of age and older from 2008 (or 2009) to 2014.\nRESULTS: The 82 laboratory survey results available for comparison showed that 1.7 million women were screened in 2014, a 5% increase over 2011. In the two screening laboratories, the proportion of screened women age 35 and older increased for several years but then experienced reductions of 8 and 18% by mid-2014 when compared with the highest rates observed.\nCONCLUSION: As of 2014, maternal plasma DNA testing appears to have had only a minor impact on serum screening rates in the United States.

Information regarding treatable diseases (94.3%) and diseases that could affect their children (84.9%) were more desirable than that regarding untreatable diseases (71.7%). Sixty percent of FDMs understood that GTEx would not return genetic results. FDMs were four times more likely to have correct knowledge of the GTEx policy when their GTEx requester reported discussing the topic with them.\nCONCLUSION: FDMs from the GTEx project were interested in receiving genetic test results. Marked changes in the infrastructure of the GTEx would be required to alter the policy. Regardless, care must be taken to ensure that the return policy is clearly communicated with FDMs to dispel misconceptions.Genet Med 18 1, 82-88.",

Before individuals can decide with certainty whether or not to take these tests, they first need to grasp the many psychosocial and clinical dimensions of prenatal genetic testing.\nOBJECTIVE: To test a model integrating key psychosocial and clinical factors as predictors of decisional conflict in decisions about whether or not to undergo prenatal genetic testing.\nMETHOD: Adults (n = 457) read one of four hypothetical scenarios asking them to imagine expecting a child and considering the option of a prenatal test able to detect a genetic condition; age of condition onset (birth vs. adulthood) and its curability (no cure vs. curable) were manipulated. Participants completed measures of decisional conflict, perceived benefits from normal results, test response efficacy, condition coherence, child-related worry, perceived disagreement with the other parent's preference, motivation to comply with doctors' perceived preferences, and parity.\nRESULTS: Prenatal testing decisional conflict was positively predicted by perceiving normal results as beneficial, doubting the test's reliability, lacking understanding of the genetic condition, worrying about the health of the foetus, perceiving differences of opinion from partner/spouse, wanting to follow doctors' preferences, and being childless.\nDISCUSSION: These results, of growing relevance given the increasing availability of new technologies in pregnancy care, can inform communication strategies that facilitate couples' decision making.\nCONCLUSION: This study provides insights into factors that might complicate prenatal testing decision making.",

This study explored the psychological impact (in terms of general and PrCa-specific worry and risk perceptions) on men with a family history of PrCa, undergoing prostate screening and genetic-risk profiling, within a research study.\nMETHODS: A prospective exploratory approach was adopted, incorporating a sequential mixed-method design. Questionnaires were completed at two time points to measure the impact of undergoing screening and genetic-risk profiling. In-depth interviews were completed in a subgroup after all study procedures were completed and analysed using a framework approach.\nRESULTS: Ninety-five men completed both questionnaires, and 26 were interviewed. No measurable psychological distress was detectable in the group as a whole. The interview findings fell into two categories: 'feeling at risk' and 'living with risk'. The feeling of being at risk of PrCa is a part of men's lives, shaped by assumptions and information gathered over many years. Men used this information to communicate about PrCa risk to their peers. Men overestimate their risk of PrCa and have an innate assumption that they will develop PrCa. The interviews revealed that men experienced acute anxiety when waiting for screening results.\nCONCLUSIONS: Personalised genetic-risk assessments do not prevent men from overestimating their risk of PrCa. Screening anxiety is common, and timeframes for receiving results should be kept to a minimum. Methods of risk communication in men at risk of PrCa should be the subject of future research.",

Telegenetics could be an effective and efficient way of counseling, but its use in Europe is not widely reported, nor is there evidence of international collaboration. We conducted an online survey among 929 genetics professionals, to explore the current availability and use of different telegenetics modalities in Europe. Our questionnaire was completed by 104 clinically active European genetics professionals. Telephone genetic counseling was used by 17% of respondents. Videoconferencing facilities were available to 24%, but only 9% of them used these for patient counseling. Various barriers to availability and use were cited, ranging from practical constraints, lack of professional support/knowledge, to lack of perceived suitability and need. The results show that telegenetics modalities are not currently in widespread use by our respondents, in part due to perceived barriers. To meet the changing economic, genetic, and societal circumstances, we recommend consideration of greater integration of telegenetics into regular clinical genetic care, to supplement existing care modalities. Professional cooperation, sharing knowledge, and establishing guidelines on a national and international level could contribute to successful and more widespread implementation of telegenetics.

There is increasing pressure to return research findings to participants that may not be related to the project aims, particularly when these could be used to prevent disease. Such secondary, unsolicited or 'incidental findings' (IFs) may be discovered unintentionally when interpreting sequence data, or as the result of a deliberate opportunistic screen. This cross-sectional, web-based survey investigated attitudes of 6944 individuals from 75 countries towards returning IFs from genome research. Participants included four relevant stakeholder groups: 4961 members of the public, 533 genetic health professionals, 843 non-genetic health professionals and 607 genomic researchers who were invited via traditional media, social media and professional e-mail list-serve. Treatability and perceived utility of incidental results were deemed important with 98% of stakeholders personally interested in learning about preventable life-threatening conditions. Although there was a generic interest in receiving genomic information, stakeholders did not expect researchers to opportunistically screen for IFs in a research setting. On many items, genetic health professionals had significantly more conservative views compared with other stakeholders. This finding demonstrates a disconnect between the views of those handling the findings of research and those participating in research. Exploring, evaluating and ultimately addressing this disconnect should form a priority for researchers and clinicians alike. This social sciences study offers the largest dataset, published to date, of attitudes towards issues surrounding the return of IFs from sequencing research.",

We tested whether response to a substance use prevention/intervention program varies based upon a set of five markers (rs16969968, rs1948, rs578776, rs588765, and rs684513) within the cluster of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit genes (CHRNA5/A3/B4).\nMETHODS: Participants (N = 424) were randomly assigned to either control condition, or a family-based intervention in grade 6 and a school-based drug preventive intervention in grade 7. Smoking in the past month was assessed in grades 9-12 using a four-point scale (0 = never smoked, 1 = smoked but not in last month, 2 = one or a few times, 3 = about once a week or more).\nRESULTS: There was a main effect of both the intervention (b = -0.24, P < .05) and genotype at rs16969968 (b = 0.14, P < .05) on high school smoking. Using dummy coding to allow for nonlinear effects, individuals with the A/A genotype smoked more often than those with G/G (b = 0.33, P < .05).

        "abstract": "Inheritance of a germline mutation in one of the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes or the EPCAM gene is associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer, endometrial cancer, and other adult malignancies (Lynch syndrome). The risk of childhood cancers in Lynch syndrome families, however, is not well studied. Using data from the Colon Cancer Family Registry, we compared the proportion of childhood cancers (diagnosed before 18 years of age) in the first-, second-, and third-degree relatives of 781 probands with a pathogenic mutation in one of the MMR genes; MLH1 (n = 275), MSH2 (n = 342), MSH6 (n = 99), or PMS2 (n = 55) or in EPCAM (n = 10) (Lynch syndrome families), with that of 5073 probands with MMR-deficient colorectal cancer (non-Lynch syndrome families). There was no evidence of a difference in the proportion of relatives with a childhood cancer between Lynch syndrome families (41/17,230; 0.24%) and non-Lynch syndrome families (179/94,302; 0.19%; p = 0.19). Incidence rate of all childhood cancers was estimated to be 147 (95% CI 107-206) per million population per year in Lynch syndrome families and 115 (95% CI 99.1-134) per million population per year in non-Lynch syndrome families. There was no evidence for a significant increase in the risk of all childhood cancers, hematologic cancers, brain and central nervous system cancers, Lynch syndrome-associated cancers, or other cancers in Lynch syndrome families compared with non-Lynch syndrome families. Larger studies, however, are required to more accurately define the risk of specific individual childhood cancers in Lynch syndrome families.",

        "abstract": "The monogenic Lynch syndrome (LS) is associated with better survival in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. Whether family history of CRC affects CRC prognosis in general remains unclear. We evaluated overall mortality in a Danish cohort of CRC patients comparing patients with a family history (FHpos) to those without (FHneg) with focus on patients from non-syndromic families, thus FHpos patients were further divided into a non-syndromic group (FHNS) and a HNPCC/LS group (FHHNPCC). We included CRC patients diagnosed 1995-1998. First degree relatives were identified using Danish population registries and family history was obtained by linkage to Danish medical registries. 1- and 5-year mortality were evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression, with adjustment for age, sex, cancer site, cancer stage, and comorbidity. 1196 CRC patients were included in the study, 219 FHpos patients of whom 197 were FHNS patients. 1- and 5-year adjusted Mortality Rate Ratios comparing FHpos patients to FHneg patients were 0.99 (95% CI 0.69, 1.42) and 1.07 (95% CI 0.87, 1.32), respectively. For FHNS patients, the corresponding MRRs were 1.01 (95% CI 0.69, 1.47) and 1.15 (95% CI 0.93, 1.43). For the FHHNPCC patients MRRs were 0.84 (95% CI 0.29, 2.44) and 0.66 (95% CI 0.33, 1.31), respectively.

        "abstract": "Ancestry-based carrier screening in the Ashkenazi Jewish population entails screening for specific autosomal recessive founder mutations, which are rarer among the general population. As it is now technically feasible to screen for many more diseases, the question arises whether this population prefers a limited ancestry-based offer or a pan-ethnic expanded carrier screening panel that goes beyond the diseases that are frequent in their own population, and is offered regardless of ancestry. An online questionnaire was completed by 145 individuals from the Dutch Jewish community (\u2265 18 years) between April and July 2014. In total, 64.8% were aware of the existence of ancestry-based carrier screening, and respondents were generally positive about screening. About half (53.8%) preferred pan-ethnic expanded carrier screening, whereas 42.8% preferred ancestry-based screening. Reasons for preferring pan-ethnic screening included 'everyone has a right to be tested', 'fear of stigmatization when offering ancestry-based panels', and 'difficulties with identifying risk owing to mixed backgrounds'. 'Preventing high healthcare costs' was the most important reason against pan-ethnic carrier screening among those in favor of an ancestry-based panel. In conclusion, these findings show that people from the Dutch Jewish community have a positive attitude regarding carrier screening in their community for a wide range of diseases. As costs of expanded carrier screening panels are most likely to drop in the near future, it is expected that these panels will receive more support in the future.",

The heritable fraction of ovarian cancer is more than 10%, and our department has offered BRCA testing to such patients irrespective of family history since 2002. This study examined potential psychosocial distress associated with this procedure using The Multidimensional Impact of Cancer Risk Assessment (MICRA) questionnaire and other patient-rated generic distress instruments. Patients were divided into four groups according to cancer risk: mutation carriers, own history of breast cancer and ovarian cancer, family history of breast cancer and/or ovarian cancer, and patients without family history. In a postal survey, 354 patients responded. Good acceptance of the MICRA was observed, and previously described good psychometric properties were confirmed. A significant association between MICRA total score and receiving a positive BRCA test result was found. No significant between-group differences were observed with generic distress instruments. Time since cancer diagnosis, test result, and survey showed no significant associations with MICRA scores. Internal consistencies of instruments were adequate. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses showed adequate fit indices for a three factor solution of the MICRA, but further refinement of the items should be considered. In conclusion, the specific types of worry and distress most relevant to receiving genetic testing irrespective of family history were not captured by the generic distress instruments. The MICRA was supported as a useful tool for detection of mental distress related to genetic testing and risk evaluation.",

This study examines HTAs of an early clinical example of Personalized Medicine (gene expression profile tests [GEP] for breast cancer prognosis) aiming to: (i) identify ELSI; (ii) assess whether ELSIs are implicitly or explicitly addressed; and (iii) report methodology used for ELSI integration.\nMETHODS: A systematic search for HTAs (January 2004 to September 2012), followed by descriptive and qualitative content analysis.\nRESULTS: Seventeen HTAs for GEP were retrieved. Only three (18%) explicitly presented ELSI, and only one reported methodology. However, all of the HTAs included implicit ELSI. Eight themes of implicit and explicit ELSI were identified. \"Classical\" ELSI including privacy, informed consent, and concerns about limited patient/clinician genetic literacy were always presented explicitly. Some ELSI, including the need to understand how individual patients' risk tolerances affect clinical decision-making after reception of GEP results, were presented both explicitly and implicitly in HTAs. Others, such as concern about evidentiary deficiencies for clinical utility of GEP tests, occurred only implicitly.\nCONCLUSIONS: Despite a wide variety of important ELSI raised, these were rarely explicitly addressed in HTAs. Explicit treatment would increase their accessibility to decision-makers, and may augment HTA efficiency maximizing their utility. This is particularly important where complex Personalized Medicine applications are rapidly expanding choices for patients, clinicians and healthcare systems.",

The findings showed that the genetic counsellors added value in the clinical setting by acting as the 'spider-in-the-web' regarding case management, having a more holistic, ethical and psychological perspective, being able to offer continuous support and build a relationship with the patient, and being more accessible than medical geneticists. The main difference between a genetic counsellor and medical geneticist was that the doctor had the main medical responsibility.

In this study, comprehensive BRCA1 and BRCA2 testing was performed in a routine diagnostic setting. The prevalence of the BRCA1 stop mutation c.4183C>T, p.(Gln1395Ter), was determined in unselected breast and ovarian cancer patients from different regions in the Tyrol. Cancer registry data were used to evaluate the impact of this mutation on regional cancer incidence. The mutation c.4183C>T was detected in 30.4% of hereditary BRCA1-associated breast and ovarian cancer patients in our cohort. It was also identified in 4.1% of unselected (26% of unselected triple negative) Tyrolean breast cancer patients and 6.8% of unselected ovarian cancer patients from the Lower Inn Valley (LIV) region. Cancer incidences showed a region-specific increase in age-stratified breast and ovarian cancer risk with standardized incidence ratios of 1.23 and 2.13, respectively. We, thus, report a Tyrolean BRCA1 founder mutation that correlates to a local increase in the breast and ovarian cancer risks. On the basis of its high prevalence, we suggest that targeted genetic analysis should be offered to all women with breast or ovarian cancer and ancestry from the LIV region.",

The poor introduction of the genetic testing of BRCA in Japan compared with western countries could be due to insufficient recognition of its importance, prejudice against a heredity disease, especially in non-urban districts, and its high cost. There is few available data regarding the acceptance or willingness to have genetic testing among Japanese who are at risk and living outside Tokyo.\nMETHODS: Of 670 patients seen and detailed family history taken at our hospital, located non-urban, 30 (4\u00a0%) gave the family history of breast cancer in more than 2 members within the second degree relatives (\"stronger\" family history group), 92 (14\u00a0%) in 1 member (\"weaker\" group), and 548 (82\u00a0%) in none of members (\"sporadic\" group). Then, we selected 107 (24 from \"stronger\", 50 from \"weaker\", 33 from \"sporadic\" family history group) to see if they are willing to receive cost-free genetic testing of BRCA 1 and BRCA2.\nRESULTS: Ninety-two of 107 (86\u00a0%) patients agreed and 15 (14\u00a0%) refused. The rate of refusal for BRCA testing was higher in \"stronger family history group\" (6/24, 25\u00a0%) compared to \"weaker\" (7/50, 14\u00a0%) or \"sporadic\" (2/33, 6\u00a0%) (p\u00a0=\u00a00.04), respectively.\nCONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that the currently available preventive measures and/or counseling system may not be sufficient enough to convince the high risk population to receive the genetic testing or to overcome the prejudice in non-urban area in Japan, even if served free.",

Variants in four genes have been reported to cause the classical autosomal-dominant form of the disease. FH is largely under-diagnosed in European countries. As FH increases the risk for coronary artery disease (CAD) and myocardial infarction (MI), it might be specifically overlooked in the large number of such patients. Here, we systematically examined the frequency of potential FH-causing variants by exome sequencing in 255 German patients with premature MI and a positive family history for CAD. We further performed co-segregation analyses in an average of 5.5 family members per MI patient. In total, we identified 11 potential disease-causing variants that co-segregate within the families, that is, 5% of patients with premature MI and positive CAD family history had FH. Eight variants were previously reported as disease-causing and three are novel (LDLR.c.811G>A p.(V271I)), PCSK9.c.610G>A (p.(D204N)) and STAP1.c.139A>G (p.(T47A))). Co-segregation analyses identified multiple additional family members carrying one of these FH variants and the clinical phenotype of either FH (n=2) or FH and premature CAD (n=15). However, exome sequencing also revealed that some variants in FH genes, which have been reported to cause FH, do not co-segregate with FH. The data reveal that a large proportion of FH patients escape the diagnosis, even when they have premature MI. Hence, systematic molecular-genetic screening for FH in such patients may reveal a substantial number of cases and thereby allow a timely LDLC-lowering in both FH/MI patients as well as their variant-carrying family members.",

This article begins to address the gap in the literature concerning psychosocial effects of \"genomic NBS,\" focusing on later effects of screening for genetic susceptibility to a single, complex disorder: type 1 diabetes (T1D). It also examines parental attitudes toward potential future expansions of NBS.\nMETHODS: Fifteen semistructured interviews were conducted with parents of children who had been tested for genetic susceptibility to T1D 12 years previously.\nRESULTS: Parents in this study were not psychologically burdened by knowledge of their child's genetic risk but perceived little benefit. Most of these parents disclosed the result to their child at age 12 years without obvious adverse impact. Parents were unenthusiastic about potential future expansions of NBS to include similar genomic tests.\nCONCLUSIONS: Absence of adverse psychosocial effects and ease of disclosure to the child represent initial positive findings, but they require replication and further evaluation in relation to uptake of prevention strategies. Attitudes of parents to \"genomic NBS\" are variable, suggesting that parental choice will be an important component of future screening programs.",

Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-tyrosine kinase inhibitors can increase progression-free survival compared with standard chemotherapy in patients with EGFR mutation-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).\nOBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of EGFR mutation analysis and first-line therapy with erlotinib for mutation-positive patients compared with non-individualized standard chemotherapy from the perspective of German statutory health insurance.\nMETHODS: A state transition model was developed for a time horizon of 10 years (reference year 2014). Data sources were published data from the European Tarceva versus Chemotherapy (EURTAC) randomized trial for drug efficacy and safety and German cost data. We additionally performed deterministic, probabilistic and structural sensitivity analyses.\nRESULTS: The individualized strategy incurred 0.013 additional quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and additional costs of \u20ac 200, yielding an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of \u20ac 15,577/QALY. Results were most sensitive to uncertainty in survival curves and changes in utility values. Cross-validating health utility estimates with recent German data increased the ICER to about \u20ac 58,000/QALY. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated that the individualized strategy is cost-effective, with a probability exceeding 50 % for a range of possible willingness-to-pay thresholds.\nLIMITATIONS: The uncertainty of the predicted survival curves is substantial, particularly for overall survival, which was not a primary endpoint in the EURTAC study. Also, there is limited data on quality of life in metastatic lung cancer patients.\nCONCLUSIONS: Individualized therapy based on EGFR mutation status has the potential to provide a cost-effective alternative to non-individualized care for patients with advanced adenocarcinoma.

It is included in many neonatal screening programs to prevent morbidity and mortality from salt-wasting and to reduce long-term health problems. This paper presents a population-based evaluation of CAH screening quality and outcome in Bavaria between 1999 and 2011 including long-term follow-up of patients.\nMETHODS: Screening process quality, clinical complications during the neonatal period, treatment and development of patients up to the age of 4 years were analysed.\nRESULTS: Among 1\u2009420\u2009102 screened infants, 114 cases of 21-OHD classic CAH were detected (prevalence 1:12\u2009457). Mean age at start of treatment was 7 days. However, in 29 cases (25.4%), age at start of treatment was 12 days or more. The frequency of neonatal salt-wasting increased with age at start of treatment, but all neonatal salt-wasting episodes and crises were managed successfully. Up to the age of 4 years, developmental assessment of the CAH cohort yielded normal results.\nDISCUSSION: Epidemiological and screening effectiveness results are in keeping with other publications. For the most part, screening process times were compliant with guidelines. The Bavarian CAH screening and tracking system proved successful, but there were process delays and complications which might have been avoidable. The outcome supports the benefits of CAH screening, but further research is necessary to increase CAH screening effectiveness and to evaluate long-term effects.",

In the last two decades multiple public campaigns have sought to increase the awareness of melanoma. Family history of melanoma is a known major risk factor but previous studies have shown that self-reported family history of melanoma is highly inaccurate. These studies are 15 years old and we wanted to examine if a higher awareness of melanoma has increased the accuracy of self-reported family history of melanoma. We examined the family history of 181 melanoma probands who reported 199 cases of melanoma in relatives, of which 135 cases where in first degree relatives. We confirmed the diagnosis of melanoma in 77% of all relatives, and in 83% of first degree relatives. In 181 probands we validated the negative family history of melanoma in 748 first degree relatives and found only 1 case of melanoma which was not reported in a 3 case melanoma family. Melanoma patients in Denmark report family history of melanoma in first and second degree relatives with a high level of accuracy with a true positive predictive value between 77 and 87%. In 99% of probands reporting a negative family history of melanoma in first degree relatives this information is correct. In clinical practice we recommend that melanoma diagnosis in relatives should be verified if possible, but even unverified reported melanoma cases in relatives should be included in the indication of genetic testing and assessment of melanoma risk in the family.",

        "abstract": "Next generation sequencing (NGS) technology is rapidly being implemented into clinical practice. Qualitative research was performed to gain an improved understanding of the landscape surrounding the use of NGS in cancer genetics. A focus group was conducted at the Wisconsin Cancer Risk Programs Network biannual meeting. Free flowing discussion with occasional open-ended questions provided insights into the use of NGS. 19 genetic counselors and medical professionals participated. Three major themes were identified with respect to NGS and its use in cancer genetics: knowledge gaps, the evolving clinician role, and uncertain utility. Several corresponding subthemes were identified. With respect to knowledge gaps, participants expressed concern regarding unexpected results and variants of unknown significance, lack of data about NGS findings, absence of standardization regarding use of NGS and guidelines for interpretation, and discomfort with new technology. Regarding the evolving clinician role, necessary changes to the roles of genetic counselors and physicians were noted, as was the resultant impact on care received by patients and their families. Finally, the clinical and economic utility of NGS was questioned. While a shift from traditional Sanger sequencing to NGS is occurring in molecular genetic testing for disease susceptibility, there are several obstacles that need to be overcome before widespread adoption of this technology can occur. Furthermore, key aspects of NGS and it utility remain unexplored. Continued investigation into these subjects is necessary before this technology will consistently be of benefit to patients and their families.",

        "title": "Outcomes of a randomised controlled trial of a complex genetic counselling intervention to improve family communication.",
        "abstract": "When an inherited genetic condition is diagnosed in an individual it has implications for other family members. Privacy legislation and ethical considerations can restrict health professionals from communicating directly with other family members, and so it is frequently the responsibility of the first person in a family to receive the diagnosis (the proband) to share this news. Communication of genetic information is challenging and many at-risk family members remain unaware of important information that may be relevant to their or their children's health. We conducted a randomised controlled trial in six public hospitals to assess whether a specifically designed telephone counselling intervention improved family communication about a new genetic diagnosis. Ninety-five probands/parents of probands were recruited from genetics clinics and randomised to the intervention or control group. The primary outcome measure was the difference between the proportion of at-risk relatives who contacted genetics services for information and/or genetic testing. Audit of the family genetic file after 18 months revealed that 25.6% of intervention group relatives compared with 20.9% of control group relatives made contact with genetic services (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.30, 95% confidence interval 0.70-2.42, P=0.40). Although no major difference was detected overall between the intervention and control groups, there was more contact in the intervention group where the genetic condition conferred a high risk to offspring (adjusted OR 24.0, 95% confidence interval 3.4-168.5, P=0.001). The increasing sophistication and scope of genetic testing makes it imperative for health professionals to consider additional ways of supporting families in communicating genetic information.",

        "abstract": "AIM: Pharmacogenetic studies have identified the presence of the HLA-A*31:01 allele as a predictor of cutaneous adverse drugs reactions (ADRs) to carbamazepine. This study aimed to ascertain the preferences of patients and clinicians to inform carbamazepine pharmacogenetic testing services.\nMETHODS: Attributes of importance to people with epilepsy and neurologists were identified through interviews and from published sources. Discrete choice experiments (DCEs) were conducted in 82 people with epilepsy and 83 neurologists. Random-effects logit regression models were used to determine the importance of the attributes and direction of effect.\nRESULTS: In the patient DCE, all attributes (seizure remission, reduction in seizure frequency, memory problems, skin rash and rare, severe ADRs) were significant. The estimated utility of testing was greater, at 0.52 (95% CI 0.19, 1.00) than not testing at 0.33 (95% CI -0.07, 0.81). In the physician DCE, cost, inclusion in the British National Formulary, coverage, negative predictive value (NPV) and positive predictive value (PPV) were significant. Marginal rates of substitution indicated that neurologists were willing to pay \u00a35.87 for a 1 percentage point increase in NPV and \u00a33.99 for a 1 percentage point increase in PPV.\nCONCLUSION: The inclusion of both patients' and clinicians' perspectives represents an important contribution to the understanding of preferences towards pharmacogenetic testing prior to initiating carbamazepine. Both groups identified different attributes but had generally consistent preferences. Patients' acceptance of a decrease in treatment benefit for a reduced chance of severe ADRs adds support for the implementation of HLA-A*31:01 testing in routine practice.",

        "abstract": "Creation of an advanced degree in genetic counseling has been considered since the early 1980s. The Genetic Counseling Advanced Degree Task Force (GCADTF) was convened in 2012 to formally explore the potential suitability of a clinical doctorate (ClinD), though employer perspectives of advanced training were not part of the discussion. The conclusion of this group was that the field was not ready to move to an entry-level clinical doctorate at this time but that further education and research among other stakeholders was necessary (Nagy et al. 2014). In this study, we describe employers' perspectives on developing a clinical doctorate in genetic counseling based upon thirty audio-recorded semi-structured phone interviews that were transcribed verbatim and qualitatively analyzed. Overall, employers expressed concerns regarding the economic viability of ClinD training but envisioned expanded roles for genetic counselors (especially in areas of education and research) and enhanced credibility. While some employers reported that they would provide flexibility and tuition assistance for acquisition of a ClinD, for many employers, support was contingent on perceived value of the degree. Some employers were not clear about the difference between a ClinD and a PhD, suggesting that there is a need for educating employers about advanced degree options for the genetic counseling field. Future research could include investigating employer attitudes about market needs, envisioned roles, and compensation formulas for counselors with a ClinD or other forms of advanced training.",

Obtaining informed consent becomes more challenging as the number of screened conditions increases. Implementing a model of generic informed consent may facilitate informed decision-making. Current Wayne State University students and staff were invited to complete a web-based survey by blast email solicitation. Participants were asked to determine which of two generic informed consent scenarios they preferred: a brief versus a detailed consent. They were asked to rank the importance of different informational components in making an informed decision and to provide demographic information. Comparisons between informational preferences, demographic variables and scenario preferences were made. Six hundred ninety three participants completed the survey. When evaluating these generic consents, the majority preferred the more detailed consent (74.5%), and agreed that it provided enough information to make an informed decision (89.5%). Those who thought it would be more important to know the severity of the conditions being screened (p\u2009=\u2009.002) and range of symptoms (p\u2009=\u2009.000) were more likely to prefer the more detailed consent. There were no significant associations between scenario preferences and demographic variables. A generic consent was perceived to provide sufficient information for informed decision making regarding multiplex carrier screening with most preferring a more detailed version of the consent. Individual attitudes rather than demographic variables influenced preferences regarding the amount of information that should be included in the generic consent. The findings have implications for how clinicians approach providing tailored informed consent.",

We addressed this by interviewing 29 genetic counselors and research coordinators experienced in obtaining informed consent for sequencing in research and clinical settings. Interviews focused on the process and content of informed consent; patients/participants' common questions, concerns and misperceptions; and challenges to obtaining informed consent. Content analysis of transcribed interviews revealed that the main challenges to obtaining consent related to the broad scope and uncertainty of results, and patient/participants' unrealistic expectations about the likely number and utility of results. Interviewees modified their approach to sessions according to contextual issues surrounding the indication for testing, type of patient, and timing of testing. With experience, most interviewees structured sessions to place less emphasis on standard elements in the consent form and technological aspects of sequencing. They instead focused on addressing misperceptions and helping patients/participants develop realistic expectations about the types and implications of possible results, including secondary findings. These findings suggest that informed consent sessions should focus on key issues that may be misunderstood by patients/participants. Future research should address the extent to which various stakeholders agree on key elements of informed consent.",

We evaluated familial risk of CRC, systematically excluding monogenetic high-risk families with polyposis or Lynch syndrome/hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC).\nMETHODS: FDRs of 1196 Danish CRC patients diagnosed between 1995 and 1998 (baseline) were identified and the family history of cancer was assessed at baseline using Danish medical registries; 4182 FDRs without CRC from 1060 of the families were matched on age and gender with ten individuals from the general population and followed from baseline to 2010. Family history was updated with any new cancer event during follow-up.\nRESULTS: Using Cox proportional hazard modeling the risk estimates were: at least one relative with CRC: hazard ratio (HR)=1.78 (95%CI: 1.45, 2.17), one relative with CRC diagnosed after the age of 50: HR=1.68 (95%CI: 1.32, 2.14), one relative with CRC diagnosed before the age of 50: HR=1.86 (95%CI: 0.70, 4.94), and multiple affected relatives: HR=2.04 (95%CI: 1.38, 3.00).\nCONCLUSION: Although the overall risk in FDRs of CRC patients in our study was comparable with the results of previous studies, the risk in families with multiple relatives with CRC or one CRC patient diagnosed young may be lower than reported previously.",

        "abstract": "Activating mutations in downstream genes of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway may cause anti-EGFR resistance in patients with colorectal cancers. We present performance characteristics of a next-generation sequencing assay designed to detect such mutations. In this retrospective quality assessment study, we analyzed mutation detected in the KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA genes by a clinically validated next-generation sequencing assay in 310 colorectal cancer specimens. Tumor cellularity and mutant allele frequency were analyzed to identify tumor heterogeneity and mutant allele-specific imbalance. Next-generation sequencing showed precise measurement of mutant allele frequencies and detected 23% of mutations with 2-20% mutant allele frequencies. Of the KRAS mutations detected, 17% were outside of codons 12 and 13. Among PIK3CA mutations, 48% were outside of codons 542, 545, and 1047. The percentage of tumors with predicted resistance to anti-EGFR therapy increased from 40% when testing for only mutations in KRAS exon 2 to 47% when testing for KRAS exons 2-4, 48% when testing for KRAS and NRAS exons 2-4, 58% when including BRAF codon 600 mutations, and 59% when adding PIK3CA exon 20 mutations. Right-sided colorectal cancers carried a higher risk of predicted anti-EGFR resistance. A concomitant KRAS mutation was detected in 51% of PIK3CA, 23% of NRAS, and 33% of kinase-impaired BRAF-mutated tumors. Lower than expected mutant allele frequency indicated tumor heterogeneity, while higher than expected mutant allele frequency indicated mutant allele-specific imbalance. Two paired neuroendocrine carcinomas and adjacent adenomas showed identical KRAS mutations, but only PIK3CA mutations in neuroendocrine carcinomas. Next-generation sequencing is a robust tool for mutation detection in clinical laboratories. It demonstrates high analytic sensitivity and broad reportable range, and it provides simultaneous detection of concomitant mutations and a quantitative measurement of mutant allele frequencies to predict tumor heterogeneity and mutant allele-specific imbalance.",

The primary aim of this study was to assess overall value and success of genetic counseling in prenatal and reproductive care with regard to perceived personal control of clients, reflecting also in a part patient comprehension, knowledge retention, and empowerment in decision-making. The standardized Perceived Personal Control questionnaire (PPC) was used for the assessment of 239 female participants. First, we performed a complete validation of the psychometric characteristics of the Serbian-language version of the PPC questionnaire. The validation of the questionnaire permits other researchers from Serbian-speaking regions of South-East Europe to use this standard instrument to assess the effectiveness of prenatal genetic counseling in their communities and analyze advantages and disadvantages of their counseling models. We also measured social and demographic characteristics of participants. Further, we analyzed effects of our team-based prenatal and reproductive genetic counseling model through (a) calculation of PPC scores at three different stages (before initial, after initial, and before second counseling session), and (b) by assessing participants' responses by indication for referral (advanced maternal age, abnormal biochemical screening, family history of hereditary disorders, maternal exposure to drugs, exposure to radiation, exposure to infective agents, infertility or recurrent abortions, and miscellaneous). The results indicate that participants' knowledge after initial counseling increased significantly and after that remained stable and sustainable. A satisfactory level of confidence among participants had been achieved, in that many felt an increased sense of control over their situation and emotional response to it. Indirectly, these results indicate the success of a team-based prenatal genetic counseling model, which has not been assessed in the literature to date.",

Guideline topics, interventions and outcomes were identified, and integrated into guideline development. Thematic analysis was used to analyse the reasons for their choices.\nRESULTS: Twenty-two priority topics were identified, with most focussed on non-pharmacological management (diet, fluid intake, physical activity, complementary medicine), pain management and psychosocial care (mental health, counselling, cognitive and behavioural training, education, support groups). They also identified 26 outcomes including quality of life (QoL), progression of kidney disease, kidney function, cyst growth and nephrotoxity. Almost all topics and outcomes suggested were identified by health professionals with the exception of five topics/outcomes. Six themes reflected reasons for their choices: clarifying ambiguities, resolving debilitating pain, concern for family, preparedness for the future, taking control and significance of impact.\nCONCLUSION: Although there was considerable concordance between the priority topics and outcomes of health professionals and consumers for guidelines of ADPKD, there was also important discordance with consumers focused on fewer issues, but particularly on lifestyle, psychosocial support, pain, and QoL and renal outcomes. Active consumer engagement in guidelines development can help to ensure the inclusion of patient-centred recommendations, which may lead to better management of disease progression, symptoms, complications, and psychosocial impact.",

The aim of this study was to assess the impact of NGS on the clinical diagnosis from imaging and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and thus the management of pancreatic cysts.\nMETHODS: Ninety-two pancreatic cyst fluids from 86 patients were analyzed by cytology, CEA, and targeted NGS. Cysts were classified by imaging as nonmucinous, mucinous, or not specified. NGS results were compared with the imaging impression stratified by CEA and cytology.\nRESULTS: NGS impacted the clinical diagnosis by defining a cyst as mucinous in 48% of cysts without elevated CEA levels. The VHL gene in 2 intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) supported a serous cystadenoma. Twenty percent of cysts that were nonmucinous by imaging were mucinous by NGS. Of the 14 not-specific cysts, CEA levels were not elevated in 12 (86%), and NGS established a mucinous etiology in 3 (25%). A KRAS or GNAS mutation supported an IPMN with nonmucinous CEA in 71%. A KRAS mutation reclassified 19% of nonneoplastic cysts with nonmucinous CEA as mucinous. Seven cyst fluids (8%) had either a TP53 mutation or loss of CDKN2A or SMAD4 in addition to KRAS and/or GNAS mutations; 5 of 7 (71%) were clinically malignant, and high-grade cytology was detected in all 5. Overall, CEA was more specific for a mucinous etiology (100%), but NGS was more sensitive (86% vs 57%).\nCONCLUSIONS: NGS of pancreatic cyst fluid impacts clinical diagnosis and patient management by defining, supporting, or changing the clinical diagnosis based on imaging and CEA. NGS was most valuable in identifying mucinous cysts with nonmucinous CEA. An added benefit is the potential to detect mutations late in the progression to malignancy that may increase the risk classification of the cyst based on imaging and cytology.",

To understand how health-care professionals address this issue in clinical practice and what interventions are used specifically to assist consultands in their communication of genetic information to appropriate relatives, we conducted a systematic review. Four electronic databases and four subject-specific journals were searched for papers published, in English, between January 1997 and May 2014. Of 2926 papers identified initially, 14 papers met the inclusion criteria for the review and were heterogeneous in design, setting and methods. Thematic data analysis has shown that dissemination of information within families is actively encouraged and supported by professionals. Three overarching themes emerged: (1) direct contact from genetic services: sending letters to relatives of mutation carriers; (2) professionals' encouragement of initially reluctant consultands to share relevant information with at-risk relatives and (3) assisting consultands in communicating genetic information to their at-risk relatives, which included as subthemes (i) psychoeducational guidance and (ii) written information aids. Findings suggest that professionals' practice and interventions are predicated on the need to proactively encourage family communication. We discuss this in the context of what guidance of consultands by professionals might be appropriate, as best practices to facilitate family communication, and of the limits to non-directiveness in genetic counselling.",

        "abstract": "Down syndrome (DS) is the most common genetic cause of intellectual and developmental disabilities in the United States with an estimated birth prevalence of 1:691 births; however, worldwide estimates of the number of individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities, including DS, remain speculative. Little is known about the global health impact of DS, such as heart defects, gastrointestinal malformations, and other medical and behavioral issues. Further research is needed to develop the next generation of novel therapies and compounds aimed at improving cognition, reducing dementia, and mitigating other manifestations of DS. To address these challenges, the National Institutes of Health has created the first web-based, voluntary registry and data resource called DS-Connect: The Down Syndrome Registry to collect demographic and health information about individuals with DS.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: A common concern of utilizing prenatal advanced genetic testing is that a result of uncertain clinical significance will increase patient anxiety. However, prenatal ultrasound may also yield findings of uncertain significance, such as 'soft markers' for fetal aneuploidy, or findings with variable prognosis, such as mild ventriculomegaly. In this study we compared risk perception following uncertain test results from each modality.\nMETHODS: A single survey with repeated measures design was administered to 133 pregnant women. It included 'intolerance of uncertainty' questions, two hypothetical scenarios involving prenatal ultrasound or advanced genetic testing, and response questions. The primary outcome was risk perception score.\nRESULTS: Risk perception did not vary significantly between ultrasound and genetic scenarios (p\u2009=\u20090.17). The genetic scenario scored a higher accuracy (p\u2009=\u20090.04) but lower sense of empowerment (p\u2009=\u20090.01). Furthermore, patients were more likely to seek additional testing after an ultrasound than after genetic testing (p\u2009=\u20090.05). There were no differences in other secondary outcomes including perception of life-altering consequences and hypothetical worry, anxiety, confusion, or medical care decisions.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that uncertain findings on prenatal genetic testing do not elicit a higher perception of risk or anxiety when compared to ultrasound findings of comparable uncertainty. \u00a9 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the diagnostic yield of comparative genomic hybridization microarrays (aCGH) and compare it with conventional karyotype analysis of standard >5-Mb resolution.\nMETHOD: A total of 1763 prenatal samples were analyzed by aCGH (CytoChip Focus Constitutional microarrays, BlueGnome, Cambridge). The diagnostic yield of chromosomal abnormalities detected by aCGH was assessed, compared with conventional karyotype analysis.\nRESULTS: The result was pathogenic/unknown penetrance in 125 cases (7.1%), and a variant of unknown significance (VOUS) was detected in 13 cases (0.7%). Out of the 125 cases with abnormal findings, 110 were also detected by conventional karyotype analysis. The aCGH increment in diagnostic yield was 0.9% (15/1763) and 1.6% when VOUS were included. Stratifying the sample according to indications for prenatal invasive testing, the highest values of diagnostic yield increment were observed for patients positive for second-trimester sonographic markers (1.5%) and for the presence of fetal structural anomalies (1.3%). In contrast, the incremental yield was marginal in patients with fetus with increased nuchal translucency (0.5%).\nCONCLUSION: The present study indicates that routine implementation of aCGH offers an incremental yield over conventional karyotype analysis, which is also present in cases with 'milder' indications, further supporting its use as a first-tier test.",

        "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Newborn screening for cystic fibrosis (CF), a chronic progressive disease affecting mucus viscosity, has been beneficial in both improving life expectancy and the quality of life for individuals with CF. In New York State from 2007 to 2012 screening for CF involved measuring immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) levels in dried blood spots from newborns using the IMMUCHEM(\u2122) Blood Spot Trypsin-MW ELISA kit. Any specimen in the top 5% IRT level underwent DNA analysis using the InPlex(\u00ae) CF Molecular Test. Of the 1.48 million newborns screened during the 6-year time period, 7631 babies were referred for follow-up. CF was confirmed in 251 cases, and 94 cases were diagnosed with CF transmembrane conductance regulated-related metabolic syndrome or possible CF. Nine reports of false negatives were made to the program. Variation in daily average IRT was observed depending on the season (4-6 ng/ml) and kit lot (<3 ng/ml), supporting the use of a floating cutoff. The screening method had a sensitivity of 96.5%, specificity of 99.6%, positive predictive value of 4.5%, and negative predictive value of 99.5%.\nCONCLUSION: Considerations for CF screening algorithms should include IRT variations resulting from age at specimen collection, sex, race/ethnicity, season, and manufacturer kit lots.\nWHAT IS KNOWN: Measuring IRT level in dried blood spots is the first-tier screen for CF. Current algorithms for CF screening lead to substantial false-positive referral rates.\nWHAT IS NEW: IRT values were affected by age of infant when specimen is collected, race/ethnicity and sex of infant, and changes in seasons and manufacturer kit lots The prevalence of CF in NYS is 1 in 4200 with the highest prevalence in White infants (1 in 2600) and the lowest in Black infants (1 in 15,400).",

The aim of the study was to identify CD in an HLA-genotyped birth cohort prospectively screened for CD.\nMETHODS: In the initial screening, 13,860 HLA-DQ-genotyped children were invited, of whom 3435/13,860 (25%) accepted participation. Of the 3435, 1620 (47%) carried DQ2 and/or DQ8, of whom 73 (4.5%) were tTGA positive assessed in radioligand-binding assays and 56 (3.5%) developed CD. At age 9 years, 13,024 children from the original cohort were re-invited to follow-up screening using the same study protocol and tTGA assays as in the first screening. Diagnosis of CD was confirmed by intestinal biopsy in children with persistent tTGA.\nRESULTS: In the follow-up screening, 1910/4077 (46.8%) carried DQ2 and/or DQ8, of whom 79/1910 (4.1%) were persistently tTGA positive and 72/1907 (3.8%) developed CD. Only 1/2167 (0.05%) child without HLA risk was IgG-tTGA positive, but did not have CD. Of the 980/1910 (51%) children carrying DQ2 and/or DQ8 who were already screened at 3 years of age, 30/979 (3.1%) were diagnosed as new patients at 9 years of age, compared with 42/928 (4.5%) children who did not participate in the initial screening (P\u200a=\u200a0.094).\nCONCLUSIONS: Screening for CD can be restricted to children carrying HLA-DQ2 and/or DQ8. Repeated screening using tTGA is necessary to identify new patients by 9 years of age. These findings may be relevant when considering implementing screening of the general population.",

Subjects either had fetal chromosome evaluation by karyotype, FISH, QF-PCR, or karyotype for newborns with suspected aneuploidy at birth. The results of targeted cfDNA analysis were compared to clinical genetic testing outcomes to assess clinical performance.\nRESULTS: Targeted cfDNA analysis with microarray quantification identified 107/108 trisomy 21 cases (99.1%), 29/30 trisomy 18 cases (96.7%), and 12/12 trisomy 13 cases (100%). The specificity was 100% for all three trisomies. Combining this data with all published clinical performance studies using DANSR/FORTE methodology for greater than 23\u2009000 pregnancies, the sensitivity of targeted cfDNA analysis was calculated to be greater than 99% for trisomy 21, 97% for trisomy 18, and 94% for trisomy 13.

WGS results were compared with results from state NBS and related follow-up testing.\nRESULTS: NBS genes are generally well covered by WGS. There is a median of one (range: 0-6) database-annotated pathogenic variant in the NBS genes per infant. Results of WGS and NBS in detecting 28 state-screened disorders and four hemoglobin traits were concordant for 88.6% of true positives (n = 35) and 98.9% of true negatives (n = 45,757). Of the five infants affected with a state-screened disorder, WGS identified two whereas NBS detected four. WGS yielded fewer false positives than NBS (0.037 vs. 0.17%) but more results of uncertain significance (0.90 vs. 0.013%).\nCONCLUSION: WGS may help rule in and rule out NBS disorders, pinpoint molecular diagnoses, and detect conditions not amenable to current NBS assays.",

        "abstract": "The aim of this paper is twofold: to analyze the genetic counseling process for breast cancer with a theoretical knowledge transfer lens and to compare generalists, medical specialists, and genetic counselors with regards to their genetic counseling practices. This paper presents the genetic counseling process occurring within a chain of value-adding activities of four main stages describing health professionals' clinical practices: (1) evaluation, (2) investigation, (3) information, and (4) decision. It also presents the results of a cross-sectional study based on a Canadian medical doctors and genetic counselors survey (n = 176) realized between July 2012 and March 2013. The statistical exercise included descriptive statistics, one-way ANOVA and post-hoc tests. The results indicate that even though all types of health professionals are involved in the entire process of genetic counseling for breast cancer, genetic counselors are more involved in the evaluation of breast cancer risk, while medical doctors are more active in the decision toward breast cancer risk management strategies. The results secondly demonstrate the relevance and the key role of genetic counselors in the care provided to women at-risk of familial breast cancer. This paper presents an integrative framework to understand the current process of genetic counseling for breast cancer in Canada, and to shed light on how and where health professionals contribute to the process. It also offers a starting point for assessing clinical practices in genetic counseling in order to establish more clearly where and to what extent efforts should be undertaken to implement future genetic services.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Diagnostic biomarkers have multiple applications along the care process and have a large potential in optimizing treatment decisions. However, many diagnostic biomarkers struggle to gain market access and obtain appropriate coverage because of a lack of evidence on their health economic impact.\nOBJECTIVES: The aim was to review the (methodological) characteristics of recent economic evaluations on diagnostic biomarkers and examine whether these studies dealt with specific issues such as different payer perspectives, preference heterogeneity, and multiple applications in subpopulations.\nMETHODS: The PubMed database and the National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database were searched. Full economic evaluations published after 2009 assessing diagnostic biomarkers for the main non-communicable diseases in middle-income or high-income countries were considered eligible. Empirical and methodological study characteristics were summarized, as was the handling of specific issues related to the economic evaluation of personalized medicine.\nRESULTS: Thirty-three economic evaluations were included, of which 25 were model-based analyses. The number of strategies compared ranged from two to 17 per study, and was especially large in studies assessing genetic testing in patients and their relatives. Cost-effectiveness results were most sensitive to test accuracy and costs of the biomarker (N\u00a0=\u00a07), the relative risk of an event (N\u00a0=\u00a04), and the proportion of people accepting genetic testing (N\u00a0=\u00a02). One study incorporated patient preferences, and none of the studies considered different payer perspectives, cost sharing arrangements or variable opportunity costs due to population density variability.\nCONCLUSIONS: Published health economic evaluations of biomarkers used for diagnosing, staging diseases, and guiding treatment selection are characterized by a large number of comparators to model the potential clinical applications and to determine their value. Assessing outcomes beyond health as well as specific issues, such as different payer perspectives and patient preferences, is crucial to fully capture the potential health economic impact of diagnostic biomarkers and to inform value-based reimbursement.",

At the time of its introduction into clinical use, perspectives of the genetic counseling community regarding ECS were unknown. We conducted a survey in early 2012 of GCs and report the results here. They represent a snapshot of opinions and usage at that time, providing a baseline for comparison as the technology continues to evolve and as usage increases. The survey assessed personal perspectives, opinions on clinical implementation and clinical utilization of ECS. The sample included 337 GCs of varying clinical fields, of whom 150 reported practicing in reproductive settings. Our findings demonstrate that, at the time, GCs indicated general agreement with ECS as a concept - for example, most GCs agreed that carrier screening should address diseases outside of current guidelines and also indicated personal interest in electing ECS. There were also disagreements or concerns expressed regarding appropriate pre- and post-test counseling (e.g., the content and delivery mode of adequate informed consent) and practical implementation (e.g., the amount of time available for follow-up care). This was the first quantitative study of a large number of GCs and it revealed initial overall support for ECS among the GC profession.

The article examines the impact of patients' socio-demographic factors on their intention to disclose genetic testing results to their relatives. Data were collected in eight genetic clinics in Israel. Patients were requested to fill in a questionnaire after counseling. A convenience sample of 564 participants who visited these clinics was collected for a response rate of 85 %. Of them, 282 participants came for susceptibility testing for hereditary cancers (cancer group), and 282 for genetic screening tests (prenatal group). In the cancer group, being secular and having more years of education correlated positively with the intention to disclose test results to relatives. In the prenatal group, being married and female correlated positively with the intention to disclose. In the cancer group, being religious and with less years of education correlated positively with the view that the clinician should deliver the results to the family. In the prenatal group, being male and unmarried correlated positively with this belief. In both groups, being of young age correlated with the perception that genetic information is private. Varied sociodemographic factors affect the intention to inform family members. Thus, knowing the social background of patients will shed light on people's attitudes to genetic information and will help clinicians provide effective counseling in discussions with patients about the implications of test results for relatives.",

There were three pregnancy terminations related to screening results of 22q11.2 deletion, two of which were confirmed as true positive by invasive testing.\nCONCLUSIONS: Clinical experience with this SNP-based non-invasive screening test for 22q11.2 deletion syndrome indicates that these deletions have a frequency of approximately 1 in 1000 in the referral population with most identifiable through this test. Use of this screening method requires the availability of counseling and other management resources for high-risk pregnancies.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Appendix 1 Statements of knowledge of correct medication use Appendix 2 Statements of self-efficacy of correct medication use Appendix 3 Statements of skills of correct medication use To characterize the experiences and feasibility of offering pharmacogenetic (PGx) testing in a community pharmacy setting.\nDESIGN: Pharmacists were invited to complete a survey about PGx testing for each patient who was offered testing. If the patient consented, pharmacists were also asked to complete a follow-up survey about the process of returning PGx testing results to patients and follow-up with the prescribing provider.\nSETTING: Community pharmacies in North Carolina from August through November 2014.\nPARTICIPANTS: Pharmacists at five community pharmacies.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patient consent for testing, time to introduce PGx testing initially and communicate results, interpretation of test results, and recommended medication changes.\nRESULTS: Of the 69 patients offered testing, 56 (81%) consented. Pre-test counseling typically lasted 1-5 minutes (81%), and most patients (55%) did not have any questions about the testing. Most pharmacists reported test results to patients by phone (84%), with discussions taking less than 1 minute (48%) or 1-5 minutes (52%). Most pharmacists believed the patients understood their results either very well (54%) or somewhat well (41%). Pharmacists correctly interpreted 47 of the 53 test results (89%). All of the incorrect interpretations were for patients with test results indicating a dosing or drug change (6/19; 32%). Pharmacists reported contacting the ordering physician for four patients to discuss results indicating a dosage or drug change.\nCONCLUSION: The provision of PGx services in a community pharmacy setting appears feasible, requiring little additional time from the pharmacist, and many patients seem interested in PGx testing. Additional training may be necessary to improve test result interpretation, as well as for communication with both patients and ordering physicians.",

Patients with low platelet reactivity (PRU<30) on prasugrel or high platelet reactivity (>208 PRU) on clopidogrel were then switched to clopidogrel and prasugrel, respectively. Our objectives were (i) to demonstrate that the proportion of \"rapid\" metabolisers on 75 mg of clopidogrel within 30-208 (PRU) of P2Y12 inhibition is non-inferior to \"slow\" metabolisers on prasugrel 10 mg and (ii) to evaluate the same end-point after switching drugs. The proportion of \"rapid\" and \"slow\" metabolisers within 30-208 PRU of P2Y12 inhibition was 71% and 56.9%, respectively, an absolute difference of +14.1% (95% CI, -0.05% to 28.28%) with a non-inferiority margin greater than the predefined margin of -10%. Among patients out of target, all but one \"slow\" metabolisers displayed low-on prasugrel platelet reactivity while the majority of \"rapid\" metabolisers (68%) displayed high-on clopidogrel platelet reactivity. After switching, the proportion of patients within 30-208 PRU of P2Y12 inhibition was 83.6% and 79.3% in \"rapid\" and \"slow\" metabolisers, respectively (+4.3%, 95% CI -7.3% to 15.9%). In conclusion, this study demonstrates a loose relationship between genotype and platelet function phenotype approaches but that they are complementary to select prasugrel or clopidogrel MD in stented ACS patients.",

Understanding the diversity of genetic markers associated with drug response across different global populations is essential to infer population rates of drug response or risk for adverse drug reactions, and to guide implementation of pharmacogenomic testing. Sri Lanka is a culturally and linguistically diverse nation, but little is known about the population genetics of the major Sri Lankan ethnic groups. The objective of this study was to investigate the diversity of pharmacogenomic variants in the major Sri Lankan ethnic groups.\nMETHODS: We examined the allelic diversity of more than 7000 variants in genes involved in drug biotransformation and response in the three major ethnic populations of Sri Lanka (Sinhalese, Sri Lankan Tamils, and Moors), and compared them with other South Asian, South East Asian, and European populations using Wright's Fixation Index, principal component analysis, and STRUCTURE analysis.\nRESULTS: We observed overall high levels of similarity within the Sri Lankan populations (median FST=0.0034), and between Sri Lankan and other South Asian populations (median FST=0.0064). Notably, we observed substantial differentiation between Sri Lankan and European populations for important pharmacogenomic variants related to warfarin (VKORC1 rs9923231) and clopidogrel (CYP2C19 rs4986893) response.\nCONCLUSION: These data expand our understanding of the population structure of Sri Lanka, provide a resource for pharmacogenomic research, and have implications for the clinical use of genetic testing of pharmacogenomic variants in these populations.",

The objective of this study was to evaluate this approach and to identify factors influencing the uptake of genetic testing for LS. In 59 mutation carriers, 70 non carriers and 16 non-tested relatives socio-demographic characteristics, family communication regarding LS, experiences and attitudes towards the family-mediated approach and motivations for genetic testing, were assessed. The majority of all respondents (73 %) were satisfied with the family-mediated approach. Nevertheless, 59 % of the respondents experienced informing a family member and 57 % being informed by a family member as burdensome. Non-tested differed from tested respondents, in that they were younger, less closely related to the index patient and a lower proportion had children. The most important reasons for declining genetic testing were (1) anticipating problems with life insurance and mortgage, (2) being content with life as it is, and (3) not experiencing any physical complaints. In conclusion, the majority of respondents consider the current family-mediated information procedure acceptable, although the provision of information on LS by relatives may be burdensome.

A total of 154 families with at least 1 clinically diagnosed FAP patient between 1963 and 2015 were included. There were altogether 194 probands and 225 call-ups. During the follow-up period, 2639 person-years with 92 deaths among probands were observed and 3634 person-years and 30 deaths among call-ups. We report crude mortality rates and standardized mortality ratios together with descriptive statistics. We compared the survival of probands and call-ups to the population by relative survival method.\nRESULTS: The crude mortality rate among probands was 34.9 per 1000 person-years and 8.3 among call-ups. The standardized mortality ratios for call-ups was 2.47 (confidence interval, 1.69-3.46) and for probands 4.07 (confidence interval, 3.29-4.96) (P=0.014). The relative survival of probands was significantly lower than call-ups (P=0.0018), and 20-year relative survival for call-ups was 94% (88% to 100%). Over two thirds of all deaths were FAP related.\nCONCLUSIONS: Survival of screened family members of FAP patients is comparable to the general population within 20 years after diagnosis. Therefore, participation in surveillance should not be delayed when a family member with FAP has been detected.",

For each sample, the IONA software generated a likelihood ratio and a maternal age-adjusted probability risk score for trisomies 21, 18 and 13. All results from the IONA test were compared against accepted diagnostic karyotyping.\nRESULTS: A total of 442 maternal samples were obtained, of which 437 had test results available for analysis and assessment of clinical accuracy. The IONA test had a detection rate of 100% for trisomies 21 (n = 43; 95% CI, 87.98-100%), 18 (n = 10; 95% CI, 58.72-100%) and 13 (n = 5; 95% CI, 35.88-100%) with cut-offs applied to likelihood ratio (cut-off > 1 considered high risk for trisomy) and probability risk score incorporating adjustment for maternal age (cut-off \u2265 1/150 considered high risk for trisomy). The false-positive rate (FPR) was 0% for trisomies 18 and 13 with both analysis outputs. For trisomy 21, a FPR of 0.3% was observed for the likelihood ratio, but became 0% with adjustment for maternal age.\nCONCLUSION: This study indicates that the IONA test is suitable for trisomy screening in a high-risk screening population. The result-interpretation feature of the IONA software should facilitate wider implementation, particularly in local laboratories, and should be a useful addition to the current screening methods for trisomies 21, 18 and 13.",

Existing models of disclosure decision making presume self-interested motives, such as seeking social support, instead of other-interested motives, like familial obligation. This study investigated young adults' (N = 173) motives to share a genetic-based health condition, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, after reading a hypothetical vignette. Results show that social support and familial obligation were both reported as motives for disclosure. In fact, some participants reported familial obligation as their primary motivator for disclosure. Finally, stronger familial obligation predicted increased likelihood of disclosing hypothetical genetic test results.

We observed a close to doubled risk of ESCC associated with a positive family history of esophageal cancer among first degree relatives (odds ratio [OR]\u2009=\u20091.85, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.42-2.41), after adjusting age, sex, family size and other confounders. The excess risks of ESCC increased with the increasing of first-degree relatives affected by esophageal cancer (p\u2009<\u20090.001). In particular, those individuals whose both parents with esophageal cancer had an 8-fold excess risk of ESCC (95%\u2009CI: 1.74-36.32). The reconstructed cohort analysis showed that the cumulative risk of esophageal cancer to age 75 was 12.2% in the first-degree relatives of cases and 7.0% in those of controls (hazard ratio\u2009=\u20091.91, 95%\u2009CI: 1.54-2.37).

        "abstract": "Fabry disease is an inherited X-linked disorder that presents during childhood in male and female patients. Young patients may initially experience pain, hypohidrosis, and gastrointestinal symptoms. Other manifestations of Fabry disease, such as renal and cardiac disease, manifest later in adolescence or adulthood. In the pediatric population, renal damage is typically subclinical and identifiable only through biopsy. Specialists from the United States with expertise in Fabry disease convened during 2013-2014 in order to develop these consensus guidelines about the management and treatment of children with Fabry disease. The presence of symptoms in boys and girls of any age is an indication to begin therapy. Early treatment before the onset of potentially irreversible vital organ pathology is ideal. Asymptomatic children with Fabry mutations should be followed closely for the development of renal, cardiac, neurological, or gastrointestinal signs, symptoms, or laboratory changes, which would warrant treatment initiation. A comprehensive care plan should be implemented by the treating physicians to guide the management of children with Fabry disease.",

Specifically, a majority of participants expressed some degree of uncertainty regarding the purpose of genetic tests and information these tests provide, rarely discussed genetic testing with others in their social networks, and expressed concerns about the misuse of and possible adverse emotional responses to genetic information. However, participants also expressed high levels of interest in receiving a skin cancer genetic test in response to the vignette and believed that receiving actionable health information was a primary reason to consider testing. Gender-based differences in perceived barriers to testing emerged.\nCONCLUSIONS: The results highlight beliefs and barriers that future interventions could target to help ensure that Latinos have adequate understanding of and access to genomic medicine advances.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In early 2015 the National Institutes of Health launched a new, national Precision Medicine Initiative with the primary goal of rapidly improving the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of cancers. The first-stage emphasis on oncology presents unique opportunities for clinical oncology to influence how the ethical challenges of precision medicine are to be articulated and addressed. Thus, a review of recent developments in connection with the Initiative, in particular on core ethics issues in clinical genomics, is a useful starting point.\nRECENT FINDINGS: Unique ethical issues arise in precision medicine because of the enormous amounts of data generated by clinical whole-genome or whole-exome sequencing and the extent of current uncertainties with respect to data interpretations and disease associations. Among the most ethically challenging issues for clinicians are complicated informed consent processes, returning results - particularly secondary and incidental findings-and privacy and confidentiality.\nSUMMARY: The first tests of precision medicine ethics in practice will be in clinical oncology, providing a rare opportunity to shape the agenda and integrate practical ethics considerations. These efforts can benefit from pre-existing research ethics analyses and recommendations from clinical and translational genetics research.",

Compared with the Western developed countries, genetic testing and risk assessment for HBOC in Asia are less available, thus prohibiting the appropriate surveillance, clinical strategies and cancer management.\nMETHODS: The current status of HBOC management in 14 Asian countries, including genetic counselling/testing uptakes and clinical management options, was reviewed. We analysed how economic factors, healthcare and legal frameworks, and cultural issues affect the genetic service availability in Asia.\nRESULTS: In 2012, only an estimated 4,000 breast cancer cases from 14 Asian countries have benefited from genetic services. Genetic testing costs and the absence of their adoption into national healthcare systems are the main economic barriers for approaching genetic services. Training programmes, regional accredited laboratories and healthcare professionals are not readily available in most of the studied countries. A lack of legal frameworks against genetic discrimination and a lack of public awareness of cancer risk assessment also provide challenges to HBOC management in Asia.\nCONCLUSIONS: The Asian BRCA Consortium reports the current disparities in genetic services for HBOC in Asia and urges the policy makers, healthcare sectors and researchers to address the limitations in HBOC management.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Bilateral prophylactic mastectomy (BPM) is effective in reducing the risk of breast cancer in women with a well-defined family history of breast cancer or in women with BRCA 1 or 2 mutations. Evaluating patient-reported outcomes following BPM are thus essential for evaluating success of BPM from patient's perspective. Our systematic review aimed to: (1) identify studies describing health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in patients following BPM with or without reconstruction; (2) assess the effect of BPM with or without reconstruction on HRQOL; and (3) identify predictors of HRQOL post-BPM.\nMETHODS: We performed a systematic review of literature using the PRISMA guidelines. PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Scopus and Cochrane databases were searched.\nRESULTS: The initial search resulted in 1082 studies; 22 of these studies fulfilled our inclusion criteria. Post-BPM, patients are satisfied with the outcomes and report high psychosocial well-being and positive body image. Sexual well-being and somatosensory function are most negatively affected. Vulnerability, psychological distress and preoperative cancer distress are significant negative predictors of quality of life and body image post-BPM.\nCONCLUSION: There is a paucity of high-quality data on outcomes of different HRQOL domains post-BPM. Future studies should strive to use validated and breast-specific PRO instruments for measuring HRQOL. This will facilitate shared decision-making by enabling surgeons to provide evidence-based answers to women contemplating BPM.",

        "abstract": "Individuals with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS) have an increased chance of developing a psychiatric disorder. While parents of children affected by 22q11.2DS typically receive counseling about risk for non-psychiatric health concerns, genetic counselors may be reluctant to discuss psychiatric risk. Further education of genetic counselors may be necessary to encourage discussion of psychiatric risk with these families. The goal of this project was to develop recommendations for genetic counselors to provide psychiatric risk information to families affected by 22q11.2DS. The recommendations were developed by synthesizing resources in the literature about risk communication. These recommendations were refined following an online focus group meeting with five health care professionals who were recruited for participation from 22q11.2DS clinics across the U.S.A. The focus group data revealed three themes related to discussion of psychiatric risk: 1) Stepwise approach, 2) Discussing treatment options and reducing risks, and 3) Addressing stigma. These recommendations may be used as a foundation for a future clinical protocol to encourage discussion about the risk for psychiatric illness at an earlier point in the diagnostic process for 22q11.2DS and to provide improved information, support and resources to affected families.",

After obtaining written permission from March of Dimes, the translation-back translation of the original questionnaire was performed. The content validity was assessed by a team of 12 experts. Based on a sample of 50 general practitioners and 100 subjects referred to health centers from September to November 2014 in Tabriz, Iran, test-retest reliability and inter-rater reliability were evaluated by Kappa and Intra-class Correlation Coefficient (ICC). Content validity of the Persian version of the questionnaire was confirmed according to the modified kappa value above 0.76 for all the items included in this tool. Inter-rater reliability assessment yielded a kappa value between 0.62 and 0.92 for variables with dichotomous measurement scales and ICC ranged from 0.6 to 0.9 for variables with numeric scales.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The gap between a large growing number of genetic tests and a suboptimal clinical workflow of incorporating these tests into regular clinical practice poses barriers to effective reliance on advanced genetic technologies to improve quality of healthcare. A promising solution to fill this gap is to develop an intelligent genetic test recommendation system that not only can provide a comprehensive view of genetic tests as education resources, but also can recommend the most appropriate genetic tests to patients based on clinical evidence. In this study, we developed an EHR based Genetic Testing Knowledge Base for Individualized Medicine (iGTKB).\nMETHODS: We extracted genetic testing information and patient medical records from EHR systems at Mayo Clinic. Clinical features have been semi-automatically annotated from the clinical notes by applying a Natural Language Processing (NLP) tool, MedTagger suite. To prioritize clinical features for each genetic test, we compared odds ratio across four population groups. Genetic tests, genetic disorders and clinical features with their odds ratios have been applied to establish iGTKB, which is to be integrated into the Genetic Testing Ontology (GTO).\nRESULTS: Overall, there are five genetic tests operated with sample size greater than 100 in 2013 at Mayo Clinic. A total of 1,450 patients who was tested by one of the five genetic tests have been selected. We assembled 243 clinical features from the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) for these five genetic tests. There are 60 clinical features with at least one mention in clinical notes of patients taking the test. Twenty-eight clinical features with high odds ratio (greater than 1) have been selected as dominant features and deposited into iGTKB with their associated information about genetic tests and genetic disorders.\nCONCLUSIONS: In this study, we developed an EHR based genetic testing knowledge base, iGTKB. iGTKB will be integrated into the GTO by providing relevant clinical evidence, and ultimately to support development of genetic testing recommendation system, iGenetics.",

We wished to support primary care doctors within the Medway Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) to implement NICE guidance (CG71) and consider the possibility of FH in adults who have raised total cholesterol concentrations, thereby improving the detection of people with FH.\nMETHODS: Utilizing clinical decision support software (Audit+) we developed an FH Audit Tool and implemented a systematic audit of electronic medical records within GP practices, first identifying all patients diagnosed with FH or possible FH and next electronically flagging patients with a recorded total cholesterol of >7.5\u2009mmol\u2009L(-1) or LDL-C\u2009>\u20094.9\u2009mmol\u2009L(-1) (in adults), for further assessment. After a 2-year period, a nurse-led clinic was introduced to screen more intensely for new FH index cases. We evaluated if these interventions increased the prevalence of FH closer to the expected prevalence from epidemiological studies.\nRESULTS: The baseline prevalence of FH within Medway CCG was 0.13% (1 in 750 persons). After 2 years, the recorded prevalence of diagnosed FH increased by 0.09% to 0.22% (1 in 450 persons). The nurse advisor programme ran for 9 months (October 2013-July 2014) and during this time, the recorded prevalence of patients diagnosed with FH increased to 0.28% (1 in 357 persons) and the prevalence of patients 'at risk and unscreened' reduced from 0.58% to 0.14%.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that two simple interventions increased the detection of FH. This systematic yet simple electronic case-finding programme with nurse-led review allowed the identification of new index cases, more than doubling the recorded prevalence of detected disease to 1 in 357 (0.28%). This study shows that primary care has an important role in identifying patients with this condition.",

We compared observed frequencies to those expected assuming Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). Significant deviations were identified by an exact test. The fixation index FIS was calculated to assess excess homozygosity. We compared newborn estimates corrected and uncorrected for HWE deviations using demographic data.\nRESULTS: Sixty samples reported genotype counts for hemoglobin variants in Africa and the Middle East. Observed and expected counts matched in 27%. The observed number of sickle cell anemia (SCA) individuals was higher than expected in 42 samples, reaching significance (P < 0.05) in 24. High FIS values were common across the study regions. The estimated total number of newborns with SCA, corrected based on FIS, was 33,261 annual births instead of 24,958 for the 38 samples across sub-Saharan Africa and 1,109 annual births instead of 578 for 12 samples from the Middle East.\nCONCLUSION: Differences between observed and expected genotype frequencies are common in surveys of hemoglobin variants in the study regions. Further research is required to identify and quantify factors responsible for such deviations. Estimates based on HWE might substantially underestimate the annual number of SCA-affected newborns (up to one-third in sub-Saharan Africa and one-half in the Middle East).",

Articles were summarized in five categories according to their focus on (1) knowledge of, attitude toward use of, and perception of DTC-GT (n=37), (2) the impact of genetic risk information on users (n=37), (3) the opinion of health professionals (n=20), (4) the content of websites selling DTC-GT (n=16), and (5) the scientific evidence and clinical utility of the tests (n=14). Most of the articles analyzed the attitude, knowledge, and perception of DTC-GT, highlighting an interest in using DTC-GT, along with the need for a health care professional to help interpret the results. The articles investigating the content analysis of the websites selling these tests are in agreement that the information provided by the companies about genetic testing is not completely comprehensive for the consumer. Given that risk information can modify consumers' health behavior, there are surprisingly few studies carried out on actual consumers and they do not confirm the overall concerns on the possible impact of DTC-GT. Data from studies that investigate the quality of the tests offered confirm that they are not informative, have little predictive power, and do not measure genetic risk appropriately.\nCONCLUSIONS: The impact of DTC-GT on consumers' health perceptions and behaviors is an emerging concern. However, negative effects on consumers or health benefits have yet to be observed. Nevertheless, since the online market of DTC-GT is expected to grow, it is important to remain aware of a possible impact.",

Early recognition of the disease in a vulnerable population such as in children aged <5 years and adults aged >60 years enhances our preparedness for any eventualities and future burden of the diseases to society. It is also recognized that current public health practices alone cannot bring about the desired outcome. When tackling public health-related issues, such problems must be recognized and state-of-the-art principles and innovations from genomic sciences, information technologies, and medical specialties must be encompassed and embraced. These will enhance strategies for preparedness and provide us with a better understanding of how to identify, manage, and control disease burdens. The ever expanding landscape of genomics research also includes experimental and computational approaches for effectively utilizing DNA sequence information. From these perspectives, the intricacies of Mendelian single gene disorders are the least challenging compared to intricacies of multi-dimensional host factors for infectious diseases or complex disorders such as cancer. The concepts of public health in India are on firm footing; however, integration of contemporary advances to implement public health principles into practice has neither been attempted nor impacted on disease burden or our preparedness to prevent eventualities.

Principles of personalized medicine remain to be fully understood and practiced despite the pharmacogenomics-based future of drug development, and treatment has not been as exciting as the advances in genomics we are witnessing today.

        "title": "Implementation of In Vitro Drug Resistance Assays: Maximizing the Potential for Uncovering Clinically Relevant Resistance Mechanisms.",
        "abstract": "Although targeted therapies are initially effective, resistance inevitably emerges. Several methods, such as genetic analysis of resistant clinical specimens, have been applied to uncover these resistance mechanisms to facilitate follow-up care. Although these approaches have led to clinically relevant discoveries, difficulties in attaining the relevant patient material or in deconvoluting the genomic data collected from these specimens have severely hampered the path towards a cure. To this end, we here describe a tool for expeditious discovery that may guide improvement in first-line therapies and alternative clinical management strategies. By coupling preclinical in vitro or in vivo drug selection with next-generation sequencing, it is possible to identify genomic structural variations and/or gene expression alterations that may serve as functional drivers of resistance. This approach facilitates the spontaneous emergence of alterations, enhancing the probability that these mechanisms may be observed in the patients. In this protocol we provide guidelines to maximize the potential for uncovering single nucleotide variants that drive resistance using adherent lines.",

        "abstract": "This article reviews international privacy norms governing human genomic biobanks and databases, and how they address issues related to consent, secondary use, de- identification, access, security, and governance. A range of international instruments were identified, varying in substance - e.g., human rights, data protection, research ethics, biobanks, and genetics - and legal character. Some norms detail processes for broad consent, namely, that even where potential participants cannot consent to specific users and uses, they should be given clear information on access policies, procedures, and governance structures. Some also give guidance about the conditions under which secondary use of data and samples without consent is appropriate, e.g., where consent is impracticable. International norms exhibit a confusing range of terminology relating to de-identification. They also continue to rely heavily on consent and anonymity as the basis for privacy protection, though governance is becoming more prominent. It may not be fatal that such a plurality of norms apply to biobanking; what is essential is that governance be built on shared values, our common interest in the success of genomic research, and practical tools that incentivize responsible, global sharing.",

        "abstract": "In genomics research, it is becoming common practice to return individualized primary and incidental findings to participants and several ongoing major studies have begun to automatically transfer these results to a participant's clinical medical record. This paper explores who should decide whether to place genomic research findings into a clinical medical record. Should participants make this decision, or does a researcher's duty to place this information in a medical record override the participant's autonomy? We argue that there are no clear ethical, legal, professional, or regulatory duties that mandate placement without the consent of the participant. We conclude that informing participants of results, together with a clear explanation, relevant recommendations and referral sources, and the option to consent to placement in the medical records will best discharge researchers' ethical and legal duties towards participants.",

        "title": "BRAF Mutation Testing and Metastatic Colorectal Cancer in the Community Setting: Is There an Urgent Need for More Education?",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) with BRAF mutation (BRAF MT) generally have a poorer prognosis. BRAF MT may also have implications for treatment strategy. Despite this, inclusion of BRAF in routine molecular testing varies. Here we report the frequency of BRAF reporting in the South Australian (SA) mCRC registry reflecting community practice, together with the survival outcomes based on mutation status.\nMETHODS: The SA population-based mCRC registry was analysed to assess the number of patients where a BRAF MT result was available. The patient characteristics are reported and overall survival was analysed using the Kaplan-Meier method.\nRESULTS: Of the 3639 patients who have been entered in the registry, only 6.2% (227) have BRAF MT results available. Of the patients tested, the BRAF MT rate is 12.7%. The mutation rate was highest in rightsided primary; right colon 23 versus left colon 8.9% and rectum 7%. There was no significant difference in median age or male/female proportion. The median overall survival (mOS) for BRAF MT versus wild-type (WT) patients is 14.0 versus 32.9 months (p = 0.003). For patients who have chemotherapy (plus or minus surgery) the mOS is 14.6 months BRAF MT versus 36.1 months (p \u2264 0.001) WT. Liver or lung resection was performed on only 8% of the BRAF MT group versus 26.5% of the WT group.\nCONCLUSION: Results in a population setting confirm our understanding that BRAF MT is more frequently right sided and of lower frequency in rectal cancer. Survival is lower for patients with mCRC that have BRAF MT, regardless of the therapy. BRAF testing is currently performed infrequently in an Australian setting despite its importance as a significant prognostic factor, and the implications for alternate therapeutic approaches.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: The results of a study of variant cytochrome P-450 (CYP) alleles and associated risks of drug-drug interactions (DDIs) and altered drug metabolism are reported.\nMETHODS: The records of a pharmacogenetic testing laboratory were retrospectively analyzed to identify patients tested for polymorphisms of genes coding for five CYP isozymes important in drug metabolism (CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, and CYP3A5) over a 16-month period. Based on the results of phenotyping, the patients were categorized by expected CYP isozyme activity (e.g., normal or poor metabolizer, expresser or nonexpresser). Using proprietary Web-based software, researchers analyzed phenotyping data and medication lists submitted by patients to determine the potential for DDIs, drug-gene interactions (DGIs), and drug-drug-gene interactions (DDGIs).\nRESULTS: In the mixed-race study population of more than 22,000 male and female patients (age range, 1-108 years; mean, 60 years), phenotypes associated with alterations of CYP metabolic pathways were common. Among patients in whom phenotypes for all five isozymes of interest were determined (n = 14,578), about 93% were not categorized as normal metabolizers of all five proteins. In many cases, potential interaction threats were rated by clinicians as severe enough to warrant implementation or consideration of a medication regimen change or dose adjustment. Analysis of patient-provided medication lists indicated frequent use of medications posing DDI, DGI, or DDGI risks.\nCONCLUSION: In a mixed-race population of over 20,000 U.S. patients, CYP gene polymorphisms associated with DDIs and other interaction threats were prevalent, and most individuals were not categorized as normal metabolizers of all five CYP isozymes of interest.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To analyze patients with kidney cancer referred for evaluation at a high-volume genetics service at a comprehensive cancer center and identify factors associated with positive tests for hereditary cancer syndromes.\nMETHODS: A retrospective review of patients referred to the Clinical Genetics Service at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center was performed, and patients with a personal history of kidney cancer were identified. Patient and disease characteristics were reviewed. In all, 4 variables including age at diagnosis of kidney tumor, presence of syndromic manifestations, family history of kidney cancer, and number of primary malignancies were evaluated for association with positive test results in 2 groups: patients tested for renal cell carcinoma syndromes and Lynch syndrome. Guidance for genetic testing strategy in patients with kidney cancer is provided.\nRESULTS: Between 1999 and 2012, 120 patients with a history of kidney cancer were evaluated by the Clinical Genetics Service. The mean age at kidney cancer diagnosis was 52 years (interquartile range: 42-63), with 57% being women. A family history of kidney cancer was reported by 39 patients (33%). Time between diagnosis of first cancer and genetic consultation was <1 year in 54%, 2 to 5 years in 23%, and>5 years in the remaining 23%. Overall, 95 patients were tested for genetic abnormalities with 27 (28%) testing positive. Testing for renal cell carcinoma (RCC)-related syndromes was performed on 43 patients, with 13 testing positive (30%). Lynch syndrome testing was positive in 9 patients (32%) after 28 were tested. In RCC-associated syndromes, young age of diagnosis was associated with positive test results. Conversely, syndromic manifestations and increasing number of primary malignancies were associated with positive Lynch testing.\nCONCLUSIONS: The discovery of inherited kidney cancer syndromes has provided a unique opportunity to identify patients at increased risk for cancer. Factors associated with positive genetic testing are unique to different syndromes. These data suggest that in kidney cancer patients evaluated for hereditary cancer syndromes, young age is associated with diagnosis of RCC syndromes, whereas syndromic manifestations and multiple primaries are found in Lynch syndrome. These results, along with clinical awareness, may be useful for practicing urologists to select patients with kidney cancer to refer for genetic counseling.",

        "title": "Statewide Retrospective Review of Familial Pancreatic Cancer in Delaware, and Frequency of Genetic Mutations in Pancreatic Cancer Kindreds.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Considering the typical rapid progression and high mortality of pancreatic cancer (PC), early detection may lead to an improved outcome. To date, there is no safe, sensitive, and cost-effective screening strategy to detect PC. Currently, screening is focused on individuals at the highest risk of developing PC based on family history. A high-risk individual is defined as having two or more first-degree relatives with PC, or one first- or second-degree relative with PC with a confirmed mutation in a gene associated with PC. The BRCA2 gene is one of the most common genes linked to pancreatic-only cancer families; however, other hereditary cancer syndromes have also been associated with an increased risk for PC.\nMETHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of pedigrees of families with a pancreatic adenocarcinoma cancer diagnosis held in the statewide Ruth Ann Minner High Risk Family Cancer Registry at the Helen F. Graham Cancer Center and Research Institute, Christiana Care Health System, Newark, DE, USA, from 2002 to 2013. The registry was queried based on how many first-, second-, or third-degree relatives of the proband were affected with PC, genetic testing status, and (if applicable) the results. These data were then categorized into families that meet familial PC (FPC) criteria, defined as two first-degree relatives with PC (FPC families), families that did not meet the FPC definition but had one first-degree relative affected with PC (first-degree families), and probands with PC (probands). Each family was counted only once in the analysis, even if multiple family members were tested.\nRESULTS: Our analysis revealed that 175 of 597 families fitting any of the above criteria completed genetic testing. Of this cohort, 52 had pathogenic alterations with nine different genes implicated. Overall, 164 of the 175 families that fitted into any of the three categories previously identified had BRCA1 or BRCA2 testing, either by DNA sequencing or next-generation sequencing via a panel test that included BRCA1/2. BRCA1 pathogenic alterations were noted in 17/164 (10.4\u00a0%) and BRCA2 pathogenic alterations were noted in 23/164 (14.0\u00a0%). FPC families (n\u00a0=\u00a046) 42/46 of the FPC families underwent BRCA1/2 testing, and 11/42 (26\u00a0% [95\u00a0% CI 12.89-39.49]) had pathogenic alterations. Specifically, 4/42\u00a0=\u00a0BRCA1 (9.5\u00a0%) and 7/42\u00a0=\u00a0BRCA2 (16.7\u00a0%). Additionally, 16/46 of the FPC families underwent exclusively Lynch syndrome (LS) testing, and pathogenic mutations in a mismatch repair protein were identified in 2/16. Specifically, 1/16\u00a0=\u00a0MLH1 (6.3\u00a0%) and 1/16\u00a0=\u00a0MSH2 (3.6\u00a0%). Overall, a genetic mutation within any gene associated with an increased PC risk was found in 28\u00a0% of FPC families. First-degree families (n\u00a0=\u00a0106) 99/106 of the families with one first-degree relative underwent BRCA1/2 testing, and 21/99 (21.2\u00a0% [95\u00a0% CI 13.16-29.27]) had pathogenic alterations. Specifically, 11/99\u00a0=\u00a0BRCA1 (11.1\u00a0%) and 10/99\u00a0=\u00a0BRCA2 (10.1\u00a0%). 32/99 first-degree families underwent exclusively LS testing, and pathogenic mutations were identified in 4/32. Specifically, 3/32\u00a0=\u00a0MLH1 (9\u00a0%) and 1/32\u00a0=\u00a0MSH6 (3\u00a0%). 25/99 of the families pursued panel testing, and pathogenic alterations in any gene were identified in 3/25. Specifically, the mutations were found in 1/25\u00a0=\u00a0ATM (4\u00a0%), 1/25\u00a0=\u00a0CHEK2 (4\u00a0%), and 1/25\u00a0=\u00a0RAD51D (4\u00a0%). Affected probands (n\u00a0=\u00a023) Lastly, all 23 probands affected with PC pursued genetic testing. Of these, 11/23 were found to have pathogenic alterations. All 23 underwent BRCA1/2 testing, and pathogenic alterations were identified in 8/23 (35\u00a0% [95\u00a0% CI 15.32-54.25]), specifically 2/23\u00a0=\u00a0BRCA1 (9\u00a0%), and 6/23\u00a0=\u00a0BRCA2 (26\u00a0%). 10/23 patients underwent panel testing and pathogenic alterations were found in 3/10 (30\u00a0%) patients, of whom 1/10\u00a0=\u00a0MSH6 (10\u00a0%), 1/10\u00a0=\u00a0ATM (10\u00a0%), and 1/10\u00a0=\u00a0TP53 (10\u00a0%).\nCONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that a statewide high-risk family cancer registry is an important instrument in studying the risk of PC in families. Our analysis revealed 14 mutations associated with FPC, among which hereditary breast and ovarian cancer and LS were most prevalent. BRCA1 was found to have the same association with PC as BRCA2, which appears unique to our population. We plan to use our knowledge of these mutations in developing a PC screening program.",

Nowadays, BRCA status may influence therapeutic decision making at cancer diagnosis. Our objective was to analyze whether the medical advances have changed the burden and pattern of referral, and the pathogenic mutation detection rate.\nMETHODS: We included 969 probands from our hereditary cancer registry who undertook a full BRCA analysis between 2006 and 2014. Chi-square tests were used to compare categorical variables.\nRESULTS: The number of genetic tests have raised from 28 to 170, representing a sixfold increase. In 2006, we tested 1.6 relatives/proband while this proportion was four in 2014. Overall, 20\u00a0% harbored a deleterious mutation and 11\u00a0% had a variant of unknown significance (VUS). There has been a downward trend in the detection rate of VUS. Testing patients with breast cancer during neoadjuvancy has raised from 4 to 25\u00a0% (p\u00a0=\u00a00.002), while testing them during remission has decreased from 79 to 29\u00a0% (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). The proportion of patients assessed during the first 6\u00a0months after their cancer diagnosis has increased from 3 to 34\u00a0% (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001). Risk reducing mastectomy and salpingoophorectomy have raised from 0 to 24\u00a0%, and from 36 to 65\u00a0%, respectively.\nCONCLUSIONS: BRCA testing has experienced a sixfold increase, the number of relatives being tested has doubled, and the test is being performed at earlier phases of the disease. It is necessary to adequate the health resources to preserve the BRCA genetic counseling quality while incorporating BRCA testing for therapeutic decision making.",

Participants were divided between those who considered variants of uncertain clinical significance helpful for parents and clinicians, and those who considered them harmful. Although recognising the potential disadvantages of disclosing risks for adult-onset conditions, participants thought it would be difficult to withhold such information once identified. Participants largely supported some parental involvement in determining which results should be returned. Most participants believed that information obtained via CMA testing in pregnancy should either be disclosed during pregnancy, or not at all.\nCONCLUSION: HCPs taking part in the study largely believed that variants that will inform the management of the pregnancy, or are relevant to other family members, should be reported. Recent UK guidelines, published after this research was completed, reflect these opinions.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The explosion in genetic technologies, including array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH), has increased the complexity of genetic counseling. We now offer chorionic villus sampling (CVS) and aCGH to all first-trimester patients, as this allows the prenatal diagnosis of an additional 1% of anomalies not otherwise detectable and can detect genetic copy number variants at a much higher resolution than conventional cytogenetics. Here, we explored some of the determinants of how patients are deciding to use or not use this new technology and evaluate risk-benefit analyses for that decision.\nMETHODS: This is a retrospective case-control study of singleton and multiples pregnancies at our center. Those having aCGH testing along with CVS were defined as 'testers' and those who declined aCGH but had the CVS were 'nontesters'.\nRESULTS: Demographic data of 181 educated women who chose CVS were compared. Among those carrying singletons (n = 144), older women, defined as over 35 years of age (or 'advanced maternal age'; AMA), were more likely to choose the aCGH than younger women. Further, women who had a prior history of genetic testing and who wanted to know the gender of the fetus were more likely to choose the aCGH test. In women carrying multiples (n = 37), AMA ceases to be a predictor of choice. Having had prior genetic counseling remains a strong predictor for choosing aCGH, as does wanting to know the gender of the fetus. Neither prior abortions nor having prior children were significant for women carrying singletons or multiples.\nCONCLUSION: Offering pregnant couples an individualized choice regarding aCGH seems an appropriate approach. There are discrete patterns associated with the choice of taking the aCGH that varied depending on whether the patient was carrying a singleton or multiples.",

The GENESIS (GENE SISter) study was designed to identify new breast cancer susceptibility genes in women attending cancer genetics clinics and with no BRCA1/2 mutation.\nMETHODS: The study involved the French national network of family cancer clinics. It was based on enrichment in genetic factors of the recruited population through case selection relying on familial criteria, but also on the consideration of environmental factors and endophenotypes like mammary density or tumor characteristics to assess potential genetic heterogeneity. One of the initial aims of GENESIS was to recruit affected sibpairs. Siblings were eligible when index cases and at least one affected sister were diagnosed with infiltrating mammary or ductal adenocarcinoma, with no BRCA1/2 mutation. In addition, unrelated controls and unaffected sisters were recruited. The enrolment of patients, their relatives and their controls, the collection of the clinical, epidemiological, familial and biological data were centralized by a coordinating center.\nRESULTS: Inclusion of participants started in February 2007 and ended in December 2013. A total of 1721 index cases, 826 affected sisters, 599 unaffected sisters and 1419 controls were included. 98% of participants completed the epidemiological questionnaire, 97% provided a blood sample, and 76% were able to provide mammograms. Index cases were on average 59 years old at inclusion, were born in 1950, and were 49.7 years of age at breast cancer diagnosis. The mean age at diagnosis of affected sisters was slightly higher (51.4 years). The representativeness of the control group was verified.\nCONCLUSIONS: The size of the study, the availability of biological specimens and the clinical data collection together with the detailed and complete epidemiological questionnaire make this a unique national resource for investigation of the missing heritability of breast cancer, by taking into account environmental and life style factors and stratifying data on endophenotypes to decrease genetic heterogeneity.",

Overall, we identified the genetic cause in 40% (21/52) of patients. The diagnostic rates of autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive and sporadic cases were 50%, 60% and 34%, respectively. When the sporadic cases with congenital and severe hearing loss were selected, the diagnostic rate rose to 48%. The combination approach using these genetic tests appears to be useful as a diagnostic tool for deafness patients. We recommended that genetic testing for the screening of common mutations in deafness genes using the Invader assay or TaqMan genotyping assay be performed as the initial evaluation. For the remaining undiagnosed cases, targeted exon sequencing using massively parallel DNA sequencing is clinically and economically beneficial.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Gene panel sequencing is revolutionizing germline risk assessment for hereditary breast cancer. Despite scant evidence supporting the role of many of these genes in breast cancer predisposition, results are often reported to families as the definitive explanation for their family history. We assessed the frequency of mutations in 18 genes included in hereditary breast cancer panels among index cases from families with breast cancer and matched population controls.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: Cases (n = 2,000) were predominantly breast cancer-affected women referred to specialized Familial Cancer Centers on the basis of a strong family history of breast cancer and BRCA1 and BRCA2 wild type. Controls (n = 1,997) were cancer-free women from the LifePool study. Sequencing data were filtered for known pathogenic or novel loss-of-function mutations.\nRESULTS: Excluding 19 mutations identified in BRCA1 and BRCA2 among the cases and controls, a total of 78 cases (3.9%) and 33 controls (1.6%) were found to carry potentially actionable mutations. A significant excess of mutations was only observed for PALB2 (26 cases, four controls) and TP53 (five cases, zero controls), whereas no mutations were identified in STK11. Among the remaining genes, loss-of-function mutations were rare, with similar frequency between cases and controls.\nCONCLUSION: The frequency of mutations in most breast cancer panel genes among individuals selected for possible hereditary breast cancer is low and, in many cases, similar or even lower than that observed among cancer-free population controls. Although multigene panels can significantly aid in cancer risk management and expedite clinical translation of new genes, they equally have the potential to provide clinical misinformation and harm at the individual level if the data are not interpreted cautiously.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Universal screening of children for dyslipidemia and other cardiovascular risk factors has been recommended. Given the clustering of cardiovascular risk factors within families, one benefit of screening adolescents may be to identify \"at-risk\" families in which adult members might also be at elevated risk and potentially benefit from medical evaluation.\nMETHODS: Cross-sectional study of grade 9 students evaluating adiposity, lipids and blood pressure. Data collected by Heart Niagara Inc. through the Healthy Heart Schools' Program. Parents completed questionnaires, evaluating family history of dyslipidemia, hypertension, diabetes and early cardiovascular disease events in parents and siblings (first-degree relatives), and grandparents (second-degree relatives). Associations between positive risk factor findings in adolescents and presence of a positive family history were assessed in logistic regression models.\nRESULTS: N\u2009=\u20094014 adolescents ages 14-15 years were screened; 3467 (86\u00a0%) provided family medical history. Amongst adolescents, 4.7\u00a0% had dyslipidemia, 9.5\u00a0% had obesity, and 3.5\u00a0% had elevated blood pressure. Central adiposity (waist-to-height ratio \u22650.5) in the adolescent was associated with increased odds of diabetes in first- (OR:2.0 (1.6-2.6), p\u2009<\u20090.001) and second-degree relatives (OR:1.3 (1.1-1.6), p\u2009=\u20090.002). Dyslipidemia was associated with increased odds of diabetes (OR:1.6 (1.1-2.3), p\u2009<\u20090.001), hypertension (OR:2.2 (1.5-3.2), p\u2009<\u20090.001) and dyslipidemia (OR:2.2 (1.5-3.2),p\u2009<\u20090.001) in first degree relatives. Elevated blood pressure did not identify increased odds of a positive family history.\nCONCLUSIONS: Presence of obesity and/or dyslipidemia in adolescents identified through a universal school-based screening program is associated with risk factor clustering within families. Universal pediatric cardiometabolic screening may be an effective entry into reverse cascade screening.",

Infantile KD symptoms include irritability, progressive stiffness, developmental delay, and death. The only potential treatment is hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. New York State (NYS) implemented newborn screening for KD in 2006.\nMETHODS: Dried blood spots from newborns were assayed for GALC enzyme activity using mass spectrometry, followed by molecular analysis for those with low activity (\u226412% of the daily mean). Infants with low enzyme activity and one or more mutations were referred for follow-up diagnostic testing and neurological examination.\nRESULTS: Of >1.9 million screened, 620 infants were subjected to molecular analysis and 348 were referred for diagnostic testing. Five had enzyme activities and mutations consistent with infantile KD and manifested clinical/neurodiagnostic abnormalities. Four underwent transplantation, two are surviving with moderate to severe handicaps, and two died from transplant-related complications. The significance of many sequence variants identified is unknown. Forty-six asymptomatic infants were found to be at moderate to high risk for disease.\nCONCLUSIONS: The positive predictive value of KD screening in NYS is 1.4% (5/346) considering confirmed infantile cases. The incidence of infantile KD in NYS is approximately 1 in 394,000, but it may be higher for later-onset forms.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Carriers of familial BRCA mutations are at high risk of early development of ovarian tubal or peritoneal cancers. The definite preventative treatment for these cases is early, risk-reducing, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO). The aims of the study were to describe the incidence and source of early occult malignancy after risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy in carriers of Ashkenazi Jewish BRCA mutations and to characterize the clinical and pathological features of this unique population.\nMETHODS: Data were collected retrospectively regarding women who underwent BSO in our gynecologic oncology unit from January 2002 through July 2012, after a positive test for a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation.\nRESULTS: The following 92 cases of BRCA mutations were included: 53 BRCA1, 37 BRCA2, and 2 with both mutations. After risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy, 5 (5.4%) of the patients were found to have early occult adnexal malignancy upon pathology study. All 5 had the BRCA1 185 del-AG mutation. Three of the 5 malignancies originated from the ovaries and 2 in the fallopian tubes with no involvement of the ovaries.\nCONCLUSIONS: A 5.4% incidence of early occult malignancy in adnexal pathology of BSO was found in carriers of Ashkenazi Jewish BRCA mutations. Two cases with malignant origins within the fallopian tube, while sparing the ovaries in their entirety, support the fallopian tubes as the originating organ for some ovarian or peritoneal malignancies in BRCA mutation carriers.",

Implementing comprehensive CFTR analysis using Sanger sequencing as a component of confirmatory testing of all screen-positive newborns has remained impractical due to relatively lengthy turnaround times and high cost. Here, we describe CFseq, a highly sensitive, specific, rapid (<3 days), and cost-effective assay for comprehensive CFTR gene analysis from dried blood spots, the common newborn screening specimen. The unique design of CFseq integrates optimized dried blood spot sample processing, a novel multiplex amplification method from as little as 1 ng of genomic DNA, and multiplex next-generation sequencing of 96 samples in a single run to detect all relevant CFTR mutation types. Sequence data analysis utilizes publicly available software supplemented by an expert-curated compendium of >2000 CFTR variants. Validation studies across 190 dried blood spots demonstrated 100% sensitivity and a positive predictive value of 100% for single-nucleotide variants and insertions and deletions and complete concordance across the polymorphic poly-TG and consecutive poly-T tracts. Additionally, we accurately detected both a known exon 2,3 deletion and a previously undetected exon 22,23 deletion. CFseq is thus able to replace all existing CFTR molecular assays with a single robust, definitive assay at significant cost and time savings and could be adapted to high-throughput screening of other inherited conditions.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Prenatal genetic analysis in primary immunodeficiency diseases (PIDs) can decrease morbidity and mortality.\nMETHODS: We compared the postnatal prognoses of index cases and their subsequent sibling-fetuses using prenatal genetic analysis.\nRESULTS: From 2007 to 2014, 14 sibling-fetuses receiving a prenatal diagnosis born to four mothers with WAS, three with X-CGD, and one each with IPEX, XLA and severe combined immunodeficiency [RAG2-SCID] were recruited. There were six affected, two carriers, and six wild types. Among the six affected, four [3X-CGD and 1RAG2-SCID] were terminated and two [1WAS and 1X-CGD] with early prophylactics underwent successful hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) without infection. In the 12 index cases with a postnatal diagnosis, eight died (five due to infections and one each due to refractory bleeding, severe diarrhea, and post-transplant pneumothorax), two X-CGD underwent reconstituted HSCT after recurrent life-threatening infections, one WAS developed malignancy, and another WAS developed autoimmune disorders despite the administration of prophylactics and regular immunoglobulin infusion.\nCONCLUSION: Instead of recurrent life-threatening infections leading to mortality in the postnatal diagnosis group, the severe PIDs who received early prophylactics were cured by HSCT, and all of mortality were terminations in the prenatal diagnosis group. Further large-scale studies are needed to validate this beneficial effect. Key message Prenatal genetic analysis in fetuses born to PIDs carrier mothers allows for the affected fetuses to receive optimal management including prophylactics against infections and HSCT if indicated. Patients with PIDs diagnosed postnatally who are prone to severe infections have higher rates of morbidity and mortality than their subsequent siblings who have a prenatal genetic diagnosis.",

Study participants included 897 women aged 40 years and younger at breast cancer diagnosis from 11 academic and community medical centers.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Frequency and trends in the use of BRCA testing and how genetic information is used to make treatment decisions among women who test positive vs negative for a BRCA mutation.\nRESULTS: A total of 780 (87.0%) of 897 women reported BRCA testing by 1 year after breast cancer diagnosis (mean age at diagnosis, 35.3 vs 36.9 years for untested women; P\u2009<\u2009.001), with the frequency of testing increasing among women diagnosed from August 1, 2006, through December 31, 2013. Of 39 women who were diagnosed as having breast cancer in 2006, 30 (76.9%) reported testing. In 2007, a slightly lower percentage of women (87 of 124 [70.2%]) reported testing; however, the proportion tested increased each subsequent year, with 141 (96.6%) of 146 and 123 (95.3%) of 129 women diagnosed as having breast cancer in 2012 and 2013, respectively, reporting BRCA testing (P\u2009<\u2009.001). Among untested women, 37 (31.6%) of 117 did not report discussion of the possibility that they might have a mutation with a physician and/or genetic counselor, and 43 (36.8%) of 117 were thinking of testing in the future. A total of 248 (29.8%) of 831 women said that knowledge or concern about genetic risk influenced treatment decisions; among these women, 76 (86.4%) of 88 mutation carriers and 82 (51.2%) of 160 noncarriers chose bilateral mastectomy (P < .001). Fewer women reported that systemic treatment decisions were influenced by genetic risk concern.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Rates of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation testing are increasing in young women with breast cancer. Given that knowledge and concern about genetic risk influence surgical decisions and may affect systemic therapy trial eligibility, all young women with breast cancer should be counseled and offered genetic testing, consistent with the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The US Preventative Service Task Force recommends that physicians perform a genetic risk assessment to identify women at risk for BRCA1/2 mutations associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) syndrome. However, outcomes data after a diagnosis of HBOC syndrome especially in diverse populations, are minimal. Here we asked if genetic screening of high-risk underserved women identified in the mammogram population reduces cancer incidence.\nMETHODS: We evaluated 61,924 underserved women at screening mammography for family histories suggestive of HBOC syndrome over the course of 21 months. Data were collected retrospectively from patients at two safety net hospitals through chart review. A computer model was used to calculate the long-term effect of this screening on cancer incidence by assessing both the mutation detection rate and the completion of prophylactic surgeries in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers.\nFINDINGS: We identified 20 of the 85 (23.5%) expected BRCA1/2 mutation carriers in the underserved population. The frequencies of prophylactic mastectomies and oophorectomies in the mutation carriers were 25% and 40%, respectively. Using these data, our model predicted only an 8.8% reduction in both breast and ovarian cancer in the underserved patients. This contrasts with a 57% reduction in breast cancer and 51% reduction in ovarian cancer in an insured reference population. Our data indicate that underserved patients with HBOC syndrome are difficult to identify and when identified are limited in their ability to adhere to NCCN guidelines for cancer prevention.\nINTERPRETATION: Screening for women at risk for HBOC syndrome in mammogram populations will only prevent cancers if we can increase compliance with management guidelines. This study provides prototypic baseline data for step-wise analysis of the efficacy of the use of family history analysis in the mammography setting for detection and management of HBOC syndrome.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although the \"right not to know\" is well established in international regulations, it has been heavily debated. Ubiquitous results from extended exome and genome analysis have challenged the right not to know. American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) Recommendations urge to inform about incidental findings that pretend to be accurate and actionable. However, ample clinical cases raise the question whether these criteria are met. Many incidental findings are of uncertain significance (IFUS). The eager to feedback information appears to enter the field of IFUS and thereby threaten the right not to know. This makes it imperative to investigate the arguments for and against a right not to know for IFUS.\nDISCUSSION: This article investigates how the various arguments for and against a right not to know hold for IFUS. The main investigated arguments are: hypothetical utilitarianism, the right-based argument, the feasibility argument, the value of knowledge argument, the argument from lost significance, the empirical argument, the duty to disclose argument, the avoiding harm argument; the argument from principle, from autonomy, from privacy, as well as the argument from the right to an open future. The analysis shows that both sides in the debate have exaggerated the importance of incidental findings. Opponents of a right not to know have exaggerated the importance of IFUS, while proponents have exaggerated the need to be protected from something that is not knowledge. Hence, to know or not to know is not the question. The question is whether we should be able to stay ignorant of incidental findings of uncertain significance, if we want to. The answer is yes: As long as the information is not accurate and/or actionable: ignorance is bliss. When answering questions that are not asked, we need to think twice.",

A decision tree model was constructed to incorporate the real-world data on AED prescription patterns, incidences of AED-induced Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS)/toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), costs of AED treatments, SJS/TEN treatment, and HLA-B*15:02 testing, and quality of life. Cost-effectiveness of the screening policy was analyzed for 3 scenarios: (1) current real-world situation, (2) \"ideal\" situation assuming full policy adherence and preferable testing practices, and (3) \"extended\" situation simulating the extension of HLA-B*15:02 screening to phenytoin in ideal practice.\nRESULTS: The current screening policy was associated with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of US $85,697 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) compared with no screening.

Its cost-effectiveness may be improved by enhancing policy adherence and by low-cost point-of-care genotyping. Extending the screening to phenytoin would not be cost-effective because of the low incidence of phenytoin-SJS/TEN among HLA-B*15:02 carriers.",

The coauthors, experts in the fields of molecular pathology, precision medicine, and pathology informatics, also contributed their experiences.\nCONCLUSIONS: -The boundary between bioinformatics and clinical informatics has significantly blurred with the introduction of NGS into clinical molecular laboratories. Next-generation sequencing technology and the data derived from these tests, if managed well in the clinical laboratory, will redefine the practice of medicine. In order to sustain this progress, adoption of smart computing technology will be essential. Computational pathologists will be expected to play a major role in rendering diagnostic and theranostic services by leveraging \"Big Data\" and modern computing tools.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Successful clinical trial accrual targeting uncommon genomic alterations will require broad national participation from both National Cancer Institute (NCI)-designated comprehensive cancer centers and community cancer programs. This report describes the initial experience with clinical trial accrual after next-generation sequencing (NGS) from three affiliated non-NCI-designated cancer programs.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinical trial participation was reviewed after enrollment of the first 200 patients undergoing comprehensive genomic profiling by NGS as part of an institutional intuitional review board-approved protocol at three affiliated hospitals in Rhode Island and was compared with published experience from NCI-designated cancer centers.\nRESULTS: Patient characteristics included a median age of 64 years, a median of two lines of prior therapy, and a predominance of GI carcinomas (58%). One hundred sixty-four of 200 patients (82%) had adequate tumor for NGS, 95% had genomic alterations identified, and 100% had variants of unknown significance. Fifteen of 164 patients (9.2%) enrolled in genotype-directed clinical trials, and three patients (1.8%) received commercially available targeted agents off clinical trials. The reasons for nonreceipt of NGS-directed therapy were no locally available matching trial (48.6%), ineligibility (33.6%) because of comorbidities or interim clinical deterioration, physician's choice of a different therapy (6.8%), or stable disease (11%).\nCONCLUSION: This experience demonstrates that a program enrolling patients in specific targeted agent clinical trials after NGS can be implemented successfully outside of the NCI-designated cancer program network, with comparable accrual rates. This is important because targetable genes have rare mutation rates and clinical trial accrual after NGS is low.",

        "abstract": "We aimed to develop a user-centered, web-based, decision support tool for breast cancer risk assessment and personalized risk management. Using a novel model choice algorithm, iPrevent(\u00ae) selects one of two validated breast cancer risk estimation models (IBIS or BOADICEA), based on risk factor data entered by the user. Resulting risk estimates are presented in simple language and graphic formats for easy comprehension. iPrevent(\u00ae) then presents risk-adapted, evidence-based, guideline-endorsed management options. Development was an iterative process with regular feedback from multidisciplinary experts and consumers. To verify iPrevent(\u00ae), risk factor data for 127 cases derived from the Australian Breast Cancer Family Study were entered into iPrevent(\u00ae), IBIS (v7.02), and BOADICEA (v3.0). Consistency of the model chosen by iPrevent(\u00ae) (i.e., IBIS or BOADICEA) with the programmed iPrevent(\u00ae) model choice algorithm was assessed. Estimated breast cancer risks from iPrevent(\u00ae) were compared with those attained directly from the chosen risk assessment model (IBIS or BOADICEA). Risk management interventions displayed by iPrevent(\u00ae) were assessed for appropriateness. Risk estimation model choice was 100 % consistent with the programmed iPrevent(\u00ae) logic. Discrepant 10-year and residual lifetime risk estimates of >1 % were found for 1 and 4 cases, respectively, none was clinically significant (maximal variation 1.4 %). Risk management interventions suggested by iPrevent(\u00ae) were 100 % appropriate. iPrevent(\u00ae) successfully integrates the IBIS and BOADICEA risk assessment models into a decision support tool that provides evidence-based, risk-adapted risk management advice. This may help to facilitate precision breast cancer prevention discussions between women and their healthcare providers.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Next-generation sequencing provides useful information about gene mutations, gene expression, epigenetic modification, microRNA expression, and copy number variations. More and more computing tools have been developed to analyze this large quantity of information. However, to test and find suitable analytical tools and integrate their results is tedious and challenging for users with little bioinformatics training. In the present study, we assembled the computing tools into a convenient toolkit to simplify the analysis and integration of data between bioinformatics tools.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: The toolkit, GeneGazer, comprises of two parts: the first, named Gaze_Profiler, was designed for personalized molecular profiling from next-generation sequencing data of paired samples; the other, named Gaze_BioSigner, was designed for the discovery of disease-associated biosignatures from expressional and mutational profiles of a cohort study.\nRESULTS: To demonstrate the capabilities of Gaze_Profiler, we analyzed a pair (colon cancer and adjacent normal tissues) of RNA-sequencing data from one patient downloaded from the Sequencing Read Archive database and used them to profile somatic mutations and digital gene expression. In this case, alterations in the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway (activated by KRAS G13D mutation) and canonical WNT signaling pathway (activated by truncated APC) were identified; no EGFR mutation or overexpression was found. These data suggested a limited efficacy of cetuximab in the patient. To demonstrate the ability of Gazer_BioSigner, we analyzed gene-expression data from 192 cancer tissues downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas and found that the activation of cAMP/PKA signaling, OCT-3/4 and SRF were associated with colon cancer progression and could be potential therapeutic targets.\nCONCLUSION: GeneGazer is a reliable and robust toolkit for the analysis of data from high-throughput platforms and has potential for clinical application and biomedical research.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Accumulating data suggest that team-based learning (TBL) is more effective than lecture-based teaching strategies. Educational sessions at national meetings, however, tend to be lecture-based, and unlike most examples of TBL, involve participants who do not know each other or the instructor.\nOBJECTIVE: We evaluated a 1-day TBL genomic pathology workshop for residents held at 3 national meetings.\nMETHODS: A committee of experts developed the workshop. Prior to attending, participants were provided access to readings and asked to answer preparation questions. Each of the 4 modules within the workshop consisted of a 60-minute TBL activity flanked by 15- to 30-minute preactivity and postactivity lectures. We used surveys to acquire participant evaluation of the workshop.\nRESULTS: From 2013-2014, 86 pathology residents from 61 programs participated in 3 workshops at national meetings. All workshops were well received, with over 90% of attendees indicating that they would recommend them to other residents and that the material would help them as practicing pathologists. An incremental approach facilitated decreasing faculty presence at the workshops: the first 2 workshops had 7 faculty each (1 facilitator for each team and 1 circulating faculty member), while the final workshop involved only 2 faculty for 6 teams. For this final session, participants agreed that circulating faculty provided adequate support. Participant \"buy-in\" (requiring completion of a preworkshop survey) was critical in enabling a TBL approach.\nCONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that TBL is a feasible and effective strategy for teaching genomic medicine that is acceptable to pathology residents at national meetings.",

        "abstract": "Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) is one of the most severe and fatal forms of inherited primary immunodeficiency. Early diagnosis of SCID improves the outcome of life before and after hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). SCID fulfills the internationally-established criteria for a condition to be screened for at birth. T cell receptor excision circle (TREC) assay is commonly used in western countries as part of newborn blood spot screening (NBS) program as the assay has high sensitivity and specificity to identify SCID infants, allowing early intervention and curative bone marrow (BM) transplantation. In India, the blood spot based screening programs are yet to mature into a full-fledged national program. Moreover, TREC assay, a PCR based test, is not widely available and may cost USD 5-7 per test; thus limiting its applicability for screening newborns in Indian scenario. Most of the SCID patients have lymphopenia at birth and routine evaluation for absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) on cord blood samples can help in pre-symptomatic detection and early intervention for neonates with SCID. Although ALC count lacks the sensitivity and specificity of TREC assay; its lower cost and widespread availability makes it an attractive option for identifying newborns with lymphopenia during the post-partum hospital stay. BCG vaccine and other live attenuated vaccines (e.g., oral polio vaccine) should be withheld in lymphopenic infants until SCID is excluded by clinical and/or immunological work-up. A diagnosis of SCID warrants immediate care to prevent and treat infections and wherever feasible, early stem cell transplantation for disease free survival.",

Participants were asked with whom they had discussed their results. Genetic reports were linked to survey responses.\nRESULTS: Among 1026 respondents, 63% planned to share their results with a PCP. At 6-month follow-up, 27% reported having done so, and 8% reported sharing with another health care provider only. Common reasons for not sharing results with a health care provider were that the results were not important enough (40%) or that the participant did not have time to do so (37%). Among participants who discussed results with their PCP, 35% were very satisfied with the encounter, and 18% were not at all satisfied. Frequently identified themes in participant descriptions of these encounters were actionability of the results or use in care (32%), PCP engagement or interest (25%), and lack of PCP engagement or interest (22%).\nLIMITATION: Participants may not be representative of all DTC PGT consumers.\nCONCLUSION: A comprehensive picture of DTC PGT consumers who shared their results with a health care provider is presented. The proportion that shares results is expected to increase with time after testing as consumers find opportunities for discussion at later appointments or if results become relevant as medical needs evolve.\nPRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE: National Institutes of Health.",

Given that the development of lung cancer screening programs will face many of the same issues that have challenged other cancer screening programs, the National Cancer Institute-funded Population-based Research Optimizing Screening through Personalized Regimens (PROSPR) consortium was used to identify lessons learned from the implementation of breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer screening that should inform the introduction of lung cancer screening. These lessons include the importance of developing systems for identifying and recruiting eligible individuals in primary care, ensuring that screening centers are qualified and performance is monitored, creating clear communication standards for reporting screening results to referring physicians and patients, ensuring follow-up is available for individuals with abnormal test results, avoiding overscreening, remembering primary prevention, and leveraging advances in cancer genetics and immunology. Overall, this experience emphasizes that effective cancer screening is a multistep activity that requires robust strategies to initiate, report, follow up, and track each step as well as a dynamic and ongoing oversight process to revise current screening practices as new evidence regarding screening is created, new screening technologies are developed, new biological markers are identified, and new approaches to health care delivery are disseminated.

Multivariable logistic regression modeling was carried out to determine the relationship between predictors and outcomes. 215 physicians participated to the survey. The majority were medical oncologists (88%), practicing in Europe (70%) and working in academic institutions (66%). Tumor genome sequencing was requested by 82 participants (38%), of whom 21% reported low confidence in their genomic knowledge, and 56% considered tumor genome sequencing to be poorly accessible.

Expanded carrier screening (ECS) now allows for determining carrier status for hundreds of genetic mutations by using a single sample, and some recommend ECS prior to in vitro fertilization. This study seeks to evaluate how often ECS alters clinical management when patients present for infertility care.\nMETHODS: All patients tested with ECS at a single infertility care center from 2011 to 2014 were evaluated. The overall rate of positive ECS results and the number of couples who were carriers of the same genetic disorder were evaluated.\nRESULTS: A total of 6,643 individuals were tested, representing 3,738 couples; 1,666 (25.1%) of the individuals had a positive test result for at least one disorder. In 8 of the 3,738 couples, both members of the couple were positive for the same genetic disorder or had a test result that placed them at risk of having an affected child. Three of eight cases were cystic fibrosis. In this cohort, ECS affected clinical care eight times after 6,643 tests (0.12%, confidence interval: 0.05-0.24%) in 3,738 couples (0.21%, confidence interval: 0.09-0.42%).\nCONCLUSIONS: ECS is becoming more widespread.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Congenital heart disease (CHD) occurs in approximately 1% of all live births, and 3% to 8% of these have until now been considered familial cases, defined as the occurrence of two or more affected individuals in a family. The validity of CHD diagnoses in Danish administrative registry data has only been studied previously in highly selected patient populations. These studies identified high positive predictive values (PPVs) and recurrence risk ratios (RRRs-ratio between probabilities of CHD given family history of CHD and no family history). However, the RRR can be distorted if registry data are used indiscriminately. Here, we investigated the consequences of misclassifications for the RRR using validated diagnoses on Danish patients with familial CHD.\nMETHODS: Danish citizens are assigned a civil registration number (CPR number) at birth or immigration, which acts as a unique identifier in the Danish registries, thus enabling connection of information from several registries. Utilizing the CPR number, we identified Danish patients with familial CHD and reviewed each patient's file. We compared diagnoses from the registries with those manually assigned, which enabled calculation of the PPVs of diagnoses in the Danish registries, and from this, we deduced the false discovery rate (FDR). To measure the consequences on the RRR, the FDR was applied to a simulated data set with true RRR values of 2 and 10.\nRESULTS: We validated diagnoses of 2,442 patients from 1,593 families. Of these, 874 patients were misclassified corresponding to an FDR of 36%. Applying this FDR on the simulated data sets, we found that the RRR decreased from 2 and 10 to 1.4 and 5.1, respectively. Lastly, we estimated that 11% of all cases with CHD were familial.\nCONCLUSION: We found that approximately one of nine of all cases with CHD are familial, and we also found that 36% of individuals with CHD in administrative medical registries are misclassified, which distort the RRR in simulated scenarios.",

        "abstract": "Delivering genetic test results to clinicians is a complex process. It involves many actors and multiple steps, requiring all of these to work together in order to create an optimal course of treatment for the patient. We used information gained from focus groups in order to illustrate the current process of delivering genetic test results to clinicians. We propose a business process model and notation (BPMN) representation of this process for a Translational Pharmacogenomics Project being implemented at the University of Maryland Medical Center, so that personalized medicine program implementers can identify areas to improve genetic testing processes. We found that the current process could be improved to reduce input errors, better inform and notify clinicians about the implications of certain genetic tests, and make results more easily understood. We demonstrate our use of BPMN to improve this important clinical process for CYP2C19 genetic testing in patients undergoing invasive treatment of coronary heart disease.",

We documented the percentage of patients with HeFH and/or CVD who met FDA and insurance criteria for PCSK9 inhibitor therapy using LDLC goal-based guidelines.\nRESULTS: Of 734 patients with LDLC \u2265 70 mg/dl after \u2265 2 months maximally tolerated LDLC lowering therapy, 220 (30%) had HeFH and/or CVD with LDLC > 100 mg/dl, meeting FDA-insurance criteria for PCSK9 inhibitor therapy. Another 66 (9%) patients were statin intolerant, without HeFH or CVD. Of the 50 patients whose PCSK9 inhibitor therapy was approved for insurance coverage, 45 (90%) had LDLC > 100 mg/dl after \u2265 2 months on maximally tolerated LDLC lowering therapy. Seventeen of these 50 patients (34%) had HeFH without CVD (LDLC on treatment 180 \u00b1 50 mg/dl), 15 (30%) had CVD without HeFH (LDLC on treatment 124 \u00b1 26 mg/dl), 14 (28%) had both HeFH and CVD (LDLC on treatment 190 \u00b1 53 mg/dl), and 4 (8%) had neither HeFH nor CVD (LCLC 142 \u00b1 11 mg/dl).\nCONCLUSION: Of 734 patients referred for LDLC reduction, with LDLC \u2265 70 mg/dl after \u2265 2 months on maximally tolerated therapy, 220 (30%) had HeFH and/or CVD with LDLC > 100 mg/dl, meeting FDA-insurance criteria for PCSK9 inhibitor therapy as an adjunct to diet-maximally tolerated cholesterol lowering therapy in HeFH or CVD. If 30% of patients with high LDLC and HeFH-CVD are eligible for PCSK9 inhibitors, then specialty pharmaceutical pricing models (~$14,300/year) will collide with tens of millions of HeFH-CVD patients. We speculate that if there was a 50 % reduction in CVD, then there would be savings of $245 billion, in the middle of the range of estimated PCSK9 inhibitor costs of $185-342 billion. Whether the health care savings arising from the anticipated reduction of CVD events by PCSK9 inhibitors justify their extraordinary costs in broad population use remains to be determined.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Lynch syndrome is an inherited disorder associated with a range of cancers, and found in 2-5\u00a0% of colorectal cancers. Lynch syndrome is diagnosed through a combination of significant family and clinical history and pathology. The definitive diagnostic germline test requires formal patient consent after genetic counselling. If diagnosed early, carriers of Lynch syndrome can undergo increased surveillance for cancers, which in turn can prevent late stage cancers, optimise treatment and decrease mortality for themselves and their relatives. However, over the past decade, international studies have reported that only a small proportion of individuals with suspected Lynch syndrome were referred for genetic consultation and possible genetic testing. The aim of this project is to use behaviour change theory and implementation science approaches to increase the number and speed of healthcare professional referrals of colorectal cancer patients with a high-likelihood risk of Lynch syndrome to appropriate genetic counselling services.\nMETHODS: The six-step Theoretical Domains Framework Implementation (TDFI) approach will be used at two large, metropolitan hospitals treating colorectal cancer patients. Steps are: 1) form local multidisciplinary teams to map current referral processes; 2) identify target behaviours that may lead to increased referrals using discussion supported by a retrospective audit; 3) identify barriers to those behaviours using the validated Influences on Patient Safety Behaviours Questionnaire and TDFI guided focus groups; 4) co-design interventions to address barriers using focus groups; 5) co-implement interventions; and 6) evaluate intervention impact. Chi square analysis will be used to test the difference in the proportion of high-likelihood risk Lynch syndrome patients being referred for genetic testing before and after intervention implementation. A paired t-test will be used to assess the mean time from the pathology test results to referral for high-likelihood Lynch syndrome patients pre-post intervention. Run charts will be used to continuously monitor change in referrals over time, based on scheduled monthly audits.\nDISCUSSION: This project is based on a tested and refined implementation strategy (TDFI approach). Enhancing the process of identifying and referring people at high-likelihood risk of Lynch syndrome for genetic counselling will improve outcomes for patients and their relatives, and potentially save public money.",

About 295,000 cytogenetic, 35,000 immunogenetic and 263,000 molecular genetic analyses of 902 genes were recorded. Seventy-four percent of the services were accredited with institutional bodies and 57\u00a0% were also certified according to ISO 9001 standard.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify how physicians develop their knowledge base and practice patterns regarding noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT).\nMETHODS: A survey was used to assess physicians' informational sources and practice patterns regarding NIPT.\nRESULTS: While most of the 258 participants acquire knowledge about NIPT from the medical literature or didactic educational programming, 74 (28.7%) cite commercial laboratories as an initial source and 124 (47.8%) as a way to keep current with changes in NIPT. About one-third (n\u2009=\u200994, 36.4%) seek information about ethical issues related to NIPT. Half of the OB/GYN respondents (n\u2009=\u2009136, 52.7%) provide pretest counseling; fewer refer to a genetic counselor or maternal fetal medicine specialist (MFM) (n\u2009=\u200994, 34.6%, n\u2009=\u200929, 11.2%, respectively).

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Genetic anticipation, the earlier onset of disease in successive generations, has been reported in hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome (HBOC), but little is known about its underlying mechanisms. Ascertainment bias has been suggested as a reason in previous studies. Likewise, cohort effect, which may be caused by environmental factors, can be misinterpreted as genetic anticipation.\nMETHODS: The authors reviewed the pedigrees of 176 kindreds, segregating those with deleterious mutations in breast cancer genes 1 and 2 (BRCA1/BRCA2) who had at least 2 consecutive generations of the same cancer (breast or ovarian). By using mutation probabilities as analytical weights in weighted random-effect models, generational differences in the age at onset of breast/ovarian cancer were calculated. The analyses were further controlled for ascertainment bias by excluding probands and adjusting for birth-cohort effect in the anticipation models.\nRESULTS: The mean age at the onset of breast cancer for the probands' generation was 41.9 years, which was 6.8 years and 9.8 years earlier than the parents' and grandparents' generations, respectively. The anticipation effect for breast cancer remained significant after excluding the probands. There was a birth-cohort effect: patients who were born in 1930s and 1940s had breast cancer 5.0 years and 7.6 years earlier than patients who were born before 1920. The difference in breast cancer age of onset across generations was no longer significant after adjusting for birth-cohort effect.\nCONCLUSIONS: The observed anticipation effect was driven mainly by a decrease in age of onset across birth cohorts, underscoring the need for risk-reducing interventions that target changing environmental/lifestyle factors in BRCA1/BRCA2 carriers.

        "abstract": "With the approval of olaparib as monotherapy treatment in platinum-sensitive, relapsed high-grade serous ovarian cancer by the European Medical Agency (EMA), comprehensive genotyping of BRCA1 and BRCA2 in tumor tissue has become a mandatory pre-therapeutic test. This requires significant advances in routine tumor test methodologies due to the large size of both genes and the lack of mutational hot spots. Classical focused screening approaches, like Sanger sequencing, do not allow for a sensitive, rapid, and economic analysis of tumor tissue. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) approaches employing targeted panels for BRCA1/2 to interrogate formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tumor samples from either surgical resection or biopsy specimens can overcome these limitations. Although focused NGS methods have been implemented by few centers in routine molecular diagnostics for the analysis of some druggable oncogenic mutations, the reliable diagnostic testing of the entire coding regions of BRCA1 and BRCA2 was a new challenge requiring extensive technological improvement and quality management. Here, we describe the implementation and results of the first round robin trial for BRCA1/2 mutation testing in tumor tissue that was conducted in central Europe on May 2015, shortly after the approval and prior to the official release of olaparib. The high success rate of 81\u00a0% (21/26 test centers) demonstrates that BRCA1/2 multicenter mutation testing is well feasible in FFPE tumor tissue, extending to other tumor entities beyond ovarian cancer. The high number of test centers passing the trial demonstrates the success of the concerted efforts by German, Swiss, and Austrian pathology centers to ensure quality-controlled NGS-based testing and proves the potential of this technology in routine molecular pathology. On the basis of our results, we provide recommendations for predictive testing of tumor tissue for BRCA1/2 to clinical decision making in ovarian cancer patients.",

        "abstract": "Prostate cancer (PCa) testing is recommended by most authoritative groups for high-risk men including those with a family history of the disease. However, family history information is often limited by patient knowledge and clinician intake, and thus, many men are incorrectly assigned to different risk groups. Alternate methods to assess PCa risk are required. In this review, we discuss how genetic variants, referred to as PCa-risk single-nucleotide polymorphisms, can be used to calculate a genetic risk score (GRS). GRS assigns a relatively unique value to all men based on the number of PCa-risk SNPs that an individual carries. This GRS value can provide a more precise estimate of a man's PCa risk. This is particularly relevant in situations when an individual is unaware of his family history. In addition, GRS has utility and can provide a more precise estimate of risk even among men with a positive family history. It can even distinguish risk among relatives with the same degree of family relationships. Taken together, this review serves to provide support for the clinical utility of GRS as an independent test to provide supplemental information to family history. As such, GRS can serve as a platform to help guide-shared decision-making processes regarding the timing and frequency of PCa testing and biopsies.",

        "abstract": "STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort.\nOBJECTIVE: To determine whether a genetic test is associated with successful Providence bracing for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS).\nSUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Genetic factors have been defined that predict the risk of progression of AIS in a polygenic fashion. From these data, a commercially available genetic test, ScoliScore, was developed. It is now used in clinical practice for counseling and to guide clinical management. Bracing is a mainstay of treatment for AIS. Large efforts have been made recently to reduce potential confounding across studies of different braces; however, none of these have considered genetics as a potential confounder. In particular, ScoliScore has not been evaluated in a population undergoing bracing.\nMETHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study in which we identified a population of AIS patients who were initiated with Providence bracing and followed over time. Although these patients did not necessarily fit the commercial indications for ScoliScore, we contacted the patients and obtained a saliva sample from each for genetic analysis. We then tested whether ScoliScore correlated with the outcome of their bracing therapy.\nRESULTS: We were able to contact and invite 25 eligible subjects, of whom 16 (64.0%) returned samples for laboratory analysis. Patients were followed for an average of 2.3 years (range, 1.1-4 y) after initiation of the Providence brace. Eight patients (50.0%) progressed to >45 degrees, whereas the other 8 patients (50.0%) did not. The mean ScoliScore among those who progressed to >45 degrees was higher than that among those who did not (176 vs. 112, P=0.030).\nCONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that a genetic test correlates with bracing outcome.

Transcripts were analyzed using selective coding for issues related to error definition, mitigation, and communication. Additional thematic analysis captured themes across content categories.\nRESULTS: Key informants suggested that the potential for adverse events exists in all phases of genetic testing, from ordering to analysis, interpretation, and follow-up. A perceived contributor was lack of physician knowledge about genetics, resulting in errors in test ordering and interpretation. The limitations and uncertainty inherent to rapidly evolving technology were also seen as contributing factors. Strategies to prevent errors included physician education, availability of genetic experts for consultation, and enhanced communication such as improved test reports and electronic decision support.\nCONCLUSION: Genetic testing poses concerns for patient safety due to errors and the limitations of current tests. As genomic tests are integrated into medical care, anticipating and addressing patient safety concerns identified by these key informants will be crucial.Genet Med 18 11, 1136-1142.",

We report on the initial 69 patients with gynecologic cancers that were either rare or refractory to standard therapy. CGP was performed by Foundation Medicine, Inc. Genomic alterations were reviewed by members of an MTB. Consensus recommendations on genomically targeted, FDA-approved, on- and off-label therapies and clinical trials were sent to the treating physician, and decisions and outcomes were assessed.\nRESULTS: Study outcomes were available for 64 patients. The mean number of genes altered per tumor was 4.97 (median=4; range, 1-26), and the average turnaround time from testing laboratory report to generation of formal recommendations was approximately three weeks. Evaluation of genomic and clinical data by the MTB led to generation of targeted treatment options in all 64 patients, and the percentage of patients for whom one or more of these recommendations were implemented by the treating physician was 39%. Sixty-four percent of the patients receiving targeted therapy based on a CGP result experienced radiologic response or showed evidence of clinical benefit or stable disease.\nCONCLUSION: These data suggest that an institutional MTB is a feasible venue for reviewing tumor genomic profiling results and generating clinical recommendations.

Additional objectives were to record outcomes and enable scientific discussions of mutations which may foster local translational research. FoundationOne was the preferred genomic platform; results were reviewed by a team comprised of disease site specialists, phase I trialists, and basic and translational scientists affiliated with the Gynecologic Cancer Program. A detailed database for each patient was created and is followed prospectively for treatment use and resultant outcomes.\nRESULTS: To date, we have presented 62 cases with interpretable FoundationOne testing on 60 tumor samples (31 ovarian, 18 uterine, 9 cervical, and 4 other female genital tract). Significant genomic alterations were commonly found in all tumor types (median: 3); TP53 (45%) and PIK3CA (27%) were the most frequently noted mutations; however, molecular profiling resulted in identification of few actionable mutations (6%). To date, we have matched 4 patients on therapies based on actionable mutations.\nCONCLUSIONS: The predominant function of our PMB is establishment of a forum to enhance research while providing clinical care for refractory malignancies. We have matched patients with specific mutations to ongoing trials and are developing investigator-initiated studies based on trends within genomic profiling results.

This article describes the outcomes of the program and makes recommendations for improving it and informing other public health care programs.\nMETHODS: Subjects were referred for molecular testing of the mismatch repair (MMR) genes MutL homolog 1, MutS homolog 2, and MutS homolog 6 if they met 1 of 7 MOH criteria. Testing was conducted from January 2001 to March 2015 at the Molecular Diagnostic Laboratory of Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto.\nRESULTS: A total of 1452 subjects were tested. Of the 662 subjects referred for testing because their tumor was immunodeficient for 1 or more of the MMR genes, 251 (37.9%) carried a germline mutation. In addition, 597 subjects were tested for a known family mutation, and 298 (49.9%) were positive; 189 of these 298 subjects (63.4%) were affected with cancer at the time of testing. An additional 193 subjects were referred because of a family history of LS, and 34 of these (17.6%) had a mutation identified.\nCONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that the provincial criteria are useful in identifying LS carriers after an MMR-deficient tumor is identified.

Our objective was to integrate clinical and pharmacogenetic determinants in an ultimate combined risk prediction model.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Clinical, genetic, and outcomes data were used from 8726 stable CAD patients participating in the EUROPA/PERGENE trial of perindopril versus placebo. Multivariable analysis of phenotype data resulted in a clinical risk score (range, 0-21 points). Three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (rs275651 and rs5182 in the angiotensin-II type I-receptor gene and rs12050217 in the bradykinin type I-receptor gene) were used to construct a pharmacogenetic risk score (PGXscore; range, 0-6 points). Seven hundred eighty-five patients (9.0%) experienced the primary endpoint of cardiovascular mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction or resuscitated cardiac arrest, during 4.2\u00a0years of follow-up. Absolute risk reductions ranged from 1.2% to 7.5% in the 73.5% of patients with PGXscore of 0 to 2.

Furthermore, our data suggest that long-term perindopril prescription in patients with a PGXscore of 0 to 2 is cost-effective.\nCONCLUSIONS: Both baseline clinical phenotype, as well as genotype determine the efficacy of widely prescribed ACE inhibition in stable CAD.

There is a gap in the literature about the perceived clinical utility of pharmacogenomic testing among anesthesia providers.\nMETHODS: This qualitative-quantitative sequential mixed-method study used focused interviews to formulate probes for a quantitative survey aimed at quantifying the perceptions of anesthesia providers about pharmacogenomic testing.\nRESULTS: The results indicate anesthesia providers do not have enough knowledge about pharmacogenomic testing for it to be considered clinically useful in anesthesia practice.\nCONCLUSION: Although outcomes data indicate pharmacogenomic testing can help predict outcomes, anesthesia providers do not have enough knowledge and have concerns about the ethical implications of pharmacogenomic testing.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: With the increasing request for BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation tests, several risk models have been developed to predict the presence of mutation in these genes; in this study, we have developed an efficient BRCA genetic testing strategy.\nMETHOD: As first step, to identify predictor variables associated with BRCA status, we have undertaken a cumulative mutation analysis including data from three Tunisian studies. Then, we have developed a logistic regression model for predicting the likelihood of harboring a BRCA mutation. Using receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC), an effective evaluation was performed. A total of 92 Tunisian families were included. Overall, 27 women were positive for BRCA1/BRCA2 deleterious mutations.\nRESULTS: Tow recurrent mutations (c.211dupA and c.5266dupC) explained 76\u00a0% of BRCA1-related families and three recurrent mutations (c.1310_1313del, c.1542_1547delAAGA and c.7887_7888insA) explained 90\u00a0% of BRCA2-related families. Early age at diagnosis of breast cancer, ovarian cancer, bilateral breast cancer were associated with BRCA1, whereas male breast cancer and four or more breast cancer cases in the family were associated with BRCA2. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the risk score was 0.802 (95\u00a0% confidence interval\u00a0=\u00a00.0699-0. 905).\nCONCLUSION: Logistic regression reported particular profiles related to BRCA germline mutation carriers in our population, as well as an efficient prediction model that may be a useful tool for increasing the cost-effectiveness of genetic testing strategy.",

        "abstract": "Non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) for aneuploidy is currently only available in the UK through the private sector outside of the research arena. As part of an implementation study in the UK National Health Service we conducted a mixed methods study to assess women's experience of being offered NIPT using validated measures of decisional conflict, decisional regret and anxiety. Clinical service preferences were also explored. Women with a Down syndrome screening risk >1:1000 were invited to take part in the study and offered NIPT, NIPT and invasive testing (for women with a risk above 1:150) or no further testing. A cross-sectional survey and semi-structured interviews were conducted at two time points; at the time of testing and one month following receipt of results (or equivalent for NIPT decliners). In total, 845 questionnaires and 81 interviews were analysed. The main motivation to accept NIPT was for reassurance (30.8%). Decisional conflict occurred in a minimal number of cases (3.8%), however, none of the participants experienced decisional regret. Around a third (29.9%) of women had elevated anxiety at the time of testing, including intermediate risk women who traditionally would not be offered further testing (54.4% high risk; 20.1% medium risk), a finding supported through the qualitative interviews where prolonged or additional anxiety was found to occur in some medium risk cases. Women were overwhelmingly positive about the opportunity to have a test that was procedurally safe, accurate, reduced the need for invasive testing and identified cases of Down syndrome that might otherwise have been missed. Reassurance was identified as the main motivator for accepting NIPT, particularly amongst medium risk women, with high risk women inclined to accept NIPT to inform decisions around invasive testing. The current turnaround time for test result was identified as a key limitation. All the women interviewed thought NIPT should be adopted as part of NHS clinical practice, with the majority favouring NIPT offered as a first-line test. Our study highlights the potential that NIPT has to positively impact women's experience of prenatal testing for aneuploidy.",

We sought to understand the impact of receiving genomic recurrence risk estimates on breast cancer patients' well-being and the impact of these patient-reported outcomes on receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy. Participants were 193 women (mean age 57) newly diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer. Women were interviewed before and 2-3 weeks after receiving the RS result between 2011 and 2015. We assessed subsequent receipt of chemotherapy from chart review. After receiving their RS, perceived pros (t = 4.27, P < .001) and cons (t = 8.54, P < .001) of chemotherapy increased from pre-test to post-test, while perceived risk of breast cancer recurrence decreased (t = 2.90, P = .004). Women with high RS tumors were more likely to receive chemotherapy than women with low RS tumors (88 vs. 5 %, OR 0.01, 0.00-0.02, P < .001). Higher distress (OR 2.19, 95 % CI 1.05-4.57, P < .05) and lower perceived cons of chemotherapy (OR 0.50, 95 % CI 0.26-0.97, P < .05) also predicted receipt of chemotherapy.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Since 2006, the genetic testing company 23andMe has collected biological samples, self-reported information, and consent documents for biobanking and research from more than 1,000,000 individuals (90% participating in research), through a direct-to-consumer (DTC) online genetic-testing service providing a genetic ancestry report and a genetic health report. However, on November 22, 2013, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) halted the sale of genetic health testing, on the grounds that 23andMe was not acting in accordance with federal law, by selling tests of undemonstrated reliability as predictive tests for medical risk factors. Consumers could still obtain the genetic ancestry report, but they no longer had access to the genetic health report in the United States (US). However, this did not prevent the company from continuing its health research, with previously obtained and future samples, provided that consent had been obtained from the consumers concerned, or with health reports for individuals from other countries. Furthermore, 23andMe was granted FDA authorization on February 19, 2015, first to provide reports about Bloom syndrome carrier status, and, more recently, to provide consumers with \"carrier status\" information for 35 genes known (with high levels of confidence) to cause disease.\nDISCUSSION: In this Debate, we highlight the likelihood that the primary objective of the company was probably two-fold: promoting itself within the market for predictive testing for human genetic diseases and ancestry at a low cost to consumers, and establishing a high-value database/biobank for research (one of the largest biobanks of human deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and personal information). By dint of this marketing approach, a two-sided market has been established between the consumer and the research laboratories, involving the establishment of a database/DNA biobank for scientific and financial gain.

At the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC), we developed the Pediatric Molecular Tumor Board (PMTB) to track, integrate, and interpret clinical genomic profiling and potential targeted therapeutic recommendations.\nPROCEDURE: This retrospective case series includes all patients reviewed by the MSKCC PMTB from July 2014 to June 2015. Cases were submitted by treating oncologists and potential treatment recommendations were based upon the modified guidelines of the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine.\nRESULTS: There were 41 presentations of 39 individual patients during the study period. Gliomas, acute myeloid leukemia, and neuroblastoma were the most commonly reviewed cases. Thirty nine (87%) of the 45 molecular sequencing profiles utilized hybrid-capture targeted genome sequencing. In 30 (73%) of the 41 presentations, the PMTB provided therapeutic recommendations, of which 19 (46%) were implemented. Twenty-one (70%) of the recommendations involved targeted therapies. Three (14%) targeted therapy recommendations had published evidence to support the proposed recommendations (evidence levels 1-2), eight (36%) recommendations had preclinical evidence (level 3), and 11 (50%) recommendations were based upon hypothetical biological rationales (level 4).\nCONCLUSIONS: The MSKCC PMTB enabled a clinically relevant interpretation of genomic profiling. Effective use of clinical genomics is anticipated to require new and improved tools to ascribe pathogenic significance and therapeutic actionability. The development of specific rule-driven clinical protocols will be needed for the incorporation and evaluation of genomic and molecular profiling in interventional prospective clinical trials.",

The trial enrolled 78,216 women, randomized into either a screening arm with annual serum cancer antigen 125 and pelvic ultrasounds, or usual care arm. This study identified a subgroup that reported a first degree relative with breast or ovarian cancer. Analysis was performed to compare overall mortality and disease specific mortality in the screening versus usual care arm. In patients diagnosed with ovarian cancer, stage distribution, and survival were analyzed as a secondary endpoint.\nRESULTS: There was no significant difference in overall mortality or disease specific mortality between the two arms. Ovarian cancer was diagnosed in 48 patients in the screening arm and 44 patients in the usual care arm. Screened patients were more likely to be diagnosed at an earlier stage than usual care patients. Patients in the screening arm diagnosed with ovarian cancer experienced a significantly improved survival compared to patients in the usual care arm; relative risk 0.66 (95% CI, 0.47 to 0.93).\nCONCLUSION: Screening did not appear to decrease ovarian cancer mortality in participants with a family history of breast or ovarian cancer. Secondary endpoints, however, showed notable differences. Significantly fewer patients were diagnosed with advanced stage disease in the screening arm; and survival was significantly improved.

If untreated, life expectancy in heterozygous FH patients is shortened by 20-30 years compared with the general population. Nevertheless, treatment goals are only met in approximately 50% of patients. This comparative study examined the quality of life (QoL) impact of FH in patients who had and had not reached the target of treatment.\nMETHODS: Two qualitative focus group interviews were carried out with a total of ten FH patients. A semi-structured interview guide included questions identified in a preceding literature study. The data were analysed using a medical anthropological approach.\nRESULTS: While having FH did not have much impact on well-treated patients' QoL, patients who had not reached the treatment target had markedly more concerns. They had experienced severe side-effects and worried about their own and their relatives' health. They were concerned about the long-term impact of not being effectively treated including the risk that coronary heart disease could cause their premature death or disability and inability to care for their children, in particular. The women had issues with stigma and self-efficacy.\nCONCLUSIONS: The QoL impact of FH is related to treatment efficacy. These findings need to be addressed in the management of FH patients. Particular attention should be paid to those who are not presently reaching the target of treatment.\nFUNDING: The study was funded by a research grant from Amgen.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: not relevant.",

Appropriate consent documents for sample donors must therefore explain the breadth of consent and other elements of the biobank governance framework. Recent reviews demonstrated high variability in what issues these documents mention or not and how the issues are explained. This might undermine the protection of sample donors, complicate networked biobank research, create research waste and impact on public trust.\nMETHODS: A systematic analysis of international research guidelines and existing broad consent templates was performed. Based on this information an interdisciplinary expert group from the AKMEK (Permanent Working Party of German RECs) developed a draft template and organized a comprehensive stakeholder consultation. After revision the final template was consented by all 53 German RECs.\nRESULTS: This paper briefly explores the spectrum of potentially relevant issues for broad consent forms. It then elaborates the template and how it was designed to be applicable in different types of biobanks.\nDISCUSSION: To further improve the validity and applicability of broad consent forms in biobank and other big data research, practice evaluations are needed.

Many large institutions are making a significant investment in infrastructure and technology, allowing clinicians to access CGES, especially as health-care coverage begins to extend to clinically indicated genomic sequencing-based tests. Translating and realizing the comprehensive clinical benefits of genomic medicine remain a key challenge for the current and future care of patients. With the increasing application of CGES, it is necessary for geneticists and other health-care providers to understand its benefits and limitations in order to interpret the clinical relevance of genomic variants identified in the context of health and disease. New, collaborative working relationships with specialists across diverse disciplines (e.g., clinicians, laboratorians, bioinformaticians) will undoubtedly be key attributes of the future practice of clinical genetics and may serve as an example for other specialties in medicine. These new skills and relationships will also inform the development of the future model of clinical genetics training curricula. To address the evolving role of the clinical geneticist in the rapidly changing climate of genomic medicine, two Clinical Genetics Think Tank meetings were held that brought together physicians, laboratorians, scientists, genetic counselors, trainees, and patients with experience in clinical genetics, genetic diagnostics, and genetics education.

The objective of this study is to examine the author affiliations of genomic epidemiology publications in order to make recommendations for building local genomics research capacity in SSA.\nDESIGN: SSA genomic epidemiology articles published between 2004 and 2013 were extracted from the Human Genome Epidemiology (HuGE) database. Data on authorship details, country of population studied, and phenotype or disease were extracted. Factors associated with the first author, who has an SSA institution affiliation (AIAFA), were determined using a Chi-square test and multiple logistic regression analysis.\nRESULTS: The most commonly studied population was South Africa, accounting for 31.1%, followed by Ghana (10.6%) and Kenya (7.5%). About one-tenth of the papers were related to non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as cancer (6.1%) and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) (4.3%). Fewer than half of the first authors (46.9%) were affiliated with an African institution. Among the 238 articles with an African first author, over three-quarters (79.8%) belonged to a university or medical school, 16.8% were affiliated with a research institute, and 3.4% had affiliations with other institutions.\nCONCLUSIONS: Significant disparities currently exist among SSA countries in genomics research capacity. South Africa has the highest genomics research output, which is reflected in the investments made in its genomics and biotechnology sector.

This article analyzes the access governance arrangements of the original five biobank members of the Biobank Standardisation and Harmonisation for Research Excellence in the European Union (BioSHaRE-EU) project in Finland, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, and the United Kingdom to identify similarities and differences in policies and procedures, and consider the potential for internal policy \"harmonization.\" Our analysis found differences in the range of researchers and organizations eligible to access biobanks; application processes; requirements for Research Ethics Committee approval; and terms of Material Transfer Agreements relating to ownership and commercialization. However, the main elements of access are the same across biobanks; access will be granted to bona fide researchers conducting research in the public interest, and all biobanks will consider the scientific merit of the proposed use and it's compatibility with the biobank's objectives. These findings suggest potential areas for harmonization across biobanks. This could be achieved through a single centralized application to a number of biobanks or a system of mutual recognition that places a presumption in favor of access to one biobank if already approved by another member of the same consortium. Biobanking and Biomolecular Resources Research Infrastructure-European Research Infrastructure Consortia (BBMRI-ERIC), a European consortium of biobanks and bioresources with its own ethical, legal, and social implications (ELSI) common service, could provide a platform by developing guidelines for harmonized internal processes.",

        "title": "Impact of a bronchial genomic classifier on clinical decision making in patients undergoing diagnostic evaluation for lung cancer.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Bronchoscopy is frequently used for the evaluation of suspicious pulmonary lesions found on computed tomography, but its sensitivity for detecting lung cancer is limited. Recently, a bronchial genomic classifier was validated to improve the sensitivity of bronchoscopy for lung cancer detection, demonstrating a high sensitivity and negative predictive value among patients at intermediate risk (10-60\u00a0%) for lung cancer with an inconclusive bronchoscopy. Our objective for this study was to determine if a negative genomic classifier result that down-classifies a patient from intermediate risk to low risk (<10\u00a0%) for lung cancer would reduce the rate that physicians recommend more invasive testing among patients with an inconclusive bronchoscopy.\nMETHODS: We conducted a randomized, prospective, decision impact survey study assessing pulmonologist recommendations in patients undergoing workup for lung cancer who had an inconclusive bronchoscopy. Cases with an intermediate pretest risk for lung cancer were selected from the AEGIS trials and presented in a randomized fashion to pulmonologists either with or without the patient's bronchial genomic classifier result to determine how the classifier results impacted physician decisions.\nRESULTS: Two hundred two physicians provided 1523 case evaluations on 36 patients. Invasive procedure recommendations were reduced from 57\u00a0% without the classifier result to 18\u00a0% with a negative (low risk) classifier result (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Invasive procedure recommendations increased from 50 to 65\u00a0% with a positive (intermediate risk) classifier result (p\u2009<\u20090.001). When stratifying by ultimate disease diagnosis, there was an overall reduction in invasive procedure recommendations in patients with benign disease when classifier results were reported (54 to 41\u00a0%, p\u2009<\u20090.001). For patients ultimately diagnosed with malignant disease, there was an overall increase in invasive procedure recommendations when the classifier results were reported (50 to 64\u00a0%, p\u2009=\u20090.003).\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that a negative (low risk) bronchial genomic classifier result reduces invasive procedure recommendations following an inconclusive bronchoscopy and that the classifier overall reduces invasive procedure recommendations among patients ultimately diagnosed with benign disease. These results support the potential clinical utility of the classifier to improve management of patients undergoing bronchoscopy for suspect lung cancer by reducing additional invasive procedures in the setting of benign disease.",

        "abstract": "Patient decision-making regarding breast cancer surgery is multifactorial, and patients derive information on surgical treatment options from a variety of sources which may have an impact on choice of surgery. We investigated the role of different information sources in patient decision-making regarding breast cancer surgery. Two hundred and sixty-eight patients with breast cancer, eligible for breast-conserving therapy were surveyed in the immediate preoperative period, and clinical data were also collected. This survey evaluated the scope and features of patient-driven research regarding their ultimate choice of surgical treatment. The two most common sources of information used by patients were written material from surgeons (199/268-74%) and the Internet (184/268-69%). There was a trend for women who chose bilateral mastectomy to use the Internet more frequently than those choosing unilateral mastectomy (P = 0.056). Number of surgeons consulted, genetic testing, and MRI were significant predictors of patient choice of mastectomy over breast-conserving therapy. Multivariate analysis showed that the number of surgeons consulted (P < 0.001) and genetic testing (P < 0.001) were independent predictors of choosing mastectomy, whereas MRI was not. In conclusions, understanding factors driving patient decision-making may promote more effective education for patients requiring breast cancer surgery.",

Thirty-eight specimens (3.4%) were reported as \"no results\" due to NGS assay failure. Higher failure rates were observed in specimens submitted for lung cancer panel and melanoma panel (3.1% and 3.7% vs 1.0% colorectal cancer panel), metastatic bone specimens (36% vs 2.6% nonbone specimens), referred specimens (5.0% vs 1.8% in-house specimens), and small biopsy and FNA specimens (5.8% and 3.1% vs 0.7% resection/excision specimens). Test feasibility was higher in in-house specimens than referred specimens (99.1% vs 96.9% in resection specimens, 94.4% vs 87.3% in small biopsy specimens, and 94.3% vs 58.8% in FNA specimens).\nCONCLUSIONS: NGS assays demonstrated clinical utility in solid tumor specimens, including those taken by biopsy or FNA. Preanalytic factors identified by this study that may contribute to NGS assay failure highlight the need for pathologists to revisit tissue processing protocols in order to better optimize cancer mutational profiling.",

We therefore sought to evaluate long-term coronary heart disease (CHD) and total ASCVD risks in US adults with an FH phenotype.\nMETHODS: Using individual pooled data from 6 large US epidemiological cohorts, we stratified participants by low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level at index ages from 20 to 79 years. For the primary analysis, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels \u2265190 and <130 mg/dL defined the FH phenotype and referent, respectively. Sensitivity analyses evaluated the effects of varying the FH phenotype definition. We used Cox regression models to assess covariate-adjusted associations of the FH phenotype with 30-year hazards for CHD (CHD death or nonfatal myocardial infarction) and total ASCVD (CHD or stroke).\nRESULTS: We included 68\u2009565 baseline person-examinations; 3850 (5.6%) had the FH phenotype by the primary definition. Follow-up across index ages ranged from 78\u2009985 to 308\u2009378 person-years. After covariate adjustment, the FH phenotype was associated with substantially elevated 30-year CHD risk, with hazard ratios up to 5.0 (95% confidence interval, 1.1-21.7). Across index ages, CHD risk was accelerated in those with the FH phenotype by 10 to 20 years in men and 20 to 30 years in women. Similar patterns of results were found for total ASCVD risk, with hazard ratios up to 4.1 (95% confidence interval, 1.2-13.4). Alternative FH phenotype definitions incorporating family history, more stringent age-based low-density lipoprotein cholesterol thresholds, or alternative lipid fractions decreased the FH phenotype prevalence to as low as 0.2% to 0.4% without materially affecting CHD risk estimates (hazard ratios up to 8.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.0-61.6).\nCONCLUSIONS: In the general US population, the long-term ASCVD burden related to phenotypic FH, defined by low-density lipoprotein cholesterol \u2265190 mg/dL, is likely substantial. Our finding of CHD risk acceleration may aid efforts in risk communication.",

        "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Although poorly understood, there is heterogeneity in the molecular biology of cancer across race and ethnicities. The representation of racial minorities in large genomic sequencing efforts is unclear, and could have an impact on health care disparities.\nOBJECTIVE: To determine the racial distribution among samples sequenced within The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the deficit of samples needed to detect moderately common mutational frequencies in racial minorities.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a retrospective review of individual patient data from TCGA data portal accessed in July 2015. TCGA comprises samples from a wide array of institutions primarily across the United States. Samples from 10 of the 31 currently available tumor types were analyzed, comprising 5729 samples from the approximately 11\u202f000 available.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Using the estimated median somatic mutational frequency, the samples needed beyond TCGA to detect a 10% and 5% mutational frequency over the background somatic mutation frequency were calculated for each tumor type by racial ethnicity.\nRESULTS: Of the 5729 samples, 77% (n\u2009=\u20094389) were white, 12% (n\u2009=\u2009660) were black, 3% (n\u2009=\u2009173) were Asian, 3% (n\u2009=\u2009149) were Hispanic, and less than 0.5% combined were from patients of Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander, Alaskan Native, or American Indian decent. This overrepresents white patients compared with the US population and underrepresents primarily Asian and Hispanic patients. With a somatic mutational frequency of 0.7 (prostate cancer) to 9.9 (lung squamous cell cancer), all tumor types from white patients contained enough samples to detect a 10% mutational frequency. This is in contrast to all other racial ethnicities, for which group-specific mutations with 10% frequency would be detectable only for black patients with breast cancer. Group-specific mutations with 5% frequency would be undetectable in any racial minority, but detectable in white patients for all cancer types except lung (adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma) and colon cancer.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: It is probable, but poorly understood, that ethnic diversity is related to the pathogenesis of cancer, and may have an impact on the generalizability of findings from TCGA to racial minorities. Despite the important benefits that continue to be gained from genomic sequencing, dedicated efforts are needed to avoid widening the already pervasive gap in health care disparities.",

We reviewed clinical utility and response rates in correlation to NGS results. Forty-three patients were profiled: 34 glioblastomas, 8 anaplastic astrocytomas, and one patient with anaplastic oligodendroglioma. Twenty-five patients were profiled with the 315 gene panel. The median number of identified genomic alterations (GAs) per patient was 4.5 (range 1-23). In 41 patients (95\u2009%) at least one therapeutically-actionable GA was detected, most commonly in EGFR [17 (40\u2009%)]. Genotype-directed treatments were prescribed in 13 patients, representing a 30\u2009% treatment decision impact. Treatment with targeted agents included everolimus as a single agent and in combination with erlotinib; erlotinib; afatinib; palbociclib; trametinib and BGJ398. Treatments targeted various genomic findings including EGFR alterations, mTOR activation, cell cycle targets and FGFR1 mutations. None of the patients showed response to respective biologic treatments. In this group of patients with HGG, NGS revealed a high frequency of GAs that lead to targeted treatment in 30\u2009% of the patients.

The influence of different consent models on willingness to share data was examined by randomizing participants to one of eight consent scenarios.\nRESULTS: Of 4,777 people invited to take the survey, 2,706 responded and 2,601 (54% response rate) provided valid responses. Most respondents (79%) supported the proposed study, and 54% said they would definitely or probably participate if asked. Support for and willingness to participate in the study varied little among demographic groups; younger respondents, LGBT respondents, and those with more years of education were significantly more likely to take part if asked. The most important study incentive that the survey asked about was learning about one's own health information. Willingness to share data and samples under broad, study-by-study, menu and dynamic consent models was similar when a statement about transparency was included in the consent scenarios. Respondents were generally interested in taking part in several governance functions of the cohort study.\nCONCLUSIONS: A large majority of the U.S. adults who responded to the survey supported a large national cohort study. Levels of support for the study and willingness to participate were both consistent across most demographic groups.

Untreated FH is associated with premature cardiovascular disease in adulthood.\nOBJECTIVE: To systematically review the evidence on benefits and harms of screening adolescents and children for heterozygous FH for the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF).\nDATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and PubMed were searched for studies published between January 1, 2005, and June 2, 2015; studies included in a previous USPSTF report were also searched. Surveillance was conducted through April 8, 2016.\nSTUDY SELECTION: Fair- and good-quality studies in English with participants 0 to 20 years of age.\nDATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two investigators independently reviewed abstracts and full-text articles and extracted data into evidence tables. Results were qualitatively summarized.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke in adulthood; lipid concentrations and atherosclerosis in childhood; diagnostic yield of screening; any harm of screening or treatment.\nRESULTS: Based on 2 studies (n\u2009=\u200983,241), the diagnostic yield of universal screening for FH in childhood is 1.3 to 4.8 cases per 1000 screened. There was no eligible evidence on the benefits or harms of FH screening in childhood. Eight placebo trials of statin drugs (n\u2009=\u20091071, 6-104 weeks) found low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) decreases of 20% to 40%; 1 trial (n\u2009=\u2009214) showed a 2.01% decrease in carotid intima-media thickness with statins, compared with 1.02% with placebo (P\u2009=\u2009.02). Three placebo trials of bile acid-sequestering agents (n\u2009=\u2009332, 8-52 weeks) showed LDL-C reductions of 10% to 20%. In 1 trial (n\u2009=\u2009248), ezetimibe with simvastatin resulted in greater LDL-C reductions compared with simvastatin alone at 33 weeks (mean, -54.0% [SD, 1.4%] vs -38.1% [SD, 1.4%]). One trial of ezetimibe monotherapy (n\u2009=\u2009138) showed mean LDL-C decreases of 28% (95% CI, -31% to -25%) from baseline and negligible change with placebo at 12 weeks. Eighteen studies found statins generally well tolerated. One observational study found lower, but still normal, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate concentrations in statin-treated males with FH at 10-year follow-up. Bile acid-sequestering agents were commonly associated with adverse gastrointestinal symptoms and poor palatability. There was no eligible evidence on the effect of FH treatment on myocardial infarction or stroke in adulthood.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Screening can detect FH in children, and lipid-lowering treatment in childhood can reduce lipid concentrations in the short term, with little evidence of harm. There is no evidence for the effect of screening for FH in childhood on lipid concentrations or cardiovascular outcomes in adulthood, or on the long-term benefits or harms of beginning lipid-lowering treatment in childhood.",

Methods have become available allowing rapid expanded carrier screening for a substantial number of conditions.\nOBJECTIVES: To quantify the modeled risk of recessive conditions identifiable by an expanded carrier screening panel in individuals of diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds and to compare the results with those from current screening recommendations.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective modeling analysis of results between January 1, 2012, and July 15, 2015, from expanded carrier screening in reproductive-aged individuals without known indication for specific genetic testing, primarily from the United States. Tests were offered by clinicians providing reproductive care.\nEXPOSURES: Individuals were tested for carrier status for up to 94 severe or profound conditions.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Risk was defined as the probability that a hypothetical fetus created from a random pairing of individuals (within or across 15 self-reported racial/ethnic categories; there were 11 categories with >5000 samples) would be homozygous or compound heterozygous for 2 mutations presumed to cause severe or profound disease. Severe conditions were defined as those that if left untreated cause intellectual disability or a substantially shortened lifespan; profound conditions were those causing both.\nRESULTS: The study included 346,790 individuals. Among major US racial/ethnic categories, the calculated frequency of fetuses potentially affected by a profound or severe condition ranged from 94.5 per 100,000 (95% CI, 82.4-108.3 per 100,000) for Hispanic couples to 392.2 per 100,000 (95% CI, 366.3-420.2 per 100,000) for Ashkenazi Jewish couples. In most racial/ethnic categories, expanded carrier screening modeled more hypothetical fetuses at risk for severe or profound conditions than did screening based on current professional guidelines (Mann-Whitney P\u2009<\u2009.001). For Northern European couples, the 2 professional guidelines-based screening panels modeled 55.2 hypothetical fetuses affected per 100,000 (95% CI, 51.3-59.3 per 100,000) and the expanded carrier screening modeled 159.2 fetuses per 100,000 (95% CI, 150.4-168.6 per 100,000). Overall, relative to expanded carrier screening, guideline-based screening ranged from identification of 6% (95% CI, 4%-8%) of hypothetical fetuses affected for East Asian couples to 87% (95% CI, 84%-90%) for African or African American couples.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In a population of diverse races and ethnicities, expanded carrier screening may increase the detection of carrier status for a variety of potentially serious genetic conditions compared with current recommendations from professional societies. Prospective studies comparing current standard-of-care carrier screening with expanded carrier screening in at-risk populations are warranted before expanded screening is adopted.",

        "title": "Cost-effectiveness of PCSK9 Inhibitor Therapy in Patients With Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia or Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease.",
        "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors were recently approved for lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) or atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and have potential for broad ASCVD prevention. Their long-term cost-effectiveness and effect on total health care spending are uncertain.\nOBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of PCSK9 inhibitors and their potential effect on US health care spending.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Cardiovascular Disease Policy Model, a simulation model of US adults aged 35 to 94 years, was used to evaluate cost-effectiveness of PCSK9 inhibitors or ezetimibe in heterozygous FH or ASCVD. The model incorporated 2015 annual PCSK9 inhibitor costs of $14,350 (based on mean wholesale acquisition costs of evolocumab and alirocumab); adopted a health-system perspective, lifetime horizon; and included probabilistic sensitivity analyses to explore uncertainty.\nEXPOSURES: Statin therapy compared with addition of ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Lifetime major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE: cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or stroke), incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), and total effect on US health care spending over 5 years.\nRESULTS: Adding PCSK9 inhibitors to statins in heterozygous FH was estimated to prevent 316,300 MACE at a cost of $503,000 per QALY gained compared with adding ezetimibe to statins (80% uncertainty interval [UI], $493,000-$1,737,000). In ASCVD, adding PCSK9 inhibitors to statins was estimated to prevent 4.3 million MACE compared with adding ezetimibe at $414,000 per QALY (80% UI, $277,000-$1,539,000). Reducing annual drug costs to $4536 per patient or less would be needed for PCSK9 inhibitors to be cost-effective at less than $100,000 per QALY. At 2015 prices, PCSK9 inhibitor use in all eligible patients was estimated to reduce cardiovascular care costs by $29 billion over 5 years, but drug costs increased by an estimated $592 billion (a 38% increase over 2015 prescription drug expenditures). In contrast, initiating statins in these high-risk populations in all statin-tolerant individuals who are not currently using statins was estimated to save $12 billion.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Assuming 2015 prices, PCSK9 inhibitor use in patients with heterozygous FH or ASCVD did not meet generally acceptable incremental cost-effectiveness thresholds and was estimated to increase US health care costs substantially. Reducing annual drug prices from more than $14,000 to $4536 would be necessary to meet a $100,000 per QALY threshold.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Lynch syndrome is a genetic syndrome that integrates a large spectrum of cancers caused by germline mutations in mismatch repair genes. Its incidence is underestimated due to a lack of systematic screening in the population. Because upper tract urothelial carcinoma is the third-most common cancer associated with the syndrome, urologists should be aware of the diagnostic pathway.\nRECENT FINDINGS: Lynch syndrome can be positively diagnosed after the three following distinct steps: meeting the clinical criteria, tissue and genetic testing, and familial genetic counseling. It must be suspected for patients with upper tract urothelial carcinoma before the age of 60 years and in cases of evocative personal/familial medical histories. When a diagnosis is suspected, immunohistochemistry and Polymerase Chain Reaction are the next steps to confirm the diagnosis. After confirmation, the key to management is a good surveillance to prevent disease recurrence using urinary analysis and imaging as well as screening of first-degree relatives.\nSUMMARY: Despite the lack of high-level studies of upper tract urothelial carcinoma in Lynch syndrome, its prevalence is not negligible. Thus, expert recommendations are required for its management. Individuals and family should be informed of the importance of close screening and surveillance.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Colonoscopic screening is recommended for first-degree relatives of patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer (CRC) or colorectal adenomatous polyps (CAP) before the age of 60 years. This has the potential to reduce CRC-related morbidity and mortality, but uptake is currently inadequate.\nMETHODS: The aim of the study was to compare the effectiveness of standard information versus a nurse-led tailored intervention designed to promote uptake of colonoscopy screening by siblings of CRC or CAP patients. A randomized controlled trial was conducted. Digestive surgeons and gastroenterologists recruited index patients who developed CRC or CAP before the age of 60 years. All index patients received standard screening information for their siblings, in keeping with current guidelines. Centrally computerized randomization of index patients resulted in allocating all their siblings to the same group, intervention or control. The tailored intervention targeted the index patient first, to help them convey information to their siblings. The nurse then provided the siblings with tailored information based on their answers to a self-questionnaire which explored health behaviors, derived from psychosocial models of prevention. Then the siblings were given a personalized information leaflet to hand to their regular physician. The primary endpoint was the rate of documented colonoscopy performed in siblings within 1 year after diagnosis of the index patient. The intent-to-treat analysis included siblings who refused to participate in the study. Statistical analysis was adjusted for intrafamilial correlation.\nRESULTS: A total of 304 siblings of 125 index patients were included: 160 in the intervention group and 144 in the control group. The rate of colonoscopy uptake among siblings was 56.3% in the intervention group and 35.4% in the control group (P = 0.0027). The respective rates after exclusion of refusals were 69.2% and 37.0% (P\u200a<\u200a0.0001). More lesions were detected in the intervention group (1 invasive cancer and 11 advanced adenomas vs 5 advanced adenomas; P = 0.022).\nCONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the effectiveness of a nurse-led tailored intervention designed to promote colonoscopy screening uptake by siblings of patients diagnosed with CRC or CAP before age 60 years. Such tailored interventions that also involve physicians should help to reduce CRC-related mortality.",

Medical literature was searched for prenatal screening and genetic laboratory testing methods in use or under development and discussed in relationship to PWS. Genetic testing includes six established laboratory diagnostic approaches for PWS with direct application to prenatal screening. Ultrasonographic, obstetric and cytogenetic reports were summarized in relationship to the cause of PWS and identification of specific genetic subtypes including maternal disomy 15. Advances in genetic technology were described for diagnosing PWS specifically DNA methylation and high-resolution chromosomal SNP microarrays as current tools for genetic screening and incorporating next generation DNA sequencing for noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) using cell-free fetal DNA. Positive experiences are reported with NIPT for detection of numerical chromosomal problems (aneuploidies) but not for structural problems (microdeletions). These reports will be discussed along with future directions for genetic screening of PWS. In summary, this review describes and discusses the status of established and ongoing genetic testing options for PWS applicable in prenatal screening including NIPT and future directions for early diagnosis in PWS. \u00a9 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to investigate the use of concurrent genetic screening together with standard newborn hearing screening (NHS) in an effort to provide a scientific basis for the beneficial use of concurrent genetic hearing screening in newborns. Our aim was to improve the neonatal detection rate of hearing impairment and the potential for hearing loss, allowing for increased early intervention and potentially allowing for prevention of later onset hearing loss. This information could also be used to increase the effectiveness of genetic counseling regarding hearing impairment.\nMETHODS: A total of 9317 neonates from Children's Hospital of Dongguan and Dongguan People's Hospital were included in this study between January 2015 and October 2015. Twenty hotspot hearing-associated mutations of four common deafness- susceptibility genes (GJB2, GJB3, SLC26A4, and MTRNR1) were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). The results of genetic screening and NHS were concurrently analyzed.\nRESULTS: A total of 129 infants (1.38%) exhibited hearing loss as determined by otoacoustic emission (OAE) testing. The genetic screening revealed that 348 (3.74%) individuals had at least one mutant allele. In total, 34 (0.36%) of the neonates carried a causal complement of mutations. The overwhelming majority of the genetically referred newborns passed the OAE hearing screening, but could be at risk for later hearing loss.\nCONCLUSION: This study furthers the understanding of the etiology of hearing loss and proves that it is beneficial to use genetic screening along with OAE screening of neonates to improve detection rates of at-risk infants. Our results show that this concurrent testing allows for better early identification of infants at risk for hearing loss, which may occur before speech and language development. Prevention of hearing loss can be achieved by avoiding the use of antibiotics containing amino glycosides in infants whose mutations make them extremely sensitive to these antibiotics. This information is also useful in genetic counseling, providing region-specific mutation information.",

        "abstract": "The search for genes that can explain the development of autism is ongoing. At the same time, genetic counselling and genetic testing can be offered to families with a child diagnosed with autism. However, given the complexity of autism, both with respect to its aetiology as well as with respect to its heterogeneity, such genetic counselling and testing raises specific ethical questions regarding the aim and scope. In order to map these questions and opinions we interviewed 15 Belgian autism professionals. We found that they believed that genetic counselling and genetic testing have certain benefits for families confronted with an autism diagnosis, but also that direct benefit to the child is limited to those cases where a genetic finding offers a certain prognosis and intervention plan. In cases where autism is the result of a syndrome or a known genetic variant that is associated with other health problems, detection can also enable prevention of these health issues. Benefits of genetic testing, such as relief of guilt and reproductive choice, are primarily benefits to the parents, although indirectly they may affect the wellbeing of the person diagnosed. These benefits are associated with ethical questions.",

Information regarding knowledge of genetics, attitudes toward genetic testing, and sociodemographic data were collected using a self-administered questionnaire.\nRESULTS: In general, students had a good knowledge of genetics but lacked some fundamentals of genetics. The majority of students showed positive attitudes toward genetic testing, but some students showed negative attitudes toward certain aspects of genetic testing such as resorting to abortion in the case of an untreatable major genetic defect in an unborn fetus. The main significant predictors of knowledge were faculty, gender, academic year, and some prior awareness of 'genetic testing'. The main significant predictors of attitudes were gender, academic year, grade point average, and some prior awareness of 'genetic testing'.\nCONCLUSION: The knowledge of genetics among college students was higher than has been reported in other studies, and the attitudes toward genetic testing were fairly positive.

Recently, two large prospective studies and a real-life 5-year outcome study have been reported. We performed a pooled analysis of prospective European impact studies to generate robust data on impact of use in different clinical subgroups.\nMETHODS: The analysis included four studies (French, German, Spanish, and British) in ER+ human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative breast cancer patients (n\u00a0=\u00a0527). Node-positive patients were excluded.\nRESULTS: The analysis demonstrated that treatment recommendations changed in 32% of patients post-testing; chemotherapy recommendation rate decreased from 55% to 34%. Change rates in the individual studies ranged from 30% to 37%. The highest change rates were in patients originally recommended chemotherapy and in grade II tumours; there was no subgroup without a treatment recommendation change. Notably, 31% of patients with an intermediate Recurrence Score result had a treatment recommendation change suggesting that testing provides actionable information in this group. With the exception of the German study (where chemotherapy rates remained high [41%] post-testing), between-study variability in treatment recommendations decreased post-testing (chemotherapy: from 36-52% to 26-29%; hormonal therapy: from 48-64% to 71-74%). Physicians' confidence regarding treatment recommendations improved in all the studies after testing.\nCONCLUSION: Recurrence Score testing led to changes in adjuvant chemotherapy use in approximately a third of patients, to an overall reduced chemotherapy use, and to more homogeneous decision making.",

In non-polyposis patients with a cancer diagnosis, tumor testing for Lynch syndrome can guide the use of genetic testing. In patients without a personal history of cancer or polyposis, a carefully obtained family history with testing of available tumor tissue or of a living relative affected by colorectal cancer informs the need for genetic testing. Surveillance and surgical management should be planned following thorough assessment of familial cancer risk. Evidence exists to provide guidance as to the surveillance strategies required, the specific indications of genetic testing and the appropriate timing of operative intervention. A carefully obtained family history with selective genetic testing should inform surveillance and surgical management in patients who have a genetic predisposition for the development of colorectal cancer.",

Through the use of comprehensive whole genome genomic profiling by next-generation sequencing, an unprecedented bulk of data on driver mutations, key genomic rearrangements, and mechanisms on tumor evolution has been generated. These developments have marked the beginning of a new era in oncology called \"personalized or precision medicine.\" Elucidation of biologic mechanisms that underpin carcinogenetic potential and metastatic behavior has led to an inevitable explosion in the development of effective targeted agents, many of which have gained approval over the past decade. Despite energetic efforts and the enormous support gained within the oncology community, there are many obstacles in the clinical implementation of precision medicine. Other than the well-known biologic markers, such as ER and Her-2/neu, no proven predictive marker exists to determine the responsiveness to a certain biologic agent. One of the major issues in this regard is teasing driver mutations among the background noise within the bulk of coexisting passenger mutations. Improving bioinformatics tools through electronic models, enhanced by improved insight into pathway dependency may be the step forward to overcome this problem. Next, is the puzzle on spatial and temporal tumoral heterogeneity, which remains to be solved by ultra-deep sequencing and optimizing liquid biopsy techniques. Finally, there are multiple logistical and financial issues that have to be meticulously tackled in order to optimize the use of \"precision medicine\" in the real-life setting.",

Although logistic and economic limitations to clinical pharmacogenomics are being superseded by external measures such as preemptive genotyping, implementation by clinicians has met resistance, partly due to a lack of education. Pharmacists, with extensive training in pharmacology and pharmacotherapy and accessibility to patients, are ideally suited to champion clinical pharmacogenomics. This study aimed to analyze the outcomes of an innovative pharmacogenomic teaching approach. Second-year student pharmacists enrolled in a required, 15-week pharmaceutical care lab course in 2015 completed educational activities including lectures and small group work focusing on practical pharmacogenomics. Reflecting the current landscape of direct-to-consumer (DTC) genomic testing, students were offered 23andMe genotyping. Students completed surveys regarding their attitudes and confidence on pharmacogenomics prior to and following the educational intervention. Paired pre- and post-intervention responses were analyzed with McNemar's test for binary comparisons and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test for Likert items. Responses between genotyped and non-genotyped students were analyzed with Fisher's exact test for binary comparisons and the Mann-Whitney U-test for Likert items. Responses were analyzed for all student pharmacists who voluntarily completed the pre-intervention survey (N = 121, 83% response) and for student pharmacists who completed both pre- and post-intervention surveys (N = 39, 27% response). Of those who completed both pre- and post-intervention surveys, 59% obtained genotyping.

According to our respondents, such evaluation is necessary to ensure applicants are trustworthy, meet a certain level of expertise or experience and are aware of the rules and the associated concerns with genomic data sharing. The respondents noted, however, that the qualification criteria are fragmented or are poorly delineated at times. Thus, developing qualification criteria seems vital for an objective, fair and responsible access procedure. Similarly, the access review will benefit from using common ways of verifying the users' affiliations. Furthermore, some DAC members expressed concern over the uncertain oversight of downstream data use, in particular where data are shared across borders. DAC members and experts did not consider current sanctions and enforcement procedures to be crystal clear. Therefore, data sharing policies should address this gap by establishing proportionate sanctions both against data producers and data users' non-compliance. Users' home institutes will need to have an active role in keeping oversight on the downstream data uses, considering their ultimate responsibility if wrongdoings happen.",

        "abstract": "Molecular diagnosis of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) by standard methodologies has been limited to the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. With the recent development of new sequencing methodologies, the speed and efficiency of DNA testing have dramatically improved. The aim of this work was to validate the use of next-generation sequencing (NGS) for the detection of BRCA1/BRCA2 point mutations in a diagnostic setting and to study the role of other genes associated with HBOC in Portuguese families. A cohort of 94 high-risk families was included in the study, and they were initially screened for the two common founder mutations with variant-specific methods. Fourteen index patients were shown to carry the Portuguese founder mutation BRCA2 c.156_157insAlu, and the remaining 80 were analyzed in parallel by Sanger sequencing for the BRCA1/BRCA2 genes and by NGS for a panel of 17 genes that have been described as involved in predisposition to breast and/or ovarian cancer. A total of 506 variants in the BRCA1/BRCA2 genes were detected by both methodologies, with a 100\u00a0% concordance between them. This strategy allowed the detection of a total of 39 deleterious mutations in the 94 index patients, namely 10 in BRCA1 (25.6\u00a0%), 21 in BRCA2 (53.8\u00a0%), four in PALB2 (10.3\u00a0%), two in ATM (5.1\u00a0%), one in CHEK2 (2.6\u00a0%), and one in TP53 (2.6\u00a0%), with 20.5\u00a0% of the deleterious mutations being found in genes other than BRCA1/BRCA2. These results demonstrate the efficiency of NGS for the detection of BRCA1/BRCA2 point mutations and highlight the genetic heterogeneity of HBOC.",

        "abstract": "Little is known about the change in mammograms use by women after BRCA1/2 genetic testing. We compared the rate of bilateral mammograms after and prior to BRCA1/2 testing, according to test result. Information from the Quebec Health Insurance Board database was used to identify all registered mammograms delivered between May 1, 1998 and March 31, 2012 to a cohort of 396 unaffected French Canadian women tested for BRCA1/2 mutations. Mammograms incidence density ratios were calculated using the Cox proportional hazards model for repeated events. BRCA1/2 mutation carriers and women with an inconclusive result had more mammograms after, than prior to, genetic testing. Non-carriers did not receive more mammograms. The observed increase in mammography screening in BRCA1/2 carriers is consistent with the high risk of developing breast cancer in this group. The estimation of the cancer risk associated with an inconclusive result is based on familial cancer history, and women who received this result appear to have received follow-up as if at high risk. The fact that non-carriers did not change their use of mammograms after genetic testing may possibly reflect a 'defensive medicine' approach by some physicians or the women's preference.",

Although there is considerable literature on these issues, there is a dearth of literature chronicling approaches taken to address these issues in the field. Additionally no previous ethical guidelines have been developed to support similar research in Trinidad and Tobago.\nMETHODS: A literature review was undertaken to identify strategies used to address common ethical issues relevant to human genetics and genomics research in research-na\u00efve or resource-limited settings. Strategies identified were combined with novel approaches to develop a culturally appropriate, multifaceted strategy to address potential challenges in the Genetics Substudy of the National Eye Survey of Trinidad and Tobago (GSNESTT).\nRESULTS: Regarding the protection of study participants, we report a decision to exclude children as participants; the use of a Community Engagement and Sensitization Strategy to increase the genetic literacy of the target population; the involvement of local expertise to ensure cultural sensitivity and to address potential comprehension barriers in informed consent; and an audit of the informed consent process to ensure valid consent. Concerning the regulation of the research, we report on ethics approvals from relevant authorities; a Materials Transfer Agreement to guide sample ownership and export; and a Sample Governance Committee to oversee data use and data access. Finally regarding the protection of the interests of scientists from the host country, we report on capacity building efforts to ensure that local scientists have access to data collected through the project and appropriate recognition of their contributions in future publications.\nCONCLUSION: This paper outlines an ethical framework for the conduct of population-based genetics and genomics research in Trinidad and Tobago; highlights common issues arising in the field and strategies to address these.",

        "abstract": "Although consensus has yet to be reached on universal mismatch-repair (MMR) protein immunohistochemical (IHC) screening for Lynch syndrome (LS) in endometrial cancer (EC), an increasing number of institutions have adopted universal screening protocols similar to those used for colorectal carcinoma. Here we describe our institution's experience with a prospective universal screening protocol in which all ECs resected over a period of 19 months (n=242) were screened for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2, and MSH6 deficiencies using IHC, followed by MLH1 promoter methylation testing when appropriate. When consent was obtained, tumor samples underwent next-generation sequencing. A total of 11 unmethylated MMR-deficient cases (4.5% of cohort) were identified through IHC screening. Germline testing was performed in 10 cases and confirmed LS in 4 patients (1.7% of cohort). Of our 4 confirmed LS cases, 1 did not meet traditional LS screening criteria (eg, age below 50 y, Revised Bethesda criteria). In addition, universal screening identified 6 germline-negative MMR-deficient nonmethylated cases, 4 of which occurred in women older than 50. Although our next-generation sequencing data suggest somatic mutations in 4 of these cases, it is possible that these cases may represent cases of \"Lynch-like syndrome.\" We conclude that a subset of LS cases could be missed using traditional screening guidelines. The value of screening for Lynch-like syndrome has yet to be determined. Although the cost-effectiveness of universal screening in EC has yet to be elucidated, we conclude that universal IHC screening is currently a reasonable, and arguably superior, approach to screening for LS.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The 70-gene signature test (MammaPrint) has been shown to improve prediction of clinical outcome in women with early-stage breast cancer. We sought to provide prospective evidence of the clinical utility of the addition of the 70-gene signature to standard clinical-pathological criteria in selecting patients for adjuvant chemotherapy.\nMETHODS: In this randomized, phase 3 study, we enrolled 6693 women with early-stage breast cancer and determined their genomic risk (using the 70-gene signature) and their clinical risk (using a modified version of Adjuvant! Online). Women at low clinical and genomic risk did not receive chemotherapy, whereas those at high clinical and genomic risk did receive such therapy. In patients with discordant risk results, either the genomic risk or the clinical risk was used to determine the use of chemotherapy. The primary goal was to assess whether, among patients with high-risk clinical features and a low-risk gene-expression profile who did not receive chemotherapy, the lower boundary of the 95% confidence interval for the rate of 5-year survival without distant metastasis would be 92% (i.e., the noninferiority boundary) or higher.\nRESULTS: A total of 1550 patients (23.2%) were deemed to be at high clinical risk and low genomic risk. At 5 years, the rate of survival without distant metastasis in this group was 94.7% (95% confidence interval, 92.5 to 96.2) among those not receiving chemotherapy. The absolute difference in this survival rate between these patients and those who received chemotherapy was 1.5 percentage points, with the rate being lower without chemotherapy. Similar rates of survival without distant metastasis were reported in the subgroup of patients who had estrogen-receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative, and either node-negative or node-positive disease.\nCONCLUSIONS: Among women with early-stage breast cancer who were at high clinical risk and low genomic risk for recurrence, the receipt of no chemotherapy on the basis of the 70-gene signature led to a 5-year rate of survival without distant metastasis that was 1.5 percentage points lower than the rate with chemotherapy. Given these findings, approximately 46% of women with breast cancer who are at high clinical risk might not require chemotherapy.

        "title": "The Role of Genetic Testing in the Selection of Therapy for Breast Cancer: A Review.",
        "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: The application of next-generation sequencing (NGS) genomic testing for somatic mutations in breast oncology has been slower than anticipated due to issues with clinical applicability and natural heterogeneity of breast cancer. This review summarizes the state of the field and considers approaches for more effective implementation.\nOBSERVATIONS: While there is an emerging role for germline genetic testing potentially predicting sensitivity to platinum salts and PARP inhibitors, the data regarding somatic mutation for prediction of drug sensitivity remains controversial. Currently, there are no guidelines or regulatory approvals for genomic somatic tumor mutation testing to direct therapy. However, some small populations show promise, such as those with ERBB2/HER2 mutation who may represent the first population to have a positive drug somatic mutation match. Similarly, those with ESR1 mutation may be the first to emerge for a negative association with the efficacy of aromatase-inhibitor treatment. One of the barriers to progress is the necessary focus on metastatic disease, which is often challenging, expensive, and risky to biopsy. In addition, because of the clonal heterogeneity of advanced disease, a single sample may not contain all the genomic information necessary for treatment. Thus, circulating tumor DNA analysis is perhaps one of the most practical and promising approaches.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Circulating tumor DNA analysis, once sensitive and broad enough, will accelerate progress in the quest to make NGS technologies relevant to breast cancer treatment. A broad and coordinated coalition to systematically connect somatic mutations to clinical and pharmacologic data will be critical for progress. We recommend instituting an open source encyclopedia, which would serve as a reference for NGS sequencing report interpretation and would be available to all clinicians to help direct therapy.",

A valid instrument should be easily understood without extensive pretest counseling while still faithfully eliciting patients' preferences.\nMETHODS: We conducted focus groups with 110 adults to understand patient perspectives on secondary genomic findings and the role that preferences should play. We then developed and refined a draft instrument and used it to elicit preferences from parents participating in a genomic sequencing study in children with intellectual disabilities.\nRESULTS: Patients preferred filtering of secondary genomic results to avoid information overload and to avoid learning what the future holds, among other reasons. Patients preferred to make autonomous choices about which categories of results to receive and to have their choices applied automatically before results are returned to them and their clinicians. The Preferences Instrument for Genomic Secondary Results (PIGSR) is designed to be completed by patients or research participants without assistance and to guide bioinformatic analysis of genomic raw data. Most participants wanted to receive all secondary results, but a significant minority indicated other preferences.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our novel instrument-PIGSR-should be useful in a wide variety of clinical and research settings.Genet Med 19 3, 337-344.",

Although many will be sporadic, families where 3 first-degree relatives are affected can be considered to represent true familial non-medullary thyroid cancer (FNMTC). The genetic basis, impact on clinical and pathological features, and overall effect on prognosis are poorly understood.\nMETHODS: A literature review identified articles which report on genetic, clinical, therapeutic and screening aspects of FNMTC. The results are presented to allow an understanding of the genetic basis and the impact on clinical-pathological features and prognosis in order to inform clinical decision making.\nRESULTS: The genetic basis of FNMTC is unknown. Despite this, significant progress has been made in identifying potential susceptibility genes. The lack of a test for FNMTC has led to a clinical definition requiring a minimum of 3 first-degree relatives to be diagnosed with NMTC. Although some have shown an association with multi-centric disease, younger age and increased rates of extra-thyroidal extension and nodal metastases, these findings are not supported by all. The impact of FNMTC is unclear with all groups reporting good outcome, and some finding an association with more aggressive disease. The role of screening remains controversial.\nCONCLUSION: FNMTC is rare but can be diagnosed clinically. Its impact on prognostic factors and the subsequent role in influencing management is debated. For those patients who present with otherwise low-risk differentiated thyroid cancer, FNMTC should be included in risk assessment when discussing therapeutic options.",

Heterozygous loss of function mutations in CCM1/KRIT1, CCM2/MGC4607, and CCM3/PDCD10 genes are identified in about 90\u00a0% of familial cases of CCMs and two thirds of sporadic cases with multiple lesions. In this study, we performed genetic screening of a cohort of 31 patients, mainly pediatric. We analyzed the CCM1, CCM2, and CCM3 genes by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) and direct sequencing of exons and intronic boundaries. A total of 9 typical pathogenic loss-of-function mutations were identified in 10 out 31 patients (32\u00a0%). The 75\u00a0% of familial cases were mutated and the percentage reached to 85\u00a0% when we consider only pediatric cases. Detection rate in sporadic cases with multiple lesions was considerably lower (16\u00a0%). We identified a novel variant of CCM3, the c.130-131insT (p.R45Efs*8), in 1 pediatric sporadic case with multiple lesions that introduced a premature termination codon into the messenger RNA (mRNA), most likely leading to mRNA decay. Similar to other CCM pediatric series, the main symptoms associated to clinical debut consisted of cerebral hemorrhage. In conclusion, the penetrance of CCM mutations in familial pediatric cases is high (85\u00a0%). The genetic workup could improve clinical and genetic counseling in CCM patients.

We investigated the performance of the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC) risk model in combination with a polygenic risk score (PRS) comprised of 83 single nucleotide polymorphisms identified from genome-wide association studies. We conducted a nested case-control study of 486 cases and 495 matched controls within a screening cohort. The PRS was calculated using a Bayesian approach. The contributions of the PRS and variables in the BCSC model to breast cancer risk were tested using conditional logistic regression. Discriminatory accuracy of the models was compared using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Increasing quartiles of the PRS were positively associated with breast cancer risk, with OR 2.54 (95\u00a0% CI 1.69-3.82) for breast cancer in the highest versus lowest quartile. In a multivariable model, the PRS, family history, and breast density remained strong risk factors. The AUROC of the PRS was 0.60 (95\u00a0% CI 0.57-0.64), and an Asian-specific PRS had AUROC 0.64 (95\u00a0% CI 0.53-0.74).

Prospective assessment of the feasibility and limitations of using genomic sequencing is critically important.\nMETHODS: A prospective clinical study was conducted on 100 patients with diverse-histology, rare, or poor-prognosis cancers to evaluate the clinical actionability of a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified, comprehensive genomic profiling assay (FoundationOne), using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumors. The primary objectives were to assess utility, feasibility, and limitations of genomic sequencing for genomically guided therapy or other clinical purpose in the setting of a multidisciplinary molecular tumor board.\nRESULTS: Of the tumors from the 92 patients with sufficient tissue, 88 (96%) had at least one genomic alteration (average 3.6, range 0-10). Commonly altered pathways included p53 (46%), RAS/RAF/MAPK (rat sarcoma; rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma; mitogen-activated protein kinase) (45%), receptor tyrosine kinases/ligand (44%), PI3K/AKT/mTOR (phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase; protein kinase B; mammalian target of rapamycin) (35%), transcription factors/regulators (31%), and cell cycle regulators (30%). Many low frequency but potentially actionable alterations were identified in diverse histologies. Use of comprehensive profiling led to implementable clinical action in 35% of tumors with genomic alterations, including genomically guided therapy, diagnostic modification, and trigger for germline genetic testing.\nCONCLUSION: Use of targeted next-generation sequencing in the setting of an institutional molecular tumor board led to implementable clinical action in more than one third of patients with rare and poor-prognosis cancers. Major barriers to implementation of genomically guided therapy were clinical status of the patient and drug access. Early and serial sequencing in the clinical course and expanded access to genomically guided early-phase clinical trials and targeted agents may increase actionability.\nIMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Identification of key factors that facilitate use of genomic tumor testing results and implementation of genomically guided therapy may lead to enhanced benefit for patients with rare or difficult to treat cancers.

        "abstract": "Lung cancer diagnostics have progressed greatly in the previous decade. Development of molecular testing to identify an increasing number of potentially clinically actionable genetic variants, using smaller samples obtained via minimally invasive techniques, is a huge challenge. Tumour heterogeneity and cancer evolution in response to therapy means that repeat biopsies or circulating biomarkers are likely to be increasingly useful to adapt treatment as resistance develops. We highlight some of the current challenges faced in clinical practice for molecular testing of EGFR, ALK, and new biomarkers such as PDL1. Implementation of next generation sequencing platforms for molecular diagnostics in non-small-cell lung cancer is increasingly common, allowing testing of multiple genetic variants from a single sample. The use of next generation sequencing to recruit for molecularly stratified clinical trials is discussed in the context of the UK Stratified Medicine Programme and The UK National Lung Matrix Trial.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of the gradual implementation of HER2 testing on patient prognosis in a national registry of AGC.\nMETHODS: This Spanish National Cancer Registry includes cases who were consecutively recruited at 28 centers from January 2008 to January 2016. The effect of missing HER2 status was assessed using stratified Cox proportional hazards (PH) regression.\nRESULTS: The rate of HER2 testing increased steadily over time, from 58.3\u00a0% in 2008 to 92.9\u00a0% in 2016. HER2 was positive in 194 tumors (21.3\u00a0%). In the stratified Cox PH regression, each 1\u00a0% increase in patients who were not tested for HER2 at the institutions was associated with an approximately 0.3\u00a0% increase in the risk of death: hazard ratio, 1.0035 (CI 95\u00a0%, 1.001-1.005), P\u00a0=\u00a00.0019. Median OS was significantly lower at institutions with the highest proportions of patients who were not tested for HER2.\nCONCLUSION: Patients treated at centers that took longer to implement HER2 testing exhibited worse clinical outcomes. The speed of implementation behaves as a quality-of-care indicator. Reviewed guidelines on HER2 testing should be used to achieve this goal in a timely manner.",

In order to better explain the clinical and genetic heterogeneity in HCM patients, in this study, we implemented a target-next generation sequencing\u00a0(NGS) assay. An Ion\u00a0AmpliSeq\u2122 Custom Panel for the enrichment of 19\u00a0genes, of which 9\u00a0of these did not encode thick/intermediate and thin myofilament\u00a0(TTm) proteins and, among them, 3\u00a0responsible of HCM phenocopy, was created. Ninety-two DNA samples were analyzed by the Ion Personal Genome Machine: 73\u00a0DNA samples\u00a0(training set), previously genotyped in some of the genes by Sanger sequencing, were used to optimize the NGS strategy, whereas 19\u00a0DNA samples\u00a0(discovery set) allowed the evaluation of NGS performance. In the training set, we identified 72\u00a0out\u00a0of\u00a073 expected mutations and 15\u00a0additional mutations: the molecular diagnosis was achieved in one patient with a previously wild-type status and the pre-excitation syndrome was explained in another. In the discovery set, we identified 20\u00a0mutations, 5\u00a0of which were in genes encoding non-TTm proteins, increasing the diagnostic yield by approximately\u00a020%: a single mutation in genes encoding non-TTm proteins was identified in 2\u00a0out of 3\u00a0borderline HCM patients, whereas co-occuring mutations in genes encoding TTm and galactosidase\u00a0alpha\u00a0(GLA) altered proteins were characterized in a male with HCM and multiorgan dysfunction. Our combined targeted NGS-Sanger sequencing-based strategy allowed the molecular diagnosis of HCM with greater efficiency than using the conventional\u00a0(Sanger) sequencing alone. Mutant alleles encoding non-TTm proteins may aid in the complete understanding of the genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity of HCM: co-occuring mutations of genes encoding TTm and non-TTm proteins could explain the wide variability of the HCM phenotype, whereas mutations in genes encoding only the non-TTm proteins are identifiable in patients with a milder HCM status.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Whether oophorectomy reduces breast cancer risk among BRCA mutation carriers is a matter of debate. We undertook a prospective analysis of bilateral oophorectomy and breast cancer risk in BRCA mutation carriers.\nMETHODS: Subjects had no history of cancer, had both breasts intact, and had information on oophorectomy status (n\u2009=\u20093722). Women were followed until breast cancer diagnosis, prophylactic bilateral mastectomy, or death. A Cox regression model was used to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of breast cancer associated with oophorectomy (coded as a time-dependent variable). All statistical tests were two-sided.\nRESULTS: Over a mean follow-up of 5.6 years, 350 new breast cancers were diagnosed. Among women with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation, oophorectomy was not associated with breast cancer risk compared with women who did not undergo an oophorectomy. The age-adjusted hazard ratio associated with oophorectomy was 0.96 (95% CI\u2009=\u20090.73 to 1.26, P\u2009=\u200976) for BRCA1 and was 0.65 (95% CI\u2009=\u20090.37 to 1.16, P\u2009=\u200914) for BRCA2 mutation carriers. In stratified analyses, the effect of oophorectomy was statistically significant for breast cancer in BRCA2 mutation carriers diagnosed prior to age 50 years (age-adjusted HR\u2009=\u20090.18, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.05 to 0.63, P\u2009=\u2009007). Oophorectomy was not associated with risk of breast cancer prior to age 50 years among BRCA1 mutation carriers (age-adjusted HR\u2009=\u20090.79, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.55 to 1.13, P\u2009=\u200951).\nCONCLUSIONS: Findings from this large prospective study support a role of oophorectomy for the prevention of premenopausal breast cancer in BRCA2, but not BRCA1 mutation carriers.

Cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) plays a key role in the process of metabolizing tamoxifen to its active moiety, endoxifen. Patients with variants of the CYP2D6 gene may not receive the full benefit of tamoxifen treatment. The CYP2D6*10 variant (the most common variant in Asians) was analyzed to optimize the prescription of tamoxifen in China. To ensure referring clinicians have accurate information for genotype-guided tamoxifen treatment, the Chinese National Center for Clinical Laboratories (NCCL) organized a national proficiency testing (PT) to evaluate the performance of laboratories providing CYP2D6*10 genotyping. Ten genomic DNA samples with CYP2D6 wild-type or CYP2D6*10 variants were validated by PCR-sequencing and sent to 28 participant laboratories. The genotyping results and pharmacogenomic test reports were submitted and evaluated by NCCL experts. Additional information regarding the number of samples tested, the accreditation/certification status, and detecting technology was also requested. Thirty-one data sets were received, with a corresponding analytical sensitivity of 98.2% (548/558 challenges; 95% confidence interval: 96.7-99.1%) and an analytic specificity of 96.5% (675/682; 95% confidence interval: 97.9-99.5%). Overall, 25/28 participants correctly identified CYP2D6*10 status in 10 samples; however, two laboratories made serious genotyping errors. Most of the essential information was included in the 20 submitted CYP2D6*10 test reports. The majority of Chinese laboratories are reliable for detecting the CYP2D6*10 variant; however, several issues revealed in this study underline the importance of PT schemes in continued external assessment and provision of guidelines.",

        "abstract": "Health-care systems as well as legislators and society seem largely unprepared to face and manage the massive production of genetic risk information. Ethics committees and professional bodies usually do not involve the individuals directly concerned in defining guidelines for genetic risk communication. Therefore, they do not always reflect people's needs and preferences. We argue in this article that we currently experience a cultural shift in medicine where individuals' concerns and preferences regarding genetic risk information are playing a more significant role than before, and that this should have some normative implications. We are going toward a situation where individual citizens are approached as consumers by personal genomics companies [Prainsack: Account Res 2011;18:132-147]. In clinical and research contexts, individuals are also increasingly informed about their own responsibilities for counterbalancing their genetic risk by making individual health care and lifestyle choices. In this situation, communication of genetic risk information may rather be regulated like traffic and markets in which consumers' decision-making power has a fundamental role in the management and regulation of how a service should be provided, as well as in the creation of policy and legislation. We acknowledge that markets may be different depending on different genetic conditions. For example, genetic risk communication for rare diseases, where a close relationship with clinicians is of paramount significance, should be differently regulated than personal genetic profiles of complex diseases, where contributing risk factors related to lifestyle are modifiable by the individual.",

As a component of a clinical study by the Japan NIPT Consortium, genetic counseling was conducted for women who wished to receive NIPT, and a questionnaire concerning both NIPT and genetic counseling was given twice: once after pre-test counseling and again when test results were reported. The responses of 7292 women were analyzed. They expressed high satisfaction with the genetic counseling system of the NIPT Consortium (94%). The number of respondents who indicated that genetic counseling is necessary for NIPT increased over time. Furthermore, they highly valued genetic counseling provided by skilled clinicians, such as clinical geneticists or genetic counselors. The vast majority (90%) responded that there was sufficient opportunity to consider the test ahead of time. Meanwhile, women who received positive test results had a poor opinion and expressed a low-degree satisfaction. We confirmed that the pre-test genetic counseling that we conducted creates an opportunity for pregnant women to sufficiently consider prenatal testing, promotes its understanding and has possibilities to effectively facilitate informed decision making after adequate consideration. A more careful and thorough approach is considered to be necessary for women who received positive test results.",

We examined the reproductive impact of carrier result disclosure of NBS for CF.\nMETHODS: We surveyed mothers of carrier infants after NBS (Time 1) and 1 year later (Time 2) to ascertain intended and reported communication of their infants' carrier results to relatives, carrier testing for themselves/other children, and reproductive decisions. A sub-sample of mothers was also interviewed at Time 1 and Time 2.\nRESULTS: The response rate was 54%. A little more than half (55%) of mothers underwent carrier testing at Time 1; another 40% of those who intended to undergo testing at Time 1 underwent testing at Time 2. Carrier result communication to relatives was high (92%), but a majority of participants did not expect the results to influence family planning (65%). All interviewed mothers valued learning their infants' carrier results. Some underwent carrier testing and then shared results with family. Others did not use the results or used them in unintended ways.\nCONCLUSION: Although mothers valued learning carrier results from NBS, they reported moderate uptake of carrier testing and limited influence on family planning.

        "abstract": "To date, there are no reliable markers for predicting onset of schizophrenia in individuals at high risk (HR). Substantial promise is, however, shown by a variety of pattern classification approaches to neuroimaging data. Here, we examined the predictive accuracy of support vector machine (SVM) in later diagnosing schizophrenia, at a single-subject level, using a cohort of HR individuals drawn from multiply affected families and a combination of neuroanatomical, schizotypal and neurocognitive variables. Baseline structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), schizotypal and neurocognitive data from 17 HR subjects, who subsequently developed schizophrenia and a matched group of 17 HR subjects who did not make the transition, yet had psychotic symptoms, were included in the analysis. We employed recursive feature elimination (RFE), in a nested cross-validation scheme to identify the most significant predictors of disease transition and enhance diagnostic performance. Classification accuracy was 94% when a self-completed measure of schizotypy, a declarative memory test and structural MRI data were combined into a single learning algorithm; higher than when either quantitative measure was used alone. The discriminative neuroanatomical pattern involved gray matter volume differences in frontal, orbito-frontal and occipital lobe regions bilaterally as well as parts of the superior, medial temporal lobe and cerebellar regions. Our findings suggest that an early SVM-based prediction of schizophrenia is possible and can be improved by combining schizotypal and neurocognitive features with neuroanatomical variables. However, our predictive model needs to be tested by classifying a new, independent HR cohort in order to estimate its validity.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Direct-to-consumer personal genomic testing has the potential to influence health behaviors, including smoking. Critics of this testing highlight limited evidence to support positive behavioral benefits and caution that genomic results may provide false reassurance, leading to unhealthy behaviors. This study investigates interest in genetic risks of smoking-related diseases and changes in smoking behaviors among genomic testing consumers.\nMETHODS: From 2012 to 2013, a longitudinal series of web surveys was conducted. A total of 1464 customers of 23andMe and Pathway Genomics completed a survey prior to viewing genomic test results, of which 1002 participants provided data on smoking behaviors 6 months after receiving results.\nRESULTS: At baseline, 64% of participants were never smokers, 29% were former smokers, and 7% were current smokers. Most baseline current smokers were very interested in genetic risk results for lung cancer (65%) and heart disease (72%). For lung cancer, this interest was significantly greater than former (50% very interested) and never smokers (37% very interested) (p < .0001). Even though participants were interested in smoking-related disease genetic risks, 96% reported the same smoking status at baseline and 6-month follow-up. Importantly, only 1% (n = 13/916) of former and never smokers became current smokers at 6 months and 22% (n = 14/64) of current smokers reported quitting.\nCONCLUSIONS: Overall, smokers show a high level of interest in genetic risks of smoking-related illnesses. The experience of receiving direct-to-consumer genomic health risks does not appear to have obvious harms related to smoking behaviors, with some potential benefits.\nIMPLICATIONS: In the setting of ongoing controversy surrounding direct-to-consumer genomic testing, this study provides evidence that consumers are interested in genetic risk results of smoking-related diseases. Receiving genomic testing results does not lead to smoking initiation among never smokers or reinitiation among former smokers and may be associated with a higher quit rate among current smokers at 6-month follow-up than the general population. These findings ease concerns that direct-to-consumer genomic testing could lead to false reassurance and unhealthy behaviors related to smoking.",

Revman 5.3 was used to analyze the relationship between gene SNPs and MDWD in Han-Chinese subjects.\nRESULTS: We included 33 studies researching the impact of gene SNPs on MDWD in Han-Chinese subjects. CYP2C9 *3/*3, *1/*3 and *3 carriers needed a 72% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 62.0%-81.0%), 28% (22.0%-33.0%) and 26% (21.0%-32.0%) lower MDWD, respectively, than CYP2C9 *1/*1 carriers.

Seventeen pregnant women attending antenatal healthcare in Uppsala County, Sweden, who had access to the decision aid were interviewed. Eleven opted to use the decision aid and six did not. Data were analysed by systematic text condensation.\nRESULTS: Women appreciated the decision aid, as it was easily accessible; moreover, they emphasised the importance of a reliable source.

The National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines for testing to detect BRCA1/2 mutations include personal history (PH) variables such as age of 45\u00a0years or younger and a family history (FH) variables. Rates of FH documentation and overall rates of appropriate referral for genetic testing are low, ranging from about 30 to 60\u00a0%. The authors hypothesized that an upfront FH documentation and inclusion of a genetics counselor in a multidisciplinary clinic (MDC) setting would increase rates of appropriate referral for genetic testing.\nMETHODS: The study enrolled 609 consecutive women with non-metastatic BCa seen in consultation between June 2012 and December 2015 at a multidisciplinary clinic. Rates of FH documentation and referral for genetic testing to detect BRCA1/2 mutations were assessed before and after inclusion of a genetic counselor in the MDC.\nRESULTS: The rates of FH documentation and appropriate referral were 100 and 89\u00a0%, respectively. Half (50\u00a0%) of the patients had only FH-based indications for testing. All the patients with PH-based indications were referred. The inclusion of a genetic counselor significantly increased appropriate referral rates among those with only FH-based indications (62 vs. 92\u00a0%) and overall (80 vs. 96\u00a0%) (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001 for both).

Guidelines are available for variant classification; however, interpretation of these guidelines by laboratories and providers may differ and lead to conflicting reporting and, potentially, to inappropriate medical management. We describe conflicting variant interpretations between Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments-approved commercial clinical laboratories, as reported to the Prospective Registry of Multiplex Testing (PROMPT), an online genetic registry. Methods Clinical data and genetic testing results were gathered from 1,191 individuals tested for inherited cancer susceptibility and self-enrolled in PROMPT between September 2014 and October 2015. Overall, 518 participants (603 genetic variants) had a result interpreted by more than one laboratory, including at least one submitted to ClinVar, and these were used as the final cohort for the current analysis. Results Of the 603 variants, 221 (37%) were classified as a variant of uncertain significance (VUS), 191 (32%) as pathogenic, and 34 (6%) as benign. The interpretation differed among reporting laboratories for 155 (26%). Conflicting interpretations were most frequently reported for CHEK2 and ATM, followed by RAD51C, PALB2, BARD1, NBN, and BRIP1. Among all participants, 56 of 518 (11%) had a variant with conflicting interpretations ranging from pathogenic/likely pathogenic to VUS, a discrepancy that may alter medical management.

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: In the search to prevent hemorrhages associated with anticoagulant therapy, a major goal is to validate predictors of sensitivity to warfarin. However, previous studies in Colombia that included polymorphisms in the VKORC1 and CYP2C9 genes as predictors reported different algorithm performances to explain dose variations, and did not evaluate the prediction of sensitivity to warfarin.\u00a0\nOBJECTIVE: To determine the accuracy of the pharmacogenetic analysis, which includes the CYP2C9 *2 and *3 and VKORC1 1639G>A polymorphisms in predicting patients' sensitivity to warfarin at the Hospital Militar Central, a reference center for patients born in different parts of Colombia.\u00a0\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Demographic and clinical data were obtained from 130 patients with stable doses of warfarin for more than two months. Next, their genotypes were obtained through a melting curve analysis. After verifying the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium of the genotypes from the polymorphisms, a statistical analysis was done, which included multivariate and predictive approaches.\u00a0\nRESULTS: A pharmacogenetic model that explained 52.8% of dose variation (p<0.001) was built, which was only 4% above the performance resulting from the same data using the International Warfarin Pharmacogenetics Consortium algorithm. The model predicting the sensitivity achieved an accuracy of 77.8% and included age (p=0.003), polymorphisms *2 and *3 (p=0.002) and polymorphism 1639G>A (p<0.001) as predictors.\u00a0\nCONCLUSIONS: These results in a mixed population support the prediction of sensitivity to warfarin based on polymorphisms in VKORC1 and CYP2C9 as a valid approach in Colombian patients.",

        "abstract": "The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of a regional population-based genetic testing program on the incidence of ovarian cancer in West Pomerania. Between 1999 and 2010, a total of 37,552 women ages 35 to 70 were tested for three BRCA1 founder mutations at the outpatient genetics clinic of the Pomeranian Medical University in Szczecin, Poland. A total of 641 women were found to carry a mutation (1.7%) and of these, 220 had a prophylactic oophorectomy (34.3%). A total of 12 women had an occult cancer diagnosed at the time of prophylactic oophorectomy (5.5%). We estimate that 26 more ovarian cancers would have been diagnosed by January 2015 in the absence of these oophorectomies and that an additional 25 cancers will be prevented in the future (total 51). During this period, 1611 ovarian cancers were diagnosed in the region; therefore we estimate that approximately 1.6% of ovarian cancers were prevented between 1999 and 2015 by our genetic testing program. We conclude that the prophylactic oophorectomies performed between 1999 and 2010 as a result of widespread BRCA1 mutation testing have reduced the incidence of ovarian cancer in Pomerania by a small amount (about 1.6%), and that the impact of genetic testing will increase in the coming years.",

More efficient ways to deliver genetic counselling are therefore urgently needed. We now systematically offer group instead of standard individual counselling to patients with suspected Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer. Group sessions last 30\u00a0min. The first twenty consist of a presentation by the genetic counsellor, the next ten of a discussion involving a cancer geneticist and a psychologist. A short individual consultation ensues, where personal and family issues are addressed and consent obtained. Blood is drawn afterwards. Satisfaction and knowledge are evaluated. We report data for the Oct-2014-Aug-2015 period. 210 patients attended group counselling, up to eight simultaneously. We always fitted them within a 4-h time frame. Mean satisfaction score was 41/43.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The substantial technological advancements in next-generation sequencing (NGS), combined with dropping costs, have allowed for a swift diffusion of NGS applications in clinical settings. Although several commercial parties report to have broken the $1000 barrier for sequencing an entire human genome, a valid cost overview for NGS is currently lacking. This study provides a complete, transparent and up-to-date overview of the total costs of different NGS applications.\nMETHODS: Cost calculations for targeted gene panels (TGP), whole exome sequencing (WES) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) were based on the Illumina NextSeq500, HiSeq4000, and HiSeqX5 platforms, respectively. To anticipate future developments, sensitivity analyses are performed.\nRESULTS: Per-sample costs were \u20ac1669 for WGS, \u20ac 792 for WES and \u20ac333 for TGP. To reach the coveted $1000 genome, not only is the long-term and efficient use of the sequencing equipment needed, but also large reductions in capital costs and especially consumable costs are also required.\nCONCLUSIONS: WES and TGP are considerably lower-cost alternatives to WGS. However, this does not imply that these NGS approaches should be preferred in clinical practice, since this should be based on the tradeoff between costs and the expected clinical utility of the approach chosen. The results of the present study contribute to the evaluation of such tradeoffs.",

        "abstract": "Renal transplantation is the treatment of choice for the patients with end-stage renal failure. Genetic factors, among others, can influence variability in response to immunosuppressive drugs. Nowadays, due to restrictive health resources, the question arises whether routine pharmacogenetic analyses should be done in the renal transplant recipients or not. The aim of this literature review was to present the up-to-date information considering the economic feasibility of pharmacogenetic testing in patients subjected to renal transplantation. The organization United Network for Organ Sharing in the US estimated that total costs per renal transplant concerning these analyses were $334,300 in 2014. Pharmacogenetic testing prior to treatment initiation could be helpful to predict and assess treatment response and the risks for adverse drug reactions. This kind of testing before treatment initiation seems to be one of the most promising applications of pharmacokinetics. Although pharmacogenetic tests were found to be a cost-effective or cost-saving strategy in many cases, some authors represent another opinion. However, if the real costs of renal transplantation are recognized, the application of these tests in the standard daily practice could be considered more realistic, which additionally emphasizes the importance of future studies assessing their cost effectiveness.",

        "abstract": "As next-generation sequencing increases access to human genetic variation, the challenge of determining clinical significance of variants becomes ever more acute. Germline variants in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes can confer substantial lifetime risk of breast and ovarian cancer. Assessment of variant pathogenicity is a vital part of clinical genetic testing for these genes. A database of clinical observations of BRCA variants is a critical resource in that process. This article describes BRCA Share\u2122, a database created by a unique international alliance of academic centers and commercial testing laboratories. By integrating the content of the Universal Mutation Database generated by the French Unicancer Genetic Group with the testing results of two large commercial laboratories, Quest Diagnostics and Laboratory Corporation of America (LabCorp), BRCA Share\u2122 has assembled one of the largest publicly accessible collections of BRCA variants currently available. Although access is available to academic researchers without charge, commercial participants in the project are required to pay a support fee and contribute their data. The fees fund the ongoing curation effort, as well as planned experiments to functionally characterize variants of uncertain significance. BRCA Share\u2122 databases can therefore be considered as models of successful data sharing between private companies and the academic world.",

        "abstract": "Mental disorders represent a major public health burden worldwide. This is likely to rise in the next decade, with the highest increases predicted to occur in low- and middle-income countries. Current psychotropic medication treatment guidelines focus on uniform approaches to the treatment of heterogeneous disorders and achieve only partial therapeutic success. Developing a global precision medicine approach in psychiatry appears attractive, given the value of this approach in other fields of medicine, such as oncology and infectious diseases. In this horizon scanning analysis, we review the salient opportunities and challenges for precision medicine in psychiatry over the next decade. Variants within numerous genes involved in a range of pathways have been implicated in psychotropic drug response and might ultimately be used to guide choice of pharmacotherapy. Multipronged approaches such as multi-omics (genomics, proteomics, metabolomics) analyses and systems diagnostics together with high-throughput sequencing and genotyping technologies hold promise for identifying precise and targeted treatments in mental disorders. To date, however, the vast majority of pharmacogenomics work has been undertaken in high-income countries on a relatively small proportion of the global population, and many other challenges face the field. Opportunities and challenges for establishing a global roadmap for precision medicine in psychiatry are discussed in this article.",

        "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a blood disease caused by a single nucleotide substitution (T > A) in the beta globin gene on chromosome 11. The single point mutation (Glu6Val) promotes polymerization of hemoglobin S (HbS) and causes sickling of erythrocytes. Vaso-occlusive painful crises are associated with recurrent and long-term use of analgesics/opioids and hydroxyurea (HU) by people living with SCD. The present analysis offers a state-of-the-art expert review of the effectiveness of pharmacogenomics/genetics of pain management in SCD, with specific focus on HU and opioids. The literature search used the following keywords: SCD, pharmacogenomics, pharmacogenetics, pain, antalgics, opioids, morphine, and HU. The literature was scanned until March 2016, with specific inclusion of targeted landmark and background articles on SCD. Surprisingly, our review identified only a limited number of studies that addressed the genetic/genomic basis of variable responses to pain (e.g., variants in OPRM1, HMOX-1, GCH1, VEGFA COMT genes), and pharmacogenomics of antalgics and opioids (e.g., variants in OPRM1, STAT6, ABCB1, and COMT genes) in SCD. There has been greater progress made toward identifying the key genomic variants, mainly in BCL11A, HBS1L-MYB, or SAR1, which contribute to response to HU treatment. However, the complete picture on pharmacogenomic determinants of the above therapeutic phenotypes remains elusive. Strikingly, no study has been conducted in sub-Saharan Africa where majority of the patients with SCD live. This alerts the broader global life sciences community toward the existing disparities in optimal and ethical targeting of research and innovation investments for SCD specifically and precision medicine and pharmacology research broadly.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This guideline was written to update Canadian maternity care and reproductive healthcare providers on pre- and postconceptional reproductive carrier screening for women or couples who may be at risk of being carriers for autosomal recessive (AR), autosomal dominant (AD), or X-linked (XL) conditions, with risk of transmission to the fetus. Four previous SOGC- Canadian College of Medical Geneticists (CCMG) guidelines are updated and merged into the current document.\nINTENDED USERS: All maternity care (most responsible health provider [MRHP]) and paediatric providers; maternity nursing; nurse practitioner; provincial maternity care administrator; medical student; and postgraduate resident year 1-7.\nTARGET POPULATION: Fertile, sexually active females and their fertile, sexually active male partners who are either planning a pregnancy or are pregnant (preferably in the first trimester of pregnancy, but any gestational age is acceptable).\nOPTIONS: Women and their partners will be able to obtain appropriate genetic carrier screening information and possible diagnosis of AR, AD, or XL disorders (preferably pre-conception), thereby allowing an informed choice regarding genetic carrier screening and reproductive options (e.g., prenatal diagnosis, preimplantation genetic diagnosis, egg or sperm donation, or adoption).\nOUTCOMES: Informed reproductive decisions related to genetic carrier screening and reproductive outcomes based on family history, ethnic background, past obstetrical history, known carrier status, or genetic diagnosis. SOGC REPRODUCTIVE CARRIER SCREENING SUMMARY STATEMENT (2016): Pre-conception or prenatal education and counselling for reproductive carrier screening requires a discussion about testing within the three perinatal genetic carrier screening/diagnosis time periods, which include pre-conception, prenatal, and neonatal for conditions currently being screened for and diagnosed. This new information should be added to the standard reproductive carrier screening protocols that are already being utilized by the most responsible maternity provider through the informed consent process with the patient. (III-A; GRADE low/moderate) SOGC OVERVIEW OF RECOMMENDATIONS QUALITY AND GRADE: There was a strong observational/expert opinion (quality and grade) for the genetic carrier literature with randomized controlled trial evidence being available only for the invasive testing. Both the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care quality and classification and the GRADE evidence quality and grade are provided.\nEVIDENCE: MEDLINE; PubMed; government neonatal screening websites; key words/common reproductive genetic carrier screened diseases/previous SOGC Guidelines/medical academic societies (Society of Maternal-Fetal Medicine [SMFM]; American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics; American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists [ACOG]; CCMG; Royal College Obstetrics and Gynaecology [RCOG] [UK]; American Society of Human Genetics [ASHG]; International Society of Prenatal Diagnosis [ISPD])/provincial neonatal screening policies and programs; search terms (carrier screening, prenatal screening, neonatal genetic/metabolic screening, cystic fibrosis (CF), thalassemia, hemoglobinopathy, hemophilia, Fragile X syndrome (FXS), spinal muscular atrophy, Ashkenazi Jewish carrier screening, genetic carrier screening protocols, AR, AD, XL).\nSEARCH PERIOD: 10 years (June 2005-September 2015); initial search dates June 30, 2015 and September 15, 2015; completed final search January 4,\u00a02016. Validation of articles was completed by primary authors RD Wilson and I De Bie.\nBENEFITS, HARMS, AND COST: Benefits are to provide an evidenced based reproductive genetic carrier screening update consensus based on international opinions and publications for the use of Canadian women, who are planning a pregnancy or who are pregnant and have been identified to be at risk (personal or male partner family or reproductive history) for the transmission of a clinically significant genetic condition to their offspring with associated morbidity and/or mortality. Harm may arise from having counselling and informed testing of the carrier status of the mother, their partner, or their fetus, as well as from declining to have this counselling and informed testing or from not having the opportunity for counselling and informed testing. Costs will ensue both from the provision of opportunities for counselling and testing, as well as when no such opportunities are offered or are declined and the birth of a child with a significant inherited condition and resulting morbidity/mortality occurs; these comprise not only the health care costs to the system but also the social/financial/psychological/emotional costs to the family. These recommendations are based on expert opinion and have not been subjected to a health economics assessment and local or provincial implementation will be required.\nGUIDELINE UPDATE: This guideline is an update of four previous joint SOGC-CCMG Genetic Screening Guidelines dated 2002, 2006, 2008, and 2008 developed by the SOGC Genetic Committee in collaboration with the CCMG Prenatal Diagnosis Committee (now Clinical Practice Committee). 2016 CARRIER SCREENING RECOMMENDATIONS.",

Only limited research has been done to identify the psychological factors associated with the decision for RRM. This study investigated which psychological factors are related to the intention to choose for RRM.\nMATERIALS & METHODS: A cohort of 486 cancer-unaffected women with a family history of breast cancer completed the following questionnaires prior to genetic counseling: the Cancer Worry Scale, Positive And Negative Affect Scale, Perceived Personal Control Scale, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and State Anxiety Scale and questions regarding socio-demographic characteristics, family history, risk perception and RRM intention. Multivariate logistic regression was used to analyze the relation between psychological factors and women's intention to choose for RRM.\nRESULTS: Factors associated with RRM intention were high positive affect (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.86, 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a01.12-3.08), high negative affect (OR\u00a0=\u00a02.52, 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a01.44-4.43), high cancer worry (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.65, 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a01.00-2.72), high perceived personal control (OR\u00a0=\u00a03.58, 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a02.18-5.89), high risk-perception (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.85, 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a01.15-2.95) and having children (OR\u00a0=\u00a02.06, 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a01.21-3.50).\nCONCLUSION: Negative and positive affects play an important role in the intention for RRM. Furthermore, perceived personal control over the situation is associated with an intention for RRM. In addition to focusing on accurate risk communication, counseling should pay attention to the influence of perceived control and emotions to facilitate decision-making.",

These include the Oncotype DX\u00ae Breast Recurrence Score\u2122 assay, MammaPrint\u00ae, Prosigna\u00ae, and EndoPredict\u00ae. Although these assays are similar in that they are all multigene assays reflecting risk of recurrence, they differ substantially in the technological platform used to measure gene expression; the number and identity of genes assessed; the patient populations used for development and validation; and the level of evidence supporting clinical utility. They also differ in the amount of evidence demonstrating their impact on treatment decisions and cost effectiveness in different countries. This review discusses these 4 assays, highlighting the clinical evidence that supports each of them, while focussing on the Recurrence Score assay. This assay has the greatest body of evidence supporting its clinical utility and decision impact/effectiveness, and currently is the only one validated as a predictor of response to adjuvant chemotherapy in hormone-receptor positive early BC patients treated with endocrine therapy and to be included as such in international/national BC treatment guidelines.

Patients' TPMT enzyme activities were classified as normal (26-50\u2009pmol/h/mgHb), intermediate (10-25\u2009pmol/h/mgHb), and deficient (<10\u2009pmol/h/mgHb).

They were all subsequently commenced on azathioprine. Erythrocyte TPMT activities were 14-76 (median 33.7) pmol/h/mgHb with 88% and 12% of patient having normal and intermediate activity respectively (none were deficient). The initial prescribed dosage of azathioprine was 0.7-3.5 (median 2.0) mg/kg/day.

The global precision medicine ecosystem is, thus, receiving generous support from the United States ($215 million), and numerous other governments have followed suit. In the context of precision medicine, drug treatment and prediction of its outcomes have been important for nearly six decades in the field of pharmacogenomics. The field offers an elegant solution for minimizing the effects and occurrence of adverse drug reactions (ADRs). The Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) plays an important role in this context, and it aims at specifically guiding the translation of clinically relevant and evidence-based pharmacogenomics research. In this forward-looking analysis, we make particular reference to several of the CPIC guidelines and their role in guiding the treatment of highly relevant diseases, namely cardiovascular disease, major depressive disorder, cancer, and human immunodeficiency virus, with a view to predicting and managing ADRs. In addition, we provide a list of the top 10 crosscutting opportunities and challenges facing the fields of precision medicine and pharmacogenomics, which have broad applicability independent of the drug class involved. Many of these opportunities and challenges pertain to infrastructure, study design, policy, and science culture in the early 21st century.

Data were summarized and compared using descriptive statistics.\nRESULTS: A total of 87 responses were collected, for a response rate of 60% (87 of 145). The majority of urologists reported that they always collect family history when discussing risk (95%) or screening (87%), and recommended earlier screening for men with family history of PC in comparison with men with no family history. Although only 57% reported always collecting family history when discussing treatment, the majority of respondents reported that a positive family history influenced their treatment recommendations. Eight percent of urologists would recommend prostatectomy for men diagnosed with low-grade, low-risk PC and no family history of PC vs 52% who would recommend the same course of treatment when the patient had at least 1 first-degree relative who died of the disease.

No differences in PCS interest were found between women and men (P = 0.091), but a higher proportion of women were concerned about negative consequences (53% versus 46%, P < 0.003) and were 'opposed to such a way of child selection' (31.8% versus 25.2%, P = 0.002). Factors associated with PCS interest were experiences of prenatal diagnostics and positive attitudes towards finding out or choosing sex of one's child (women), and prenatal diagnostics, self-rated poor health, and pregnancy planning (men).\nCONCLUSION: Both women and men had relatively high uncertainty towards PCS, but women were more concerned about negative consequences. The future extent of the clinical utility of PCS is currently unknown, but parents' interests and doubts are important aspects to consider.",

        "abstract": "Ever since genetic testing is possible for specific mutations, ethical debate has sparked on the question of whether professionals have a duty to warn not only patients but also their relatives that might be at risk for hereditary diseases. As next-generation sequencing (NGS) swiftly finds its way into clinical practice, the question who is responsible for conveying unsolicited findings to family members becomes increasingly urgent. Traditionally, there is a strong emphasis on the duties of the professional in this debate. But what is the role of the patient and her family? In this article, we discuss the question of whose duty it is to convey relevant genetic risk information concerning hereditary diseases that can be cured or prevented to the relatives of patients undergoing NGS. We argue in favor of a shared responsibility for professionals and patients and present a strategy that reconciles these roles: a moral accountability nudge. Incorporated into informed consent and counseling services such as letters and online tools, this nudge aims to create awareness on specific patient responsibilities. Commitment of all parties is needed to ensure adequate dissemination of results in the NGS era.",

        "abstract": "High-throughput next-generation sequencing such as whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing are being rapidly integrated into clinical practice. The use of these techniques leads to the identification of secondary variants for which decisions about the reporting or not to the patient need to be made. The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics recently published recommendations for the reporting of these variants in clinical practice for 56 \"actionable\" genes. Among these, seven are involved in Marfan Syndrome And Related Disorders (MSARD) resulting from mutations of the FBN1, TGFBR1 and 2, ACTA2, SMAD3, MYH11 and MYLK genes. Here, we show that mutations collected in UMD databases for MSARD genes (UMD-MSARD) are rarely reported, including the most frequent ones, in global scale initiatives for variant annotation such as the NHLBI GO Exome Sequencing Project (ESP), the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC), and ClinVar. The predicted pathogenic mutations reported in global scale initiatives but absent in locus-specific databases (LSDBs) mainly correspond to rare events. UMD-MSARD databases are therefore the only resources providing access to the full spectrum of known pathogenic mutations. They are the most comprehensive resources for clinicians and geneticists to interpret MSARD-related variations not only primary variants but also secondary variants.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of a pancreatic cyst as mucinous or high-risk dictates the need for follow-up or surgery. Molecular analysis of aspirated pancreatic cyst fluid (PCF) can provide valuable information not obtained by carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) analysis or cytology.\nMETHODS: All patients who underwent molecular analysis of PCF between March 2013 and June 2015 were reviewed, including pathology, imaging, and follow-up. Molecular testing was performed using a patented, anchored multiplex polymerase chain reaction next-generation sequencing (NGS) platform, which sequenced numerous hotspots in 39 genes linked with malignancy. Performance of NGS and cytology was calculated using final outcome, as determined by clinicopathologic follow-up.\nRESULTS: The study cohort included 113 PCFs from 105 patients. In total, 119 variants were detected in 67 PCFs (59%). Variants were more common in intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs)/cancer than in nonmucinous cysts (P\u2009<\u2009.005). The inclusion of v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS)/guanine nucleotide-binding protein (GNAS) variants improved the classification of IPMNs as mucinous from 50% by microscopy to 100%. Seventy-five percent of cancers had high-grade atypia versus 0% of IPMNs and nonmucinous cysts (P\u2009<\u2009.002). Variants in tumor protein 53 (TP53), SMAD family member 4 (SMAD4), cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A), and notch1 (NOTCH1) were detected only in malignant cysts. Cytology was similarly specific (100%) for detecting malignant cysts but was more sensitive than the identification of late mutations by NGS (75% vs 46%).\nCONCLUSIONS: The detection of KRAS/GNAS variants improves the identification of mucinous neoplasms. Variants in TP53, SMAD4, CDKN2A, and NOTCH1 support the diagnosis of a high-risk cyst requiring surgery or additional sampling. Although molecular analysis is not a replacement for cytopathology, it does provide valuable information for accurate preoperative diagnosis, helping to classify mucinous neoplasms and high-risk cysts that require surgical resection.

        "abstract": "Advances in human genetics have identified a significant number of genetic disorders associated with intellectual disability. As a result, appropriate clinical management of these affected individuals and their family members have become critical in addressing medical needs to improve quality of life. We examine the importance of a Fragile X Clinic for individuals with fragile X syndrome (FXS) and their family members by conducting a retrospective chart review of 123 new patients with FXS evaluated at the Fragile X Clinic at Emory University. After the initial diagnosis of a proband with FXS with cascade testing, there were 345 family members identified with a mutation (70% with premutations; 30% with full mutations). In terms of the impact of the clinic visit, males had a substantial number of new diagnoses in all behavioral disorders (P\u2009<\u20090.001), with anxiety (62%) being the most common. For female probands, the most frequent diagnosis was also anxiety (87%). Prior to the clinic visit, very few patients were prescribed psychotropic medications. After the clinic visit, the most frequently prescribed psychotropic medications for males were stimulants (41%; P\u2009<\u20090.001) and SSRIs (40%; P\u2009<\u20090.001). For females, only stimulants (33%; P\u2009=\u20090.03) and SSRIs (44%; P\u2009=\u20090.008) were statistically significantly prescribed. Our results revealed that there is a gap in care to address the co-morbid behavioral issues, psychopharmacologic medication management, and genetic counseling needs regarding FXS. A multidisciplinary setting and approach, such as that offered by a Fragile X Clinic, is one method of treating the complex needs of patients with FXS. \u00a9 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

        "abstract": "Erythrocytosis is a rare disorder characterized by increased red cell mass and elevated hemoglobin concentration and hematocrit. Several genetic variants have been identified as causes for erythrocytosis in genes belonging to different pathways including oxygen sensing, erythropoiesis and oxygen transport. However, despite clinical investigation and screening for these mutations, the cause of disease cannot be found in a considerable number of patients, who are classified as having idiopathic erythrocytosis. In this study, we developed a targeted next-generation sequencing panel encompassing the exonic regions of 21 genes from relevant pathways (~79 Kb) and sequenced 125 patients with idiopathic erythrocytosis. The panel effectively screened 97% of coding regions of these genes, with an average coverage of 450\u00d7. It identified 51 different rare variants, all leading to alterations of protein sequence, with 57 out of 125 cases (45.6%) having at least one of these variants. Ten of these were known erythrocytosis-causing variants, which had been missed following existing diagnostic algorithms. Twenty-two were novel variants in erythrocytosis-associated genes (EGLN1, EPAS1, VHL, BPGM, JAK2, SH2B3) and in novel genes included in the panel (e.g. EPO, EGLN2, HIF3A, OS9), some with a high likelihood of functionality, for which future segregation, functional and replication studies will be useful to provide further evidence for causality. The rest were classified as polymorphisms. Overall, these results demonstrate the benefits of using a gene panel rather than existing methods in which focused genetic screening is performed depending on biochemical measurements: the gene panel improves diagnostic accuracy and provides the opportunity for discovery of novel variants.",

        "abstract": "Inherited methylation disorders are a group of rarely reported, probably largely underdiagnosed disorders affecting transmethylation processes in the metabolic pathway between methionine and homocysteine. These are methionine adenosyltransferase I/III, glycine N-methyltransferase, S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase and adenosine kinase deficiencies. This paper provides the first consensus recommendations for the diagnosis and management of methylation disorders. Following search of the literature and evaluation according to the SIGN-methodology of all reported patients with methylation defects, graded recommendations are provided in a structured way comprising diagnosis (clinical presentation, biochemical abnormalities, differential diagnosis, newborn screening, prenatal diagnosis), therapy and follow-up. Methylation disorders predominantly affect the liver, central nervous system and muscles, but clinical presentation can vary considerably between and within disorders. Although isolated hypermethioninemia is the biochemical hallmark of this group of disorders, it is not always present, especially in early infancy. Plasma S-adenosylmethionine and S-adenosylhomocysteine are key metabolites for the biochemical clarification of isolated hypermethioninemia. Mild hyperhomocysteinemia can be present in all methylation disorders. Methylation disorders do not qualify as primary targets of newborn screening. A low-methionine diet can be beneficial in patients with methionine adenosyltransferase I/III deficiency if plasma methionine concentrations exceed 800\u00a0\u03bcmol/L. There is some evidence that this diet may also be beneficial in patients with S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase and adenosine kinase deficiencies. S-adenosylmethionine supplementation may be useful in patients with methionine adenosyltransferase I/III deficiency. Recommendations given in this article are based on general principles and in practice should be adjusted individually according to patient's age, severity of the disease, clinical and laboratory findings.",

        "abstract": "With a population of 1.4 billion, China shares the largest burden of rare genetic diseases worldwide. Current estimates suggest that there are over ten million individuals afflicted with chromosome disease syndromes and well over one million individuals with monogenic disease. Care of patients with rare genetic diseases remains a largely unmet need due to the paucity of available and affordable treatments. Over recent years, there is increasing recognition of the need for affirmative action by government, health providers, clinicians and patients. The advent of new next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies such as whole genome/exome sequencing, offers an unprecedented opportunity to provide large-scale population screening of the Chinese population to identify the molecular causes of rare genetic diseases. As a surrogate for lack of effective treatments, recent development and implementation of noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) in China has the greatest potential, as a single technology, for reducing the number of children born with rare genetic diseases.",

However, uncertainty exists around the optimal dosage, treatment duration and whether the benefits of aspirin as a risk-reducing medication (RRM) outweigh adverse medication related side-effects. Little is known about clinicians' attitudes, current practice, and perceived barriers to recommending aspirin as a RRM. To explore the attitudes of clinicians who discuss risk management options with patients with Lynch Syndrome towards using aspirin as a RRM. Clinicians were invited through professional organisations to complete an online survey. Topics included their clinical experience with Lynch Syndrome, views and practice of recommending aspirin as a RRM, and knowledge about clinical risk management guidelines for Lynch Syndrome. Comparison of attitudes was made between three professional groups. 181 respondents were included in the analysis: 59 genetics professionals (genetic counsellors and clinical geneticists, medical oncologists with specialist training in familial cancer), 49 gastroenterologists and 73 colorectal surgeons. Most clinicians (76\u00a0%) considered aspirin to be an effective RRM and most (72\u00a0%) were confident about discussing it. In all professional categories, those who were confident about discussing aspirin with patients perceived it to be an effective RRM (OR\u00a0=\u00a02.8 [95\u00a0%\u00a0CI\u00a0=\u00a01.8-4.2], p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Eighty percent (47/59) of genetics professionals reported having discussed the use of aspirin with Lynch Syndrome patients compared to 69\u00a0% of gastroenterologists and 68\u00a0% of colorectal surgeons. Those who considered aspirin as an effective RRM or who felt confident in their knowledge of the aspirin literature were more likely (OR\u00a0=\u00a010 [95\u00a0%\u00a0CI\u00a0=\u00a01.5-65], p\u00a0=\u00a00.010, OR\u00a0=\u00a06 [95\u00a0%\u00a0CI\u00a0=\u00a02.2-16], p\u00a0<\u00a00.001, respectively) to discuss it with their patients than other professionals in the study.

The group was deliberately multidisciplinary to ensure that a diversity of views was represented. This report outlines the main ethical issues, areas of best practice and principles underlying ethical clinically based genomic research discussed during the meeting. The main point emerging from the discussion is that ethical principles, rather than being formulaic, should guide researchers/clinicians to identify who the main stakeholders are to consult with for a specific project and to incorporate their voices/views strategically throughout the lifecycle of each project.

Clinical FH was assessed using both the Dutch Lipid Clinic Network (DLCN) criteria and the Simon Broome criteria.\nRESULTS: Based on the DLCN criteria, 2.0% of patients with first MI had \"probable/definite\" FH, whereas 4.7% had \"possible\" FH according to the Simon Broome criteria. In the 291 (21%) patients with premature MI, 6.9% had \"probable/definite\" FH (DLCN criteria), and 11.0% had \"possible\" FH (Simon Broome criteria). Nearly all premature \"probable/definite\" and \"possible\" FH patients had at least one additional marker of high cardiovascular risk including current smoking (72%-80%) and hypertension (40%-44%). In multivariable-adjusted linear regression modeling, patients with \"probable/definite\" FH using DLCN criteria had their first MI 14.6\u00a0years (95% confidence interval [CI], 9.6-19.6\u00a0years) earlier than non-FH patients. Likewise, \"possible\" FH patients using Simon Broome criteria were associated with having an MI 9.1\u00a0years (95% CI\u00a0= 6.3-12.4) earlier than non-FH patients.\nCONCLUSION: Clinical FH is common and associated with markedly earlier age of first MI, especially when combined with additional markers of high risk, indicating an unmet need for earlier identification of FH to ensure global risk factor control.

Patients with FH have a very high lifetime risk of cardiovascular disease, but FH often goes unrecognized in clinical care. New treatments including PCSK9 inhibitors are now available for this population, and the use of the electronic record may be able to help identify potential patients for therapy.\nOBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to determine the period prevalence of FH in a large ambulatory care population, including the homozygous form. In addition, use of cholesterol lowering therapy in individuals with FH was characterized.\nMETHODS: A retrospective analysis was carried out among patients seen in an upper Midwest health care system between 2009 and 2012. In a search of electronic health records (EHR) and using the current National Lipid Association guidelines, FH patients (including homozygous cases) were identified based on age and highest LDL-C. Statin therapy was characterized according to current FH treatment guidelines.\nRESULTS: There were 391,166 individuals with available measures during the study timeframe. Of these, 841 were identified as having probable HeFH, representing a prevalence of 0.21% (about 1 in 470 patients) in this population. HoFH was identified as probable in 6 patients. For the total group, two-thirds of FH patients were on a statin, but only half were treated adequately. The remaining one-third of FH patients were not on statin therapy, with only 27% of those not on statin therapy having a documented statin intolerance.\nCONCLUSIONS: FH is often underdiagnosed and suboptimally treated in clinical practice. Statin therapy in this population rarely went beyond low-moderate doses. These findings support EHR-based population health efforts to initiate an FH cascade-screening model and ensure higher quality care for this high-risk population and identify those who may benefit from advanced therapy.",

Little is known about how HCPs handle these test requests, given that guidelines recommend such testing is deferred to adulthood unless there is medical benefit to testing before that time. Our study explored the process of decision-making between HCPs and parents. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 34 HCPs in 8 regional genetic services across the UK, and data were thematically analysed. We found that instead of saying 'yes' or 'no' to such requests, many HCPs framed the consultation as an opportunity to negotiate the optimal time of testing. This, they argued, facilitates parents' considered decision-making, since parents' eventual decisions after requesting a test was often to defer testing their child. In cases where parents' requests remained a sustained wish, most HCPs said they would agree to test, concluding that not testing would not serve the child's wider best interest. As a strategy for determining the child's best interest and for facilitating shared decision-making, we recommend that HCPs re-frame requests for testing from parents as a discussion about the optimal time of testing for adult-onset disease.",

Analyses predicting the number of alcohol dependence symptoms were path models.\nRESULTS: Alcohol dependence symptoms were associated with a stronger family history of alcoholism and later generational status. There was a significant interaction effect between familial alcoholism and generational status; the relationship of familial alcoholism with alcohol dependence symptoms increased significantly with successive generations in the United States, more strongly in women than men. Acculturation partially mediated the interaction effect between familial alcoholism and generational status on alcohol dependence, although not in the expected direction.\nCONCLUSIONS: Familial alcoholism interacted with generational status in predicting alcohol dependence symptoms in US Hispanic drinkers.

Despite this, are we really moving towards such extended screening practice in reality?\nMETHODS: Data were analysed from four consecutive UK National External Quality Assessment Service for Molecular Genetics Colorectal cancer External Quality Assessment schemes (during the period 2014-2016), with up to 110 laboratories (worldwide) participating in each scheme. Testing of four or five tumour samples is required per scheme. Laboratories provided information on which codons were routinely screened, and provided genotyping and interpretation results for each sample.\nRESULTS: At least 85% of laboratories routinely tested KRAS codons 12, 13 and 61. Over the four schemes, an increasing number of laboratories routinely tested KRAS codons 59, 117 and 146. Furthermore, more laboratories were introducing next generation sequencing technologies. The pattern of 'extended testing' was reassuringly similar for NRAS, although fewer laboratories currently test for mutations in this gene. Alarmingly, still only 36.1% and 24.1% of participating laboratories met the ACP Molecular Pathology and Diagnostics Group and American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines, respectively, for extended RAS testing in the latest assessment.\nCONCLUSIONS: Despite recommendations in the UK and USA on extended RAS testing, there has clearly been, based on these results, a delay in implementation. Inadequate testing results in patients being subjected to harmful treatment regimens, which would not be the case, were routine practice altered, in line with evidence-based guidelines.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Increasingly, women newly diagnosed with breast cancer are being offered treatment-focused genetic testing (TFGT). As the demand for TFGT increases, streamlined methods of genetic education are needed.\nMETHODS: In this noninferiority trial, women aged <50 years with either a strong family history (FH+) or other features suggestive of a germ-line mutation (FH-) were randomized before definitive breast cancer surgery to receive TFGT education either as brief written materials (intervention group (IG)) or during a genetic counseling session at a familial cancer clinic (usual-care group (UCG)). Women completed self-report questionnaires at four time points over 12 months.\nRESULTS: A total of 135 women were included in the analysis, all of whom opted for TFGT. Decisional conflict about TFGT choice (primary outcome) was not inferior in the IG compared with the UCG (noninferiority margin of -10; mean difference = 2.45; 95% confidence interval -2.87-7.76; P = 0.36). Costs per woman counseled in the IG were significantly lower (AUD$89) compared with the UCG (AUD$173; t(115) = 6.02; P < 0.001).\nCONCLUSION: A streamlined model of educating women newly diagnosed with breast cancer about TFGT seems to be a cost-effective way of delivering education while ensuring that women feel informed and supported in their decision making, thus freeing resources for other women to access TFGT.Genet Med 19 4, 448-456.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A need for a governance of genomics in healthcare among European Union (EU) countries arose during an international meeting of experts on public health genomics (PHG). We have conducted a survey on existing national genomic policies in healthcare among Chief Medical Officers (CMOs) of the 28 EU member states, plus Norway.\nMETHODS: A questionnaire was sent to CMOs after a meeting on the policy implications of PHG held during the Italian presidency of the Council of EU in 2014. The survey was closed in November 2015.\nRESULTS: CMOs response rate was 65.5% (19/29). Twelve (63.2%) reported that their countries had a policy for genomics in healthcare in place, and 15 (78.9%) reported that public funding existed. Public research facilities for the development of such policies were documented in 13 (68.4%) countries, and 15 (83.3%) had working groups devoted to policy development. National agencies carrying out Health Technology Assessment of genomic-based technologies were present in nine countries (50%). Sixteen (88.9%) countries reported having agencies dealing with ethical issues related to genomic technologies. About 55% of countries disclosed the lack of information campaigns aimed at citizens, and 44.4% reported they had a legal framework for direct-to-consumer genetic tests.\nCONCLUSION: Belgium, France, Italy, Spain and UK documented the presence of a policy on genomics in healthcare. While many caveats are necessary because of the methodology, results suggest a need for a co-ordinated effort to foster development and harmonization of dedicated policies across EU to responsibly integrate genomics policies into existing health systems.",

        "abstract": "AIMS: No recommendations currently exist regarding implementation of both prenatal diagnosis and preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). This study evaluated attitudes in ADPKD patients with either chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages I-IV or end-stage renal failure (ESRF) toward prenatal diagnosis and PGD.\nMETHODS: Ninety-six ADPKD patients were recruited from an outpatient clinic, wards, and dialysis units. Thirty-eight patients had ESRF and 58 had CKD stages I-IV. Participants were given an information sheet on prenatal diagnosis and PGD and subsequently completed a questionnaire.\nRESULTS: The median age of participants was 51.5 years. Seventeen percent of ADPKD patients with CKD and 18% of ADPKD patients with ESRF would consider prenatal diagnosis and termination of pregnancy for ADPKD. Fifty percent with CKD would have opted for PGD (or might consider it in the future) were it available and funded by the UK National Health Service, compared to 63% in the ESRF group (p\u2009=\u20090.33). Sixty-nine percent in the CKD group and 68% in the ESRF group believed that PGD should be offered to other patients.\nDISCUSSION: There was a spectrum of attitudes among this cohort. A proportion of patients believe that PGD should be made available to prospective parents with this disease. The discrepancy between the low proportion (17% CKD, 18% ESRF) who would consider prenatal diagnosis and termination of pregnancy and the higher number who hypothetically express an intention or wish to access PGD (50% CKD and 63% ESRF) indicates far greater acceptability for diagnostic methods that occur before embryo implantation. It is not known how the development of methods to identify patients whose renal function is likely to decline rapidly and treatments altering the natural history of ADPKD will affect these attitudes.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Efforts to identify genetic moderators of pharmacotherapy response have generated interest in clinical applications of pharmacogenetic tests in alcohol use disorder (AUD) treatment. To date, no research on providers' interest in using pharmacogenetic tests in the context of AUD treatment has been reported. We conducted qualitative interviews with primary care providers from 5 clinics in the Veterans Health Administration (VA) to assess their interest in using a hypothetical genetic test to inform treatment of AUD with pharmacotherapy.\nMETHODS: Key contacts were used to recruit 24 providers from 5 primary care clinics associated with a single large VA medical facility. Participants completed 30-minute in-person semi-structured interviews focused on barriers and facilitators to provision of pharmacotherapy for AUD. Interviews included a hypothetical scenario regarding the availability of a genetic test to inform AUD pharmacotherapy provision and/or selection. Provider responses to the hypothetical scenario were recorded, transcribed and analyzed qualitatively using inductive content analysis. Data were independently coded by three investigators, and themes were identified via consensus.\nRESULTS: Participants were generally interested in a genetic test to aid in AUD treatment planning. Five common themes were identified, including: perceived benefits of a pharmacogenetic test (e.g., aiding with therapeutic choice, positively impacting patient motivation for and engagement with AUD treatment), perceived drawbacks (e.g., limiting potential benefits of pharmacotherapy by reducing the target population for its receipt, adverse impacts of \"negative\" results), caveats to clinical utility (e.g., utility would depend on prognostic accuracy and/or medication characteristics), uncertainty as to whether such a test would impact clinical decision-making, and pragmatic barriers to use (costs and other resources, such as laboratory facilities).\nCONCLUSIONS: Primary care providers in this study generally believed a genetic test to aid in AUD treatment planning would be useful, due to its potential to hone treatment choice as well as to influence patient motivation and adherence to treatment. However, providers acknowledged that a test's utility would depend on the strength of its prognostic characteristics, its other benefits relative to standard care, and lack of pragmatic barriers.",

        "abstract": "This paper considers the ethical, legal, and social issues raised by the prospect of increasing use of psychiatric genetic data in child custody litigation. Although genetic tests cannot currently confirm a parent or child's psychiatric diagnosis, it is likely that as relevant findings emerge, they will be introduced in family courts to challenge parental capacity. Here, we draw on three projected, but plausible, scenarios for obtaining psychiatric data about parents -- imposed genetic testing, access to medical records, and genetic theft -- then consider the use of psychiatric genetic data of children, to highlight the issues that judges, child custody evaluators, and clinicians who may provide treatment for parents or children with mental health issues will need to consider. These include: genetic privacy, stigma, genetic surveillance, and judicial and health professionals' bias. We argue that the unchecked introduction of psychiatric genetic data may have a detrimental effect on the administration of justice. In particular, the article highlights the risk that the (mis)use of psychiatric genetic data in custody disputes would 1) exacerbate stigma and treatment-avoidance among parents and incentivize privacy violations to pressure parents to relinquish parental rights; 2) disproportionately affect poor parents and single mothers of color involved with Child Protective Services; and 3) detract attention from social and environmental factors impacting mental health to the detriment of the families involved. Awareness of these issues and an understanding of the meaning of genomic data by judges and custody evaluators will be pivotal in ensuring that justice is served.",

Of 1091 incident patients 51% provided a family history. Seventy-two percent of families were at low or intermediate-low risk of CRC and colonoscopic screening recommendations were provided by letter. Twenty-eight percent were at high and intermediate-high risk and were referred to the genetic counsellor, but only 30% (N\u2009=\u200948) were interviewed by study end. Colonoscopy was recommended more frequently than every 5 years in 35% of families. Lower family risk was associated with older age of proband but the frequency of screening colonoscopy recommendations varied across all age groups, driven by variability in family history. Twenty-four percent had a high MMR predict score for a Lynch syndrome mutation, and 23% fulfilled the Provincial Program criteria for LS screening. A population-based approach in the provision of colonoscopic screening recommendations to families at risk of CRC was limited by the relatively low response rate.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The introduction of prenatal cfDNA screening for fetal aneuploidy and other genetic conditions has exacerbated concerns about informed decision-making in clinical prenatal testing. To assess the information provided to patients to facilitate decisions about cfDNA screening, we collected written patient education and consent documents created by laboratories and clinics.\nMETHODS: Informed consent documents (IC) were coded by two independent coders. Each IC was assessed for readability, attention to elements of informed consent, and completeness of information about the test and the screened conditions.\nRESULTS: We found variance between IC produced by commercial laboratories versus those provided by local clinics or health care systems, and considerable variance among materials from all sources. \"Commercial\" IC were longer and written at a more difficult reading level than \"non-commercial\" IC, and were less likely to state explicitly that cfDNA only screens for certain conditions. About one-third of IC were combined with laboratory order forms. Though most IC recommended confirmatory testing for positive results, only about half clearly stated that results could be incorrect-including mentions of false positives or false negatives. About one-third of IC explicitly stated that cfDNA screening was optional. While nearly all IC from any source listed the conditions screened by the test, only about half of the IC included any phenotypic descriptions of these conditions. Few IC mentioned psychosocial considerations, and only one IC mentioned the availability of support groups for families of children with genetic conditions.\nCONCLUSIONS: Based on our findings, we recommend that written and well-informed consent be sought before performing cfDNA screening, and we offer minimal and recommended standards for patient education and consent materials.",

        "abstract": "The defining difference between genetic and traditional medicine is that genetic findings have implications not just for the patient, but also for their relatives. Discussion of a test result between parent and child is both a transformative and a translational moment in the life of a family. Parents report wanting help in talking to their children. The challenge for genetic counselors and other providers is to be able to recognize which issues are at the core of parental distress and be able to offer recommendations to empower and support parents. The complexity of potential genetic findings, including variants of uncertain significance (VUS) and incidental findings have vastly increased, requiring considerable explanation and leaving less time for discussion of emotional issues. While the nature of the testing (single gene to multigene panel and genomic testing) is dramatically changing, the nature of parent concerns remains remarkably constant. Families differ in many respects, so no \"recipe\" suffices to answer parents' questions about how this important task should be approached in each family. Successful consultation to parents requires true counseling, matching parents' fears and questions with information, exploration and advice specific to their concerns, their circumstances and strengths.",

Prospectively collected data included clinicopathologic factors, physician estimates of local recurrence risk, DCIS Score results, and pre-/post-assay radiotherapy recommendations for each patient made by a surgeon and a radiation oncologist. Patients completed pre-/post-assay decisional conflict scale and state-trait anxiety inventory instruments.\nRESULTS: The analysis cohort included 127 patients: median age 60\u00a0years, 80\u00a0% postmenopausal, median size 8\u00a0mm (39\u00a0% \u22645\u00a0mm), 70\u00a0% grade 1/2, 88\u00a0% estrogen receptor-positive, 75\u00a0% progesterone receptor-positive, 54\u00a0% with comedo necrosis, and 18\u00a0% multifocal. Sixty-six percent of patients had low DCIS Score results, 20\u00a0% had intermediate DCIS Score results, and 14\u00a0% had high DCIS Score results; the median result was 21 (range 0-84). Pre-assay, surgeons and radiation oncologists recommended radiotherapy for 70.9 and 72.4\u00a0% of patients, respectively. Post-assay, 26.4\u00a0% of overall recommendations changed, including 30.7 and 22.0\u00a0% of recommendations by surgeons and radiation oncologists, respectively.

Previous chart review studies report more aggressiveness/anger and psychotic features in youths with BPD. They show that adverse family environment and parental psychopathology constitute important factors for BPD pathology.\nOBJECTIVES: To examine clinical characteristics of depressed BPD adolescents (12-17\u2009years old) outpatients according to gender and to explore variables which are associated with BPD traits.\nMETHODS: A retrospective chart review using the child and adolescent version of the retrospective diagnostic instrument for borderlines was conducted on 30 depressed adolescents with BPD traits and 28 depressed patients without BPD traits. Participants who reached the retrospective diagnostic instrument for borderlines threshold for BPD were included in the BPD traits group. Comparison analyses were performed using Pearson's Chi-square test. Associated factors were determined using regression analyses.\nRESULTS: BPD traits participants were characterized by higher family problems (parental psychopathology, parent disagreement/argument, and parent-child relational problem), more aggressive symptoms, and higher rates of family intervention and hospitalization. A number of familial factors (parental history of delinquency, substance use, personality disorders, having siblings, or parental disagreement/argument in boys) were associated with BPD traits. Attention seeking and problematic functioning (does not adapt well to group activities) were also associated with BPD traits.\nDISCUSSION: Our study stresses the need to assess BPD traits in adolescent psychiatric evaluation, especially in the presence of aggressive behaviors, family problems and attention seeking.

        "abstract": "In this paper we explore the rise of 'the breast cancer gene' as a field of medical, cultural and personal knowledge. We address its significance in the Norwegian public health care system in relation to so-called biological citizenship in this particular national context. One of our main findings is that, despite its claims as a measure for health and disease prevention, gaining access to medical knowledge of BRCA 1/2 breast cancer gene mutations can also produce severe instability in the individuals and families affected. That is, although gene testing provides modern subjects with an opportunity to foresee their biological destiny and thereby become patients in waiting, it undoubtedly also comes with difficult existential dilemmas and choices, with implications that resonate beyond the individual and into different family and love relations. By elaborating on this finding we address the question of whether the empowerment slogan, which continues to be advocated through various health, BRCA and breast cancer discourses, reinforces a na\u00efve or an idealized notion of the actively responsible patient: resourceful enough to seek out medical expertise and gain sufficient knowledge, on which to base informed decisions, thereby reducing the future risk of developing disease. In contrast to this ideal, our Norwegian informants tell a different story, in which there is no apparent heroic mastery of genetic fates, but rather a pragmatic attitude to dealing with a dire situation over which they have little control, despite having complied with medical advice through national guidelines and follow-up procedures for BRCA 1/2 carriers. In conclusion we claim that the sense of safety that gene testing and its associated medical solutions allegedly promise to provide proved illusory. Although BRCA-testing offers the potential for protection from adverse DNA-heritage, administered through possibilities for self-monitoring and self-management of the body, the feeling of 'being in good health' has hardly been reinforced by the emergence of gene technology.",

We examined health-care providers' views and experiences to inform the design of a reflex-testing program and their perspectives regarding an opt-out option.\nMETHODS: We interviewed providers managing LS or colorectal cancer patients, including surgeons, genetic counselors, oncologists, primary-care physicians, and gastroenterologists. Qualitative data were analyzed thematically using constant comparison techniques.\nRESULTS: Providers supported a reflex-testing program because of the current lack of coordinated immunohistochemistry (IHC) testing and underascertainment of LS patients as well as the opportunity to standardize the increasing use of genomic tests in practice. Most supported an opt-out after reflex testing because they felt that IHC is akin to other pathology tests, which are not optional. Some favored an opt-out before testing because of concern for patients experiencing distress, insurance discrimination, or a diagnostic odyssey that may be inconclusive.\nCONCLUSION: Providers support a reflex-testing program to improve the identification and management of suspected LS patients. However, how to support meaningful information provision to enable an opt-out without jeopardizing testing uptake and the anticipated public health benefits remains a policy challenge.Genet Med advance online publication 06 October 2016.",

Life for individuals with sickle cell disease can be affected by repeated acute complications and compounded by progressive organ damage. Studies reveal that when people with chronic illness learn self-management, their clinical outcomes and quality of life improves; and they show lower dependence on healthcare services.

Additional trials were sought from the reference lists of the trials and reviews identified by the search strategy.Date of last search: 11 April 2016.\nSELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials which evaluate the effectiveness of individual- and group-based interventions for either the patient with sickle cell disease or their caregivers, or both. Eligible interventions will aim to change knowledge, attitudes or skills, improve psychosocial aspects of the disease as well as treatment adherence and healthcare utilization. Trials evaluating the intervention versus no program, comparing two interventions and those which are part of a multi-faceted intervention to improve a range of sickle cell-related health outcomes are all eligible for inclusion.\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently selected trials based on stated inclusion criteria and thereafter examined each selected report to extract data using a prepared, piloted, data collection form. A third author assisted in reaching consensus if there were any discrepancies. Similarly, risk of bias was assessed by two authors and verified by a third author.\nMAIN RESULTS: A total of 12 trials (11 randomized controlled trials and one quasi-randomized trial) of 563 people with HbSS, HbSC or HbS\u03b2thal, aged six to 35 years old, were included in the review; the majority of participants were African-American. Interventions ranged from a total of one hour to weekly sessions for eight weeks and the post-intervention assessments ranged from the end of the intervention period to 12 months after completion. The heterogeneity of the included trials, which encompasses setting, inclusion and exclusion criteria, interventional method and time of assessment, ranged from 'not important' to 'moderate to substantial' for different review outcomes. The overall risk of bias was low for selective reporting, unclear for random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and blinding of outcome assessment. Incomplete outcome reporting and blinding of personnel showed mixed bias representations.Patient knowledge was assessed by four trials (160 participants) with moderate to substantial heterogeneity. There was evidence that educational programs improved patient knowledge, standardised mean difference 0.87 points (95% confidence interval 0.28 to 1.45, moderate quality evidence), which improved further when a trial with high bias was removed in a sensitivity analysis. Caregiver knowledge, reported in a single trial of 20 families, also showed an improvement, standardised mean difference 0.52 points (95% confidence interval 0.03 to 1.00, moderate quality evidence). The effect on patient knowledge was sustained at longer follow-up periods, whereas the effect on caregiver knowledge was not sustained.There were two primary outcomes related to the effectiveness of educational programs on the recognition of signs and symptoms of disease-related morbidity. No comparative data were reported for patients or caregivers (or both) recognising signs and symptoms leading to self-management. Data from two trials were analysed for the utilization of health services and showed no evidence of an effect, mean difference 0.33 (95% confidence interval -0.57 to 1.23, moderate quality evidence).With regard to the review's secondary outcomes, depression showed a statistically significant decline in intervention groups, standardised mean difference -0.66 points (95% confidence interval -1.18, to -0.14, moderate quality evidence). Adherence to treatment was not assessed in any of the identified trials. No effects of interventions were seen on coping, family relationships or health-related quality of life of patients.The quality of evidence was low for positive coping and moderate for child knowledge, healthcare utilization and depression. This suggests that further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimates.\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This review identifies important positive effects of educational interventions on improving patient knowledge of sickle cell disease and depression. Effects on patients' knowledge were maintained for longer than for caregivers. The effect on knowledge was significant but small and whether it offers any clinical benefit is uncertain. Significant factors limiting these effects could be trials being under powered as well as attrition rates. Effects were not statistically significant in assessments of secondary outcomes, possibly due to the paucity of the number of trials and patients and caregivers. Trials showed moderate to high heterogeneity which might impact the results. To better study effects on outcomes, further controlled trials are needed with rigorous attention given to improve recruitment and retention and to decrease bias. Predetermined protocols using similar measurements should be used across multiple sites.",

        "title": "Measuring High-Risk Patients' Preferences for Pharmacogenetic Testing to Reduce Severe Adverse Drug Reaction: A Discrete Choice Experiment.",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To investigate patient preferences and willingness to pay (WTP) for a genetic test that can reduce the risk of life-threatening adverse drug reactions (ADRs). We hypothesize that test features (risk of developing the adverse reaction with and without testing, test cost, and treatment cost) and the choice context (physician recommendation and the most common choice made by peer patients) will influence choices.\nMETHODS: A discrete choice experiment was conducted in which 189 patients at high risk for gout were asked to choose between treatment options that varied along key attributes. A latent class logit model was used to analyze the choice data and test the hypotheses.\nRESULTS: We identified two classes of patients: the risk-averse class and the cost-conscious class. The WTP to reduce the risk of life-threatening ADRs from 1 out of 600 to 1 out of 1 million was SGD1215 in the risk-averse class. In contrast, in the cost-conscious class, the WTP was insensitive to the extent of risk reduction. Overall, the predicted take-up rate for the test is 65% at a price of SGD400. If the test was recommended by a physician or was chosen by most of the patients, the take-up rate for the test would increase by 8.5 and 1.5 percentage points, respectively.\nCONCLUSIONS: There is a potentially large demand for genetic tests that could reduce the risk of life-threatening ADRs. Physician recommendations and providing information on the choices of others are powerful influences on demand, even more so than moderate price reductions.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: To compare overall outcomes of conventional postnatal screening of familial retinoblastoma and prenatal RB1 mutation identification followed by planned early-term delivery.\nDESIGN: Retrospective, observational study.\nPARTICIPANTS: Twenty children with familial retinoblastoma born between 1996 and 2014 and examined within 1 week of birth.\nMETHODS: Cohort 1 included spontaneously delivered neonates examined within 1 week of birth and confirmed postnatal to carry their family's RB1 mutant allele. Cohort 2 included infants identified by amniocentesis to carry their family's RB1 mutant allele, and therefore scheduled for early-term delivery (36-38 weeks' gestation). Treatment for retinoblastoma was performed at the Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Age at first tumor in each eye, eye stage, treatments given, ocular salvage, treatment success (defined as avoidance of enucleation, external-beam irradiation, or both), visual outcome, number of anesthetics, pregnancy or delivery complications, and estimated treatment burden.\nRESULTS: Vision-threatening tumors were present at birth in 4 of 8 infants in cohort 1 and in 3 of 12 infants in cohort 2. Eventually, all infants demonstrated tumors in both eyes. At the first treatment, 1 of 8 infants in cohort 1 had eyes in stage cT1a/cT1a or cT1a/cT0 (smallest and least vision-threatening tumors), compared with 8 of 12 infants in cohort 2 (P\u00a0= 0.02). Null RB1 germline alleles induced earlier tumors than low-penetrance alleles (P\u00a0=\u00a00.03). Treatment success was achieved in 3 of 8 children in cohort 1 compared with 11 of 12 children in cohort 2 (P\u00a0= 0.002). Acceptable vision (better than 0.2 decimal) was achieved for 8 of 16 eyes in cohort 1 compared with 21 of 24 eyes in cohort 2 (P\u00a0= 0.014). Useful vision (better than 0.1, legal blindness) was achieved for 8 of 9 children in cohort 1 compared with 12 of 12 children in cohort 2. There were no complications related to early-term delivery. Median follow-up was 5.6 years, cohort 1 and 5.8 years, cohort\u00a02.\nCONCLUSIONS: When a parent had retinoblastoma, prenatal molecular diagnosis with early-term delivery increased the likelihood of infants born with no detectable tumors, better vision outcomes, and less invasive therapy. Prenatal molecular diagnosis facilitates anticipatory planning for both the child and family.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: There have been no trials in healthcare settings of genetic susceptibility feedback in relation to alcohol consumption. The purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility and acceptability of conducting a full-scale randomised trial estimating the effect of personalised genetic susceptibility feedback on alcohol consumption in hospital outpatients with risky drinking.\nMETHODS: Outpatients \u226518 years of age who reported drinking more than 14 standard drinks in the past week or in a typical week were asked to provide a saliva sample for genetic testing. Genetic susceptibility feedback was posted to participants 6 months after recruitment. The co-primary outcomes were the proportion of participants who (i) provided a saliva sample that could be genotyped, and (ii) spoke with a genetic counsellor. Secondary outcomes included changes in patients' weekly alcohol consumption; scores on scales measuring readiness to change, importance of changing and confidence in ability to change drinking habits; knowledge about which cancers are alcohol-attributable; and acceptability of the saliva collection procedure and the genetic-feedback intervention. McNemar's test and paired t-tests were used to test for differences between baseline and follow-up in proportions and means, respectively.\nRESULTS: Of 100 participants who provided a saliva sample, 93 had adequate DNA for at least one genotyping assay. Three participants spoke to a genetic counsellor. Patients' readiness to change their drinking, their views on the importance of changing and their stated confidence in their ability to change increased between baseline and follow-up. There was no increase in patients' knowledge about alcohol-attributable cancers nor any reduction in how much alcohol they drank 4 months after receiving the feedback. Most participants (80%) were somewhat comfortable or very comfortable with the process used to collect saliva, 84% understood the genetic feedback, 54% found it useful, 10% had sought support to reduce their drinking after receiving the feedback, and 37% reported that the feedback would affect how much they drink in the future.\nCONCLUSION: Results of this study suggest it would be feasible to conduct a methodologically robust trial estimating the effect of genetic susceptibility feedback on alcohol consumption in hospital outpatients with risky drinking.",

        "abstract": "We report herein results of a study performed in the Balearic Islands which had the following goals: 1) Determine the proportion of pregnant or non-pregnant women planning pregnancy, who would choose to undergo a screening test for Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), if it is accompanied by the appropriate information; 2) Assess satisfaction and any increase in stress among women who participate in screening; 3) Collect epidemiological information about the incidence of the disease in our population; and 4) Collect demographic and health history data and assess participants' awareness of the disease. Screening was performed on 3,731 pregnant and non-pregnant women of childbearing age and the results indicate: a very high voluntary rate of participation; a high level of self-reported satisfaction and low levels of stress because of the test; a very high incidence of premutation (1/106) in our population; and a low level of awareness about the existence of FXS (25\u00a0%). Additional findings indicate no significant correlation between self-reported health history and premutation detection, and the high premutation incidence does not seem to be specific to the indigenous Balearic population. Based on these results, we discuss the pros and cons of an implementation of preconception and pregnant women screening for FXS within a public health screening program.",

        "abstract": "Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) is a rare inborn error of metabolism resulting from a deficiency in the branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex. MSUD has been reported to be the most common inborn error of metabolism in the Philippines. We described all patients with maple syrup urine disease patients diagnosed through newborn screening during its first 2\u00a0years of implementation and the challenges encountered during their medical management. There were 24 patients diagnosed with maple syrup urine disease for the 2-year period. All patients needed hospital admission. The most common complication during hospital admission was infection, needing intravenous antibiotics which were given to 21 of the patients. Out of the 24 diagnosed, 16 patients are alive, while eight have died. Several neurologic and non-neurologic complications have been observed during the follow-up of the patients. The common challenges of MSUD management in a low-resource setting identified in this study were late diagnosis, lack of access to metabolic specialists and medical supplies, nosocomial septicemia, and protein deficiency. Aside from early properly timed collection, improvement in other logistical concerns will also help in earlier diagnosis. Mechanisms of transfer of critically ill patients must be improved. Hospitals in difficult-to-reach areas must be equipped to handle critical metabolic cases when transfers are not possible. Newborn screening has been proven to improve outcome in patients with MSUD but the success of the program in preventing disability is also dependent on improvements in other aspects of healthcare.",

A confidential on-line survey of GCs ever licensed in the state of Indiana was conducted. Of the 46 respondents, most provide direct patient care (69.6\u00a0%), have worked in their current position for 5\u00a0years or less (72.1\u00a0%), and are experienced genetic counselors, having graduated between 6 and 15\u00a0years ago (43.5\u00a0%). One-third (32.6\u00a0%) reported thinking about leaving their current position at least monthly. GCs were more likely to think about leaving their current position when they provided direct patient care (p\u00a0=\u00a00.04) and worked in a hospital/clinic setting (p\u00a0=\u00a00.01).

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Factor XI (FXI) deficiency is an autosomal bleeding disease associated with genetic defects in the F11 gene which cause decreased FXI levels or impaired FXI function. An increasing number of mutations has been reported in the FXI mutation database, most of which affect the serine protease domain of the protein. FXI is a heterogeneous disorder associated with a variable bleeding tendency and a variety of causative F11 gene mutations. The molecular basis of FXI deficiency in 14 patients from ten unrelated families in Turkey was analysed to establish genotype-phenotype correlations and inheritance of the mutations in the patients' families.\nMATERIAL AND METHODS: Fourteen index cases with a diagnosis of FXI deficiency and family members of these patients were enrolled into the study. The patients' F11 genes were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and subjected to direct DNA sequencing analysis. The findings were analysed statistically using bivariate correlations, Pearson's correlation coefficient and the nonparametric Mann-Whitney test.\nRESULTS: Direct DNA sequencing analysis of the F11 genes revealed that all of the 14 patients had a F11 gene mutation. Eight different mutations were identified in the apple 1, apple 2 or serine protease domains, except one which was a splice site mutation. Six of the mutations were recurrent. Two of the mutations were novel missense mutations, p.Val522Gly and p.Cys581Arg, within the catalytic domain. The p.Trp519Stop mutation was observed in two families whereas all the other mutations were specific to a single family.\nDISCUSSION: Identification of mutations confirmed the genetic heterogeneity of FXI deficiency. Most of the patients with mutations did not have any bleeding complications, whereas some had severe bleeding symptoms. Genetic screening for F11 gene mutations is important to decrease the mortality and morbidity rate associated with FXI deficiency, which can be life-threatening if bleeding occurs in tissues with high fibrinolytic activity.",

In the first round of a scoring form to prioritize the recommendations extracted from evidence-based guidelines was circulated between experts. The results of this survey were discussed in a consensus meeting, followed by a final appraisal of the selected recommendations. This resulted in a list of measurable KI's.\nRESULTS: Initially, 41 key recommendations on screening, diagnosis and treatment/management were extracted from three existing guidelines on HH (European Association for the Study of the Liver, American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and Dutch guideline on HH). Finally, a core set of 24 recommendations resulted in 15 KI's.\nCONCLUSIONS: This manuscript presents the results of the process to develop KI's to measure and improve the quality of care for patients with HH.",

Ten additional heterozygous pathogenic mutations were observed. From the chart review cohort, a C-terminus ferritin light chain (FTL) frameshift mutation was observed consistent with neuroferritinopathy. Heterozygous deletion of HFE2 and four additional rare pathogenic or likely pathogenic heterozygous mutations were identified in seven patients.\nCONCLUSIONS: An iron metabolism gene panel provided a molecular diagnosis in six patients with non-HFE iron overload and is suitable for diagnostic purposes in exceptional cases in specialized clinics.

        "abstract": "Family history of cancer is a well-known risk factor but the role of family history in survival is less clear. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between family history and cancer survival for the common cancers in Sweden. Using the Swedish population-based registers, patients diagnosed with the most common cancers were followed for cancer-specific death during 1991-2010. We used multivariate proportional hazards (Cox) regression models to contrast the survival of patients with a family history of cancer (individuals whose parent or sibling had a concordant cancer) to the survival of patients without a family history. Family history of cancer had a modest protective effect on survival for breast cancer (hazard ratio (HR)\u2009=\u20090.88, 95% confidence interval (95% CI)\u2009=\u20090.81 to 0.96) and prostate cancer (HR\u2009=\u20090.82, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.75 to 0.90). In contrast, family history of cancer was associated with worse survival for nervous system cancers (HR\u2009=\u20091.24, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.05 to 1.47) and ovarian cancer (HR\u2009=\u20091.20, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.01 to 1.43). Furthermore, the poorer survival for ovarian cancer was consistent with a higher FIGO stage and a greater proportion of more aggressive tumors of the serous type. The better survival for patients with a family history of breast and prostate cancer may be due to medical surveillance of family members. The poor survival for ovarian cancer patients with an affected mother or sister is multifactorial, suggesting that these cancers are more aggressive than their sporadic counterparts.",

We analysed the incidence of exposure of individual patients in the United States to multiple drugs for which pharmacogenomic guidelines are available (PGx drugs) within a selected four-year period (2009-2012) in order to identify and quantify the incidence of pharmacotherapy in a nation-wide patient population that could be impacted by pre-emptive PGx testing based on currently available clinical guidelines. In total, 73 024 095 patient records from private insurance, Medicare Supplemental and Medicaid were included. Patients enrolled in Medicare Supplemental age > = 65 or Medicaid age 40-64 had the highest incidence of PGx drug use, with approximately half of the patients receiving at least one PGx drug during the 4 year period and one fourth to one third of patients receiving two or more PGx drugs. These data suggest that exposure to multiple PGx drugs is common and that it may be beneficial to implement wide-scale pre-emptive genomic testing. Future work should therefore concentrate on investigating the cost-effectiveness of multiplexed pre-emptive testing strategies.",

Four GRSs were constructed using between 8 and 51 previously identified genetic variants. After a mean (\u00b1SD) follow-up of 5.9 (\u00b11.5) years, 1864 incident CHD events were documented. All GRSs were linearly associated with CHD in a model adjusted by individual risk factors: hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) per SD unit: 1.21 (1.15-1.26) for GRS_8, 1.20 (1.15-1.26) for GRS_12, 1.23 (1.17-1.28) for GRS_36, and 1.23 (1.17-1.28) for GRS_51. Inclusion of the GRSs improved the C statistic (\u0394C statistic =0.008 for GRS_8 and GRS_36; 0.007 for GRS_12; and 0.009 for GRS_51; all P<0.001). The net reclassification improvement was 5% for GRS_8, GRS_12, and GRS_36 and 4% for GRS_51 in the entire cohort and was (after correcting for bias) 9% for GRS_8 and GRS_12 and 7% for GRS_36 and GRS_51 when analyzing those classified as intermediate Framingham risk (10%-20%). The number required to treat to prevent 1 CHD after selectively treating with statins up-reclassified subjects on the basis of genetic information was 36 for GRS_8 and GRS_12, 41 for GRS_36, and 43 for GRS_51.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate significant and clinically relevant incremental discriminative/predictive capability of 4 multilocus GRSs for incident CHD among subjects of European ancestry.",

Costs and health benefit in life years gained (LYG) included surveillance for LS carriers among EC patients and relatives. We calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) comparing LS screening among EC patients \u226470years with \u226450years and the revised Bethesda guidelines.\nRESULTS: Screening for LS in 179 EC patients identified 7 LS carriers; 1 was \u226450 and 6 were 51-70years. Per age category 18 and 9 relatives were identified as LS carrier. Screening resulted in 74,7 LYG (45,4 and 29,3 LYG per age category). The ICER for LS screening in EC patients \u226470 compared with \u226450years was \u20ac5,252/LYG. The revised Bethesda guidelines missed 4/7 (57%) LS carriers among EC patients. The ICER for LS screening in EC patients \u226470years of age compared with the revised Bethesda guidelines was \u20ac6,668/LYG. Both ICERs remained <\u20ac16,000/LYG in sensitivity analyses.\nCONCLUSION: Routine LS screening in EC patients \u226470years is a cost-effective strategy, allowing colorectal cancer prevention in EC patients and their relatives.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This paper describes the Precision Medicine Knowledge Base (PMKB; https://pmkb.weill.cornell.edu ), an interactive online application for collaborative editing, maintenance, and sharing of structured clinical-grade cancer mutation interpretations.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: PMKB was built using the Ruby on Rails Web application framework. Leveraging existing standards such as the Human Genome Variation Society variant description format, we implemented a data model that links variants to tumor-specific and tissue-specific interpretations. Key features of PMKB include support for all major variant types, standardized authentication, distinct user roles including high-level approvers, and detailed activity history. A REpresentational State Transfer (REST) application-programming interface (API) was implemented to query the PMKB programmatically.\nRESULTS: At the time of writing, PMKB contains 457 variant descriptions with 281 clinical-grade interpretations. The EGFR, BRAF, KRAS, and KIT genes are associated with the largest numbers of interpretable variants. PMKB's interpretations have been used in over 1500 AmpliSeq tests and 750 whole-exome sequencing tests. The interpretations are accessed either directly via the Web interface or programmatically via the existing API.\nDISCUSSION: An accurate and up-to-date knowledge base of genomic alterations of clinical significance is critical to the success of precision medicine programs. The open-access, programmatically accessible PMKB represents an important attempt at creating such a resource in the field of oncology.\nCONCLUSION: The PMKB was designed to help collect and maintain clinical-grade mutation interpretations and facilitate reporting for clinical cancer genomic testing. The PMKB was also designed to enable the creation of clinical cancer genomics automated reporting pipelines via an API.",

        "abstract": "Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has enabled new approaches for detection of mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes responsible for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC). The search for germline mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes is of importance with respect to oncogenetic and surgical (bilateral mastectomy, ovariectomy) counselling. Testing tumor material for BRCA mutations is of increasing importance for therapeutic decision making as the poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, olaparib, is now available to treat patients with specific forms of ovarian cancer and BRCA mutations. Molecular genetics laboratories should develop reliable and sensitive techniques for the complete analysis of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. This is a challenge due to the size of the coding sequence of the BRCA1/2 genes, the absence of hot spot mutations, and particularly by the lower DNA quality obtained from Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded (FFPE) tissue. As a result, a number of analyses are uninterpretable and do not always provide a result to the clinician, limiting the optimal therapeutic management of patients. The availability of Fresh Frozen Tissue (FFT) for some laboratories and the excellent quality of the DNA extracted from it offers an alternative. For this reason, we evaluated Multiplicom's BRCA MASTR Dx assay on a set of 97 FFT derived DNA samples, in combination with the MID for Illumina MiSeq for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation detection.

Nevertheless, we observed a benefit in pregnancy rates of these couples.\nRESULT(S): We detected chromosomal abnormalities in 133/207 embryos (64.2% of successfully amplified), and 74 showed a normal microarray profile (35.7%). In 48 of the 133 abnormal embryos (36.1%), an unbalanced rearrangement originating from the parental translocation was identified. Interestingly, 34.6% of the abnormal embryos (46/133) harbored chromosome rearrangements that were not directly linked to the parental translocation in question. We also detected a combination of unbalanced parental-derived rearrangements and aneuploidies in 27 of the 133 abnormal embryos (20.3%).\nCONCLUSION(S): The use of trophectoderm biopsy at the blastocyst stage is less detrimental to the survival of the embryo and leads to a more reliable estimate of the genomic content of the embryo than cleavage-stage biopsy. In this small cohort PGD study, we describe the successful implementation of array CGH analysis of blastocysts in patients with a chromosomal rearrangement to identify euploid embryos for transfer.",

Yet, little is known about the way these tests are offered and how patients are affected by a positive test result.

A content analysis was conducted on the transcript data from the interviews. Outcomes of this research suggest that educational interventions are needed to improve maternal understanding of positive carrier screening results. Most of the participants in this study confused the results with other prenatal screening test options. In addition, the way the results were discussed varied greatly, and influenced participants' thoughts about reproductive decisions that led to a range of emotional uncertainty. Our data suggests that genetic counseling improved participants' understanding of positive results. More research is needed to further understand if our results are consistent within a larger, more diverse sample, and to explore how to best provide education about expanded carrier screening.",

This review explores recent evidence concerning cost-effectiveness in familial hypercholesterolemia, and discusses the cause of, and likelihood of solutions to, the paucity of such evidence.\nRECENT FINDINGS: Cost-effectiveness analysis in familial hypercholesterolemia has been limited almost exclusively to adult populations. However, there is growing evidence that childhood intervention offers substantial benefit in terms of downstream health gains. Statin therapy in adults has been demonstrated to be cost-effective, but the range of novel agents that might be used will require de novo economic evaluation alongside exploration of their effect and safety profile.\nSUMMARY: The familial hypercholesterolemia field has limited evidence regarding cost-effectiveness, which limits optimum allocation of resources. Economic evaluations are necessary to appraise new agents and optimal timing of management approaches. Evaluations often have substantial data demands; consequentially, their applicability to medical decision-making or policy will be partly determined by the availability of data, particularly those providing information about the long-term trajectory of health benefit from familial hypercholesterolemia treatment.",

In many jurisdictions, decisions regarding pricing and reimbursement of these health technologies comprise evidence of value for money.\nOBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to develop a cost-effectiveness model based on the Duchenne muscular dystrophy Functional Ability Self-Assessment Tool (DMDSAT), a new rating scale created specifically to measure disease progression in clinical practice and trials and model DMD in economic evaluations, and compare it with two alternative model structures.\nMETHODS: We constructed three Markov cohort state-transition models to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a hypothetical intervention for DMD versus standard of care in a UK setting. Model\u00a0I was based on the DMDSAT, model\u00a0II on stages of disease as defined in the DMD clinical care guidelines and model\u00a0III on patients' ventilation status. The conceptual model structures were formulated in collaboration with three DMD experts.\nRESULTS: All three models were judged to have good validity with regards to the appropriateness of the choice of modelling technique, conceptual representation of the disease, model input data and model outcomes. Across frameworks, lifetime direct medical costs with standard of care ranged between \u00a3217,510 and \u00a3284,640, total costs between \u00a3624,240 and \u00a3713,840, and total number of quality-adjusted life-years between 5.96 and 7.17.\nCONCLUSIONS: We present a first version of a model for the economic evaluation of treatments for DMD based on the DMDSAT, as well as two alternative frameworks encompassing conventional staging of disease progression.

However, statin therapy is often interrupted in patients experiencing musculoskeletal pain or myopathy, which are common in this patient group. Currently, the standard tests for diagnosing statin myopathies are difficult to interpret. A pharmacogenomics (PGx) test to diagnose statin-induced myopathy would be highly desirable.\nMETHODS: We developed a Markov state model to assess the cost-effectiveness of a hypothetical PGx test, which aims to identify statin-induced myopathy in high-risk, secondary prevention cardiovascular patients. The alternative strategy hypothesized is that physicians or patients interrupt the statin therapy in the presence of musculoskeletal pain. Our model includes health states specific to the PGx test outcome which assesses the impact of test errors.\nRESULTS: Assuming a perfect test, the results indicate that the PGx test strategy dominates when the test costs less than CAN$356, when the strategy is cost neutral. These results are robust to deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.\nCONCLUSION: Our base-case results show that a PGx test for statin-induced myopathy in a high-risk, secondary prevention of a cardiovascular event population would be a dominant solution for a test cost of CAN$356 or less. Furthermore, the modelling of the complete range of diagnostic test outcomes provide a broader understanding of the economic value of the pharmacogenomics test.",

We developed a tool to guide parents carrying a BRCA1/2 mutation share their genetic result with underage children. Here, we report on the development of this tool using a qualitative methodology. A tool prototype was developed based on the International Patient Decision Aids Standards Collaboration framework. Content was assessed using feedback from focus groups, individual interviews, and a 12-item reading grid. Participants were nine BRCA1/2 mutation carriers with underage children and three cancer genetics health professionals. Thematic content analysis was conducted on interview transcripts. The tool was developed using an iterative process until saturation of data. An independent advisory committee was involved in all steps of tool development until reaching consensus. Rather than a decision aid per se (to communicate or not), the parents wanted a more comprehensive tool to help them communicate genetic test result to their children. To meet parents' needs, a communication guidance booklet was developed, setting out the pros and cons of communication, steps to prepare sharing the test result, communication tips, and parents' testimonies. This communication tool responds to a significant unmet need faced by parents carrying a genetic predisposition to cancer. Future studies are needed to assess how the information from the parent's genetic test result impacts the child's development, health behaviors, and relationship with the parent.",

Fifty centers reported cases retrospectively. Data were registered from neonatal screening or from the first contact at diagnosis until last follow-up or death.\nRESULTS: Data of the 715 eligible patients were collected: 615 SCD (497 SS, 64 SC, 54 SBeta phenotypes), 73 thalassemia, 9 CC phenotype, and 18 other variants. Most of the SCD patients were born in Spain (65%), and 51% of these were diagnosed at newborn screening. Median age at the first diagnosis was 0.4 years for thalassemia and 1.0 years for SCD. The estimated incidence was 0.002 thalassemia cases and 0.03 SCD cases/1,000 live births. Median age was 8.9 years (0.2-33.7) for thalassemia and 8.1 years (0.2-32.8) for SCD patients. Stroke was registered in 16 SCD cases. Transplantation was performed in 43 TM and 23 SCD patients at a median age of 5.2 and 7.8 years, respectively. Twenty-one patients died (3 TM, 17 SCD, 1 CC) and 200 were lost to follow-up. Causes of death were related to transplantation in three patients with TM and three patients with SCD.

        "abstract": "The key question of precision medicine is whether it is possible to find clinically actionable granularity in diagnosing disease and classifying patient risk. The advent of next-generation sequencing and the widespread adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) have provided clinicians and researchers a wealth of data and made possible the precise characterization of individual patient genotypes and phenotypes. Unstructured text-found in biomedical publications and clinical notes-is an important component of genotype and phenotype knowledge. Publications in the biomedical literature provide essential information for interpreting genetic data. Likewise, clinical notes contain the richest source of phenotype information in EHRs. Text mining can render these texts computationally accessible and support information extraction and hypothesis generation. This chapter reviews the mechanics of text mining in precision medicine and discusses several specific use cases, including database curation for personalized cancer medicine, patient outcome prediction from EHR-derived cohorts, and pharmacogenomic research. Taken as a whole, these use cases demonstrate how text mining enables effective utilization of existing knowledge sources and thus promotes increased value for patients and healthcare systems. Text mining is an indispensable tool for translating genotype-phenotype data into effective clinical care that will undoubtedly play an important role in the eventual realization of precision medicine.",

Balanced reciprocal translocations associated with reproductive failures are predominantly observed on chromosome 1. Additionally, infertile male patients present a number of breakpoints throughout chromosome 1. A translocation breakpoint might interrupt the structure of an important gene, leading to male infertility. Here, we report the breakpoints on chromosome 1 translocation and the clinical features presented in carriers, to enable informed genetic counseling of these patients. Balanced reciprocal translocations were found in 1.57% of the tested patients. Among 82 patients, 23 patients (28.05%) were carriers of the chromosome 1 translocation: 12 presented pre-gestational infertility with clinical manifestations of azoospermia or oligozoospermia, while 11 patients presented gestational infertility (able to conceive but with a tendency to miscarry or give birth to a stillborn).

        "abstract": "Precision medicine promises to develop diagnoses and treatments that take individual variability into account. According to most specialists, turning this promise into reality will require adapting the established framework of clinical research ethics, and paying more attention to participants' attitudes towards sharing genotypic, phenotypic, lifestyle data and health records, and ultimately to their desire to be engaged as active partners in medical research.Notions such as participation, engagement and partnership have been introduced in bioethics debates concerning genetics and large-scale biobanking to broaden the focus of discussion beyond individual choice and individuals' moral interests. The uptake of those concepts in precision medicine is to be welcomed. However, as data and medical information from research participants in precision medicine cohorts will be collected on an individual basis, translating a participatory approach in this emerging area may prove cumbersome. Therefore, drawing on Joseph Raz's perfectionism, we propose a principle of respect for autonomous agents that, we reckon, can address many of the concerns driving recent scholarship on partnership and public participation, while avoiding some of the limitations these concept have in the context of precision medicine. Our approach offers a normative clarification to how becoming partners in precision is compatible with retaining autonomy.Realigning the value of autonomy with ideals of direct engagement, we show, can provide adequate normative orientation to precision medicine; it can do justice to the idea of moral pluralism by stressing the value of moral self-determination: and, finally, it can reconcile the notion of autonomy with other more communitarian values such as participation and solidarity.",

This is expected given the ethical questions involved. However, using these new resources robustly to examine population choices when it comes to health insurer selection, coverage therein and especially the subsequent use of health services is a necessary step forward, especially given the increasing prevalence of multimorbidity. Such a novel advancement in health services research may eventually propel public and private insurers to redesign their infrastructure to more accurately reflect the behavioural inclinations of their beneficiary populations. Using this resource will likely provide equally important insight for countries with extensive mixed insurer systems (like the United States) or nations with a greater emphasis on single-payer systems (such as various European models).",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Genomic research has innumerable benefits. However, if people are unwilling to participate in genomic research, application of knowledge will be limited. This study examined the likelihood of respondents from a high- and a low- to middle-income country to participate in genetic research.\nMETHODS: Cross-sectional data were collected using Amazon's Mechanical Turk workforce to ascertain attitudes toward participation in genetic research. Registered country of residence was either the US (n = 505) or India (n = 505). Multiple logistic regression models were used to assess adjusted effects of demographic characteristics, health, social status, beliefs and concerns on 4 genetic research outcomes.\nRESULTS: Participants from India who believed chance and powerful others influenced their health were more likely to participate in genetic research (OR = 1.0, 95% CI 1.0-1.1) and to agree with sharing of DNA data (OR = 1.1, 95% CI 1.1-1.2). US participants were more likely to be concerned about protection of family history, which they indicated would affect participation (OR = 3.6, 95% CI 2.1-6.0). Commonalities for the likelihood of participation were beliefs that genetic research could help find new treatments (India OR = 2.3, 95% CI 1.0-5.4; US OR = 4.7, 95% CI 2.0-11.2) and descendants would benefit (India OR = 2.6, 95% CI 1.2-5.5; US OR = 3.0, 95% CI 1.3-7.1).\nCONCLUSIONS: Concurrence of beliefs on benefits and concerns about genetic research suggest they may be common across countries. Consideration of commonalities may be important to increase global participation in genetic research.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: With the increasing interest in apolipoprotein E (APOE) genetic testing to estimate the risk of developing late-onset Alzheimer disease, new educational tools are needed to help people make the best decision for themselves about whether to undergo this test. This study evaluated an online tool to assist in this decision process.\nMETHODS: A prototype decision aid was studied in a two-part survey that collected data from participants before and after they examined the decision aid. Both surveys had multiple-choice options and opportunities for open-ended responses, yielding quantitative and qualitative information. The responses before and after use of the aid were compared for each participant.\nRESULTS: A total of 1,262 individuals completed both surveys. The overall effectiveness of the decision aid was shown by three measures: 94% found the decision aid very helpful or somewhat helpful; general knowledge was increased; and some people changed their minds about APOE genetic testing, with 35% shifting to a higher likelihood of undergoing the test and 20% to a lower likelihood. Suggestions for improvements were noted and incorporated into the online tool.\nCONCLUSION: This decision aid can provide useful educational assistance to many individuals as they consider APOE genetic testing as well as facilitate further discussions with their health-care providers.Genet Med advance online publication 03 November 2016.",

Numerous laboratory processes are required to support the identification, interpretation, and reporting of clinically significant variants. This study aimed to examine the workflow and reporting procedures among US laboratories to highlight shared practices and identify areas in need of standardization.\nMETHODS: Surveys and follow-up interviews were conducted with laboratories offering exome and/or genome sequencing to support a research program or for routine clinical services. The 73-item survey elicited multiple choice and free-text responses that were later clarified with phone interviews.\nRESULTS: Twenty-one laboratories participated. Practices highly concordant across all groups included consent documentation, multiperson case review, and enabling patient opt-out of incidental or secondary findings analysis. Noted divergence included use of phenotypic data to inform case analysis and interpretation and reporting of case-specific quality metrics and methods. Few laboratory policies detailed procedures for data reanalysis, data sharing, or patient access to data.\nCONCLUSION: This study provides an overview of practices and policies of experienced exome and genome sequencing laboratories.

Some reciprocal translocation carriers exhibit azoospermia or oligozoospermia, and an association exists between these chromosomal abnormalities and recurrent abortion. Previous reports have indicated the involvement of chromosome 7 translocations in male infertility and recurrent miscarriage. A translocation breakpoint can occur within an important gene, interrupting its structure and leading to male infertility. However, clinical characteristics resulting from chromosome 7 translocation breakpoints have not been studied. Here, we report such breakpoints and their associated clinical features, to enable informed genetic counseling of carriers. Balanced reciprocal translocations were found in 1.57% of the tested patients. Among these 82 individuals, 14 (17.07%) carried a chromosome 7 translocation, of which, five presented with pregestational infertility and clinical manifestations of oligozoospermia or necrospermia, while nine presented with gestational infertility (i.e., were able to conceive, but often resulting in miscarriage). Breakpoints at 7q31 and 7q36 were associated with pregestational infertility, whereas those at 7p10, 7q21.2, 7q22, and 7q32 were connected to gestational infertility. However, the breakpoint at 7p15 was associated with both. Chromosome 7 translocation carriers with pregestational or gestational infertility should be counseled on chromosomal breakpoints and the various molecular technologies available for assisted reproduction.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: To truly achieve personalized medicine in oncology, it is critical to catalog and curate cancer sequence variants for their clinical relevance. The Somatic Working Group (WG) of the Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen), in cooperation with ClinVar and multiple cancer variant curation stakeholders, has developed a consensus set of minimal variant level data (MVLD). MVLD is a framework of standardized data elements to curate cancer variants for clinical utility. With implementation of MVLD standards, and in a working partnership with ClinVar, we aim to streamline the somatic variant curation efforts in the community and reduce redundancy and time burden for the interpretation of cancer variants in clinical practice.\nMETHODS: We developed MVLD through a consensus approach by i) reviewing clinical actionability interpretations from institutions participating in the WG, ii) conducting extensive literature search of clinical somatic interpretation schemas, and iii) survey of cancer variant web portals. A forthcoming guideline on cancer variant interpretation, from the Association of Molecular Pathology (AMP), can be incorporated into MVLD.\nRESULTS: Along with harmonizing standardized terminology for allele interpretive and descriptive fields that are collected by many databases, the MVLD includes unique fields for cancer variants such as Biomarker Class, Therapeutic Context and Effect. In addition, MVLD includes recommendations for controlled semantics and ontologies. The Somatic WG is collaborating with ClinVar to evaluate MVLD use for somatic variant submissions. ClinVar is an open and centralized repository where sequencing laboratories can report summary-level variant data with clinical significance, and ClinVar accepts cancer variant data.\nCONCLUSIONS: We expect the use of the MVLD to streamline clinical interpretation of cancer variants, enhance interoperability among multiple redundant curation efforts, and increase submission of somatic variants to ClinVar, all of which will enhance translation to clinical oncology practice.",

        "abstract": "Mammography is the recommended method for breast cancer screening of women in the general population. However, mammography alone does not perform as well as mammography plus supplemental screening in high-risk women. Therefore, supplemental screening with MRI or ultrasound is recommended in selected high-risk populations. Screening breast MRI is recommended in women at high risk for breast cancer on the basis of family history or genetic predisposition. Ultrasound is an option for those high-risk women who cannot undergo MRI. Recent literature also supports the use of breast MRI in some women of intermediate risk, and ultrasound may be an option for intermediate-risk women with dense breasts. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of other imaging modalities, such as thermography, breast-specific gamma imaging, positron emission mammography, and optical imaging, for breast cancer screening. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed every 2 years by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and review includes an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of a well-established consensus methodology (modified Delphi) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures by the panel.

        "abstract": "Next-generation sequencing (NGS) of immune receptors has become a standard tool to assess minimal residual disease (MRD) in patients treated for lymphoid malignancy, and it is being used to study the T-cell repertoire in many clinical settings. To better understanding the potential clinical utility and limitations of this application outside of MRD, we developed a BIOMED-2 primer-based NGS method and characterized its performance in controls and patients with graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after allogeneic hematopoietic transplant. For controls and patients with GVHD, replicate sequencing of the same T-cell receptor \u03b2 (TRB) libraries was highly reproducible. Higher variability was observed in sequencing of different TRB libraries made from the same DNA stock. Variability was increased in patients with GVHD compared with controls; patients with GVHD also had lower diversity than controls. In the T-cell repertoire of a healthy person, approximately 99.6% of the CDR3 clones were in low abundance, with frequency &lt;10-3. A single library could identify &gt;93% of the clones with frequency \u226510-3 in the repertoire. Sequencing in duplicate increased the average detection rate to &gt;97%. This work demonstrates that NGS reliably and robustly characterizes TRB populations in healthy individuals and patients with GVHD with frequency \u226510-3 and provides a methodologic framework for applying NGS immune repertoire methods to clinical testing applications beyond MRD.",

We previously developed a 100-locus DNA classifier capable of substratifying patients at risk of biochemical relapse within clinical risk groups.\nOBJECTIVE: The 100-locus genomic classifier was refined to 31 functional loci and tested with standard clinical variables for the ability to predict biochemical recurrence (BCR) and metastasis.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Four retrospective cohorts of radical prostatectomy specimens from patients with localized disease were pooled, and an additional 102-patient cohort used to measure the 31-locus genomic classifier with the NanoString platform.\nOUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The genomic classifier scores were tested for their ability to predict BCR (n=563) and metastasis (n=154), and compared with clinical risk stratification schemes.\nRESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: The 31-locus genomic classifier performs similarly to the 100-locus classifier. It identifies patients with elevated BCR rates (hazard ratio=2.73, p<0.001) and patients that eventually develop metastasis (hazard ratio=7.79, p<0.001). Combining the genomic classifier with standard clinical variables outperforms clinical models. Finally, the 31-locus genomic classifier was implemented using a NanoString assay. The study is limited to retrospective cohorts.\nCONCLUSIONS: The 100-locus and 31-locus genomic classifiers reliably identify a cohort of men with localized disease who have an elevated risk of failure. The NanoString assay will be useful for selecting patients for treatment deescalation or escalation in prospective clinical trials based on clinico-genomic scores from pretreatment biopsies.\nPATIENT SUMMARY: It is challenging to determine whether tumors confined to the prostate are aggressive, leading to significant undertreatment and overtreatment. We validated a test based on prostate tumor DNA that improves estimations of relapse risk, and that can help guide treatment planning.",

However, the now recognised risk of ovarian cancer (OC) patients, even those with no known family history, harbouring a mutation in BRCA1/2, together with the first poly adenosine diphosphate\u00a0ribose polymerase inhibitor (PARPi; olaparib [Lynparza]) being licenced for the treatment of BRCA-mutated OC, has led to reconsideration of referral criteria for OC patients. Provided here is a review of the existing data and guidelines in the European Union, relating to recommendations, as well as considerations, for the referral of OC patients for BRCA genetic testing. Based on this review of newly updated guidance and up-to-date evidence, the following is recommended: all patients with invasive epithelial OC (excluding borderline or mucinous), including those with fallopian tube and peritoneal cancers, should be considered as candidates for referral for BRCA genetic testing, irrespective of age; genetic testing should ideally be offered at diagnosis, although patients can be referred at any stage; retrospective testing should be offered to patients in long-term follow-up because of the implications for family members and individual future breast cancer risk; and germline BRCA testing of a blood/saliva sample should initially be conducted and, if negative, tumour tissue should be tested (to identify non-germline [somatic] BRCA PARPi therapy candidates).",

The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence and prognostic significance of possible FH in patients with myocardial infarction (MI).\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: By individual-level linkage of data from the Eastern Danish Heart Registry and national administrative registries, a study population of patients referred for coronary angiography due to MI was selected. The study population was divided into \"unlikely FH\" and \"possible FH\" based on the Dutch Lipid Clinic Network criteria, which included a plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and age for onset of cardiac disease. A score of \u22653 points was used as the cutpoint between the 2 groups. Among the study population of 13,174 MI patients, 1,281 (9.7%) had possible FH. These patients were younger (59.1 vs 65.7 years, P \u2264 .0001), had similar levels of comorbidities, and were treated more aggressively with cholesterol-lowering drugs compared with patients with unlikely FH. During a median of 3.3 years of follow-up, the unadjusted and adjusted event rates of recurrent MI were higher in patients with possible FH compared with unlikely FH (16% vs 11%, adjusted hazard ratio 1.28, 95% CI 1.09-1.51, P = .003.). Differences in adjusted all-cause mortality were not statistically significant (17% vs 23%, adjusted hazard ratio 0.89 [0.74-1.04], P = .1).\nCONCLUSION: We found that MI patients with possible FH have higher risk of recurrent MI but similar risk of mortality compared with unlikely FH patients.

        "abstract": "Genetic tests for schizophrenia could introduce both risks and benefits. Little is known about the hopes and expectations of young adults at clinical high-risk for psychosis concerning genetic testing for schizophrenia, despite the fact that these youth could be among those highly affected by such tests. We conducted semistructured interviews with 15 young adults at clinical high-risk for psychosis to ask about their interest, expectations, and hopes regarding genetic testing for schizophrenia. Most participants reported a high level of interest in genetic testing for schizophrenia, and the majority said they would take such a test immediately if it were available. Some expressed far-reaching expectations for a genetic test, such as predicting symptom severity and the timing of symptom onset. Several assumed that genetic testing would be accompanied by interventions to prevent schizophrenia. Participants anticipated mixed reactions on finding out they had a genetic risk for schizophrenia, suggesting that they might feel both a sense of relief and a sense of hopelessness. We suggest that genetic counseling could play an important role in counteracting a culture of genetic over-optimism and helping young adults at clinical high-risk for psychosis understand the limitations of genetic testing. Counseling sessions could also invite individuals to explore how receiving genetic risk information might impact their well-being, as early evidence suggests that some psychological factors help individuals cope, whereas others heighten distress related to genetic test results.",

Unfortunately, to date no strong conclusions can be drawn since they have yielded contradictory results. Therefore, further investigations are necessary to establish the value of KRAS testing in liquid biopsy as prognostic or predictive factor in NSCLC.

Polypharmacy has, however, been associated with increased healthcare costs, adverse drug events, and drug interactions. The current study evaluates the potential medication cost savings of adding personalized pharmacogenetic information to traditional medication management strategies.\nMETHODS: One hundred and twelve long-term care residents completed pharmacogenetic testing for targeted variants in the following genes: CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4/CYP3A5, HTR2A, HTR2C, SLC6A4, SLC6A2 COMT, OPRM1, SLCO1B1, VKORC1 and MTHFR. Following reporting of the IDgenetix Polypharmacy\u00ae test results, an internal medication management assessment was performed by a licensed clinical pharmacist to identify potential opportunities for regimen optimization through medication changes or discontinuations. The medication cost differences before and after the pharmacogenetic-guided review were assessed.\nRESULTS: Medication review following pharmacogenetic result reporting identified 54 patients (48.2%) with a total of 132 drug change recommendations (45 reductions; 87 replacements) and an average of 2.4 proposed medication changes (range 1-6) per patient. Medication cost savings related to the identified reduction and replacement opportunities exceeded the cost of testing and are estimated to be US$ 1300 (year 2016 cost) per patient annually assuming full implementation.\nCONCLUSION: Compared with traditional medication review, pharmacogenetic testing resulted in a 38% increase in the number of patients with current medication change opportunities and also offered valuable genetic information that could be referenced to personalize future prescribing decisions for all patients.",

As a consequence, carriers of a deleterious mutation in these genes may opt for prenatal diagnoses (PND). We studied the uptake of prenatal diagnosis for five hereditary cancer syndromes in the Netherlands. Uptake for retinoblastoma (Rb) was compared with uptake for Von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL), Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS), familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), and hereditary breast ovarian cancer (HBOC). A questionnaire was completed by all nine DNA-diagnostic laboratories assessing the number of independent mutation-positive families identified from the start of diagnostic testing until May 2013, and the number of PNDs performed for these syndromes within these families. Of 187 families with a known Rb-gene mutation, 22 had performed PND (11.8%), this was significantly higher than uptake for FAP (1.6%) and HBOC (<0.2%). For VHL (6.5%) and LFS (4.9%) the difference was not statistically significant. PND for Rb started 3\u00a0years after introduction of diagnostic DNA testing and remained stable over the years. For the other cancer syndromes PND started 10-15\u00a0years after the introduction and uptake for PND showed an increase after 2009. We conclude that uptake of PND for Rb was significantly higher than for FAP and HBOC, but not different from VHL and LFS. Early onset, high penetrance, lack of preventive surgery and perceived burden of disease may explain these differences.",

Clinical problems arise due to either accumulation of substrates that are toxic or interfere with normal function, or deficiency of the products that are used to synthesize essential compounds. There is no report of screening results or confirmed cases of IEM in Mongolia. Only pilot study of newborn screening for congenital hypothyroidism was implemented in Mongolia, where the incidence of congenital hypothyroidism is calculated to be 1:3057 in Mongolia.\nMETHODS: Two hundred twenty-three Mongolian patients, who had developmental delay, psychomotor retardation with unknown cause, seizures, hypotonia or liver dysfunction, were studied. Urinary organic acid analysis was performed in all cases using gas chromatography mass spectrometric (GC/MS) analysis. Blood amino acids and acylcarnitines were checked in the patients who had abnormal GC/MS analyses. Mutation analysis was done in the patients, who were suspected having specific inborn errors of metabolism by mass spectrometric analysis.\nRESULTS: One hundred thirty-nine children had normal urinary organic acid analyses. Thirty one had metabolites of valproic acid, 17 had non- or hypoketotic dicarboxylic aciduria, 14 had tyrosiluria, 12 had ketosis, 4 had elevation of lactate and pyruvate, 3 had increased excretion of urinary glycerol or methylmalonic acids, respectively, and 2 had elevation of phenylacetate and phenyllactate.

        "title": "Genetic Counseling for Couples Seeking Noninvasive Prenatal Testing in Japan: Experiences of Pregnant Women and their Partners.",
        "abstract": "The recent advent of noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) has had a significant impact in the field of prenatal testing. Although reports on pregnant women who used NIPT have accumulated, little is known about the experiences of their male partners. In this study, we assessed the experiences of couples who were expecting a child and undergoing NIPT, with a focus on both the pregnant women and their partners. Questionnaires were administered to 282 participants focusing on their specific experiences at three time points: after pre-test counseling (first visit), when undergoing NIPT (second visit), and when results were received (third visit). Responses were analyzed to assess the differences between pregnant women and their partners. We found that more partners selected \"family\" as their first information source about NIPT and \"my partner\" as the first person to request NIPT than did pregnant women (35.6 vs. 5.9\u00a0%; p\u2009<\u20090.001 and 19.3 vs.1.5\u00a0%; p\u2009<\u20090.001). However, pregnant women more often consulted others including family and friends until undergoing NIPT than their partners (89.1 vs. 54.6\u00a0%; p\u2009<\u20090.001). Our findings suggest that it is important to encourage male partners to be actively involved in the NIPT decision-making process. Differences between pregnant women and their partners should be seriously considered when providing genetic counseling.",

        "abstract": "Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an autosomal dominant disorder. Although genetic testing is an important tool for detecting FH-causing mutations in patients, diagnostic methods for young patients with severe hypercholesterolemia are understudied. This study compares the target exome sequencing (TES) technique with the DNA resequencing array technique on young patients with severe hypercholesterolemia. A total of 20 unrelated patients (mean age 14.8 years) with total cholesterol\u2009>\u200910\u2009mmol/L were included. 12 patient samples were processed by DNA resequencing array, 14 patient samples were processed by TES, and 6 patient samples were processed by both methods. Functional characterization of novel mutations was performed by flow cytometry. The mutation detection rate (MDR) of DNA resequencing array was 75%, while the MDR of TES was 100%. A total of 27 different mutations in the LDLR were identified, including 3 novel mutations and 8 mutations with previously unknown pathogenicity. Functional characterization of c.673delA, c.1363delC, p.Leu575Phe and p.Leu582Phe variants found that all of them are pathogenic. Additionally, 7 patients were diagnosed with Heterozygous FH (HeFH) in which lipid levels were significantly higher than common HeFH patients. This data indicates that TES is a very efficient tool for genetic diagnosis in young patients with severe hypercholesterolemia.",

        "abstract": "Genetic cardiomyopathies are complex diseases with heterogeneous clinical presentation and phenotypes. Early descriptions of cardiomyopathies originated from case studies involving individuals with severe, paradigmatic presentation, which provided insight into the worst-case scenarios of these conditions. With time, improved diagnostic sensitivity and awareness of cardiomyopathies has uncovered a more heterogeneous disease spectrum, including mild phenotypes overlapping with physiological variation. This diagnostic 'grey area' poses important dilemmas, particularly in athletes. Current screening policies have the potential to identify affected individuals at very early stages, leading to effective prevention of cardiomyopathy-related complications such as sudden cardiac death. Conversely, however, some physicians actively impose diagnoses on individuals who perceive themselves to be disease-free. In addition, the high sensitivity of contemporary diagnostic techniques carries a serious risk of misinterpreting physiological variation as disease. In this Review, three of the most common and controversial areas are discussed, including left ventricular hypertrophy; left ventricular dilatation, noncompaction, and fibrosis; and arrhythmias originating from the right ventricle. A systematic and cautious approach is necessary in patients with mild phenotypes suggestive of, but not definitely diagnostic for, cardiomyopathies. Preventing the mislabelling of healthy individuals and overdiagnosis should be a priority, with the aim to combine adequate counselling and optimal protection.",

We evaluated cancer risk perception, screening behaviors, and family communication among relatives of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients with UMMRD. Fifty-one family members of 17 probands with UMMRD completed a questionnaire about cancer risk perception, adherence to Lynch syndrome (LS) screening recommendations, and communication with relatives. Clinical data about the probands were obtained from medical records. Thirty-eight participants (78%) were worried from having cancer and twenty-one participants (42%) had undergone colonoscopy in the past 2\u00a0years, as recommended for LS families. In terms of screening for extracolonic cancers, only two eligible participants (3.9%) were screened for gastric, endometrial (10.0%), and ovarian (9.5%) cancers. Additionally, 5 participants (10%) underwent genetic counseling. Most participants were not told by anyone to be screened for extracolonic cancers (84, 85, and 95% for gastric, ovarian, and endometrial cancers, respectively). A minority of family members of CRC patients with UMMRD follow cancer screening as recommended for LS families. Health care providers should encourage patients with UMMRD to share information on LS-related cancers screening, especially extracolonic cancers, with their relatives.",

Data on GCA roles and attitudes toward different aspects of the GCA position were collected via surveys of CGCs who have worked with GCAs, PDs who have and have not had experience with GCAs in their programs, and GCAs. We analyzed responses from 63 individuals: 27 PDs, 22 CGCs, and 14 GCAs. GCAs' impact on efficiency was calculated via internal analysis of genetic patient volume per genetic counselor within the University of Texas Southwestern (UTSW) patient database prior to, and since the addition of, a GCA to the practice. The response rates for PDs, CGCs, and GCAs were 27\u00a0%, 79\u00a0%, and 61\u00a0%, respectively. Every CGC stated the GCA increased their efficiency. CGCs with a GCA reported a 60\u00a0% average increase in patient volume. This figure was congruent with internal data from the UTSW cancer genetics program (58.5\u00a0% increase). Appropriate responsibilities for GCAs as reported by CGCs and PDs (>90\u00a0%) include: data entry, shipping tests, administrative tasks, research, and ordering supplies. Regarding GCAs delivering test results, there was response variation whether this should be a job duty: 42\u00a0% of CGCs agreed to GCAs delivering negative results to patients, compared to 22\u00a0% of program directors. Twenty-two percent of PDs expressed concern about the job title \"Genetic Counseling Assistant.\" Ninety percent of CGCs felt that GCA was a career path to becoming a CGC, compared to 42\u00a0% of PDs. Eighty-three percent of GCAs who decided to apply to CGC graduate programs were accepted. We conclude the addition of a GCA to a genetic counseling practice contributes to increased efficiency and is one way to expand the reach of the profession.",

Despite the high number of deaths from CaP in the United States, the disease has a protracted natural history and many men diagnosed with CaP will not die of the disease regardless of treatment. Unfortunately, identification of men with truly indolent/ nonaggressive CaP is challenging; limitations of conventional diagnostic modalities diminish the ability of physicians to accurately stage every case of CaP based on biopsy results alone. The resulting uncertainty in prognosis may prompt men with low-risk CaP to proceed to morbid and expensive treatments for an unclear survival benefit. Incorporation of the Genomic Prostate Score (GPS) as part of the decision algorithm for patients with National Comprehensive Cancer Network very low-risk and low-risk cancer led to a substantial increase in uptake of active surveillance and substantial cost savings. GPS provides physicians and patients with an additional tool in assessing personalized risk and helps guide individual decision making.",

This prospective study evaluated whether genetic knowledge in counselees with breast cancer (BC) after a pre-test genetic counseling visit (T1) enhance their feeling of personal control while minimizing distress after the notification of BRCA1/2 result (T2). At T1, 243 (89% response rate) counselees completed questionnaires on genetic knowledge (BGKQ), perceived cancer genetic risk; of which, at T2, 180 (66%) completed the BGKQ again, scales of anxiety/depression, distress specific to genetic risk, and perceived control. Multilevel models were performed accounting for clinician, and testing an effect of knowledge on psychological outcomes according to the adequacy of counselees' perceived genetic predisposition to cancer. The mean knowledge score was moderate at T1, decreased while not significantly differing by BRCA1/2 test result at T2. Knowledge at T1 had no direct effect on psychological outcomes, but in counselees who over-estimated their cancer genetic risk, higher knowledge at T1 predicted higher specific distress at T2. In BC affected counselees who over-estimate their cancer genetic risk, higher BRCA1/2 pre-test genetic knowledge seem to lead to increased specific distress. Identifying these BC affected counselees who over-estimate their genetic cancer risk and helping them to interpret their genetic knowledge instead of providing them with exhaustive genetic information could minimize their distress after test result receipt.",

LD-CF was defined as NBS-negative (negative immunoreactive trypsinogen or no F508del) or NBS-positive but discharged following sweat chloride < 60\u2009mmol/L. Cases of LD-CF were each matched 1:2 with patients with NBS-CF for age, sex, hospital, and exocrine pancreatic status.\nRESULTS: A total of 45 LD-CF cases were identified (39 NBS-negative and 6 NBS-positive) with 90 NBS-CF matched controls. Median age (IQR) of diagnosis for LD-CF and NBS-CF was 1.35 (0.4-2.8) and 0.12 (0.03-0.2) years, respectively (P\u2009<.0001). Estimated incidence of LD-CF was 1 in 45\u2009000 live births. Compared with NBS-CF, LD-CF had more respiratory manifestations at time of diagnosis (66% vs 4%; P\u2009<.0001), a higher rate of hospital admission per year for respiratory illness (0.49 vs 0.2; P\u2009=\u2009.0004), worse lung function (forced expiratory volume in 1 second percentage of predicted, 0.88 vs 0.97; P\u2009=\u2009.007), and higher rates of chronic colonization with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (47% vs 24%; P\u2009=\u2009.01). The LD-CF cohort also appeared to be shorter than NBS-CF controls (mean height z-score -0.65 vs -0.03; P\u2009=\u2009.02).\nCONCLUSIONS: LD-CF, despite NBS, seems to be associated with worse health before diagnosis and worse later growth and respiratory outcomes, thus providing further support for NBS programs for CF.",

It is based on 16 in-depth, semi-structured interviews with people with direct experience of NRGTs. Participants identified as members of Christian or Muslim faith traditions and had been faced with deciding whether or not to make use of novel forms of fertility treatment or genetic testing. The findings show that members of faith groups may experience specific barriers of access, and distinctive ethical difficulties, when considering the use of different forms of NRGTs. Both Christian and Muslim interviewees reported difficulties in obtaining information on the official faith teaching, or found that their faith group had not yet crafted an official position. Participants' needs for information, and the opportunity to discuss the faith implications of their clinical choices, were not being met in either the clinic or the faith setting. This paper concludes that clinics should indicate more clearly their acknowledgement of patients' faith concerns.

It is caused by the expansion of CGG triplet repeat at 5' untranslated region of the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. Since the prevalence rate is quite high in the general population, molecular diagnosis is important to establish the cause and the prenatal diagnosis. At present, there are a number of methods available with their own merits and demerits.\nAIM AND METHODS: Molecular screening of intellectually disabled patients and those with premature ovarian failure with combined triplet repeat primed polymerase chain reaction (TP-PCR) and methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MS-PCR) for establishing the diagnosis of FXS.\nRESULTS: The specificity of the method has been validated with archived previously genotyped samples, facilitating the application of this method in the screening procedure. The combined TP-PCR and MS-PCR approach identified six (10%) of the intellectually disabled cases as full mutation positive, one (4%) of the premature ovarian failure cases as premutation positive, and one (out of two) of the prenatal samples as premutation positive.\nCONCLUSION: The present study concludes that a combined usage of TP-PCR and MS-PCR will be a useful alternative approach to diagnose patients suffering from fragile X syndrome.",

If only those pathogenic CNVs below the classical karyotype resolution are considered, chromosomal microarray testing provided an additional 7,7% diagnostic yield in here reported series. When stratified according to the ultrasound anomalies, the highest percentage of pathogenic CNVs were detected in the group of fetuses with multiple congenital anomalies (16,7%) and lowest in the group of isolated in utero growth restriction (6,3%). In the group of cases with isolated increased nuchal translucency we identified a small interstitial deletion of 16p24.1 involving FOXF1 gene. Prenatal aCGH also provided important insights into cases with seemingly balanced chromosomal rearrangements found on prenatal karyotype, where additional pathogenic CNV were discovered.\nCONCLUSION: Prenatal chromosomal microarray testing significantly increases the diagnostic yield when compared with conventional karyotyping. The highest added value is shown in prenatal diagnostics in fetuses with abnormal ultrasound results. Variants of unknown significance and risk factor CNVs present important challenges and should be discussed with parents in advance, therefore pretest counseling prior to prenatal testing is very important.",

The benefit of genetic testing was predicated upon the fact that early-treatment ranibizumab therapy (baseline vision 20/40-20/80) for NVAMD confers greater patient value than late-treatment (baseline vision \u226420/160). Published genetic data and MARINA Study ranibizumab therapy data were utilized in the analysis. Patient value (quality-of-life gain) and financial value (2012 US real dollar) outcomes were discounted at 3\u00a0% annually.\nRESULTS: Genetic testing-enabled, early-treatment ranibizumab therapy per patient conferred mean 20/40-1 vision, a 0.845 QALY gain and 14.1\u00a0% quality-of-life gain over sham therapy. Late-treatment ranibizumab therapy conferred mean 20/160+2 vision, a 0.250 QALY gain and 4.2\u00a0% quality-of-life gain over sham therapy. The gain from early-treatment over late-treatment was 0.595 QALY (10.0\u00a0% quality-of-life gain). The per-patient cost for genetic testing/closer monitoring was $2205 per screened person, $2.082 billion for the 944,000 estimated new Category 3 AMD patients annually.

In Victoria, Australia, patients with a chromosomal variant of uncertain clinical significance (VUS) referred to a clinical geneticist (CG) for evaluation receive consultation summary letters. While communication of uncertainty has been explored in research to some extent, little has focused on how uncertainty is communicated within consultation letters. We aimed to develop a multi-layered understanding of the ways in which CGs communicate diagnostic uncertainty in consultation summary letters. We used theme-oriented discourse analysis of 49 consultation summary letters and thematic analysis of a focus group involving eight CGs. Results showed that CGs have become more confident in their description of VUS as 'contributing factors' to patients' clinical features, but remain hesitant to assign definitive causality. CGs displayed strong epistemic stance when discussing future technological improvements to provide hope and minimise potentially disappointing outcomes for patients and families. CGs reported feeling overwhelmed by their workload associated with increasing numbers of patients with VUS, and this has led to a reduction in the number of review appointments offered over time. This study provides a rich description of the content and process of summary letters discussing VUS. Our findings have implications for letter-writing and workforce management. Furthermore, these findings may be of relevance to VUS identified by genomic sequencing in clinical practice.",

This article aims to understand what factors influence DBS decision-making criteria and how conditions are assessed against them. In doing so, it offers unique insights into the international landscape of DBS. A systematic review on DBS criteria in scientific literature was first undertaken. Through this, five topics were identified for consideration when analyzing DBS decision-making. Using these five topics as a template, a side-by-side comparison was conducted on DBS in policy documents of eight countries. Programs are using different approaches to explore the same policy issues, including: the beneficiary of DBS, definition of criteria, the way conditions are assessed, level of evidence required, and recommendations after assessment. These differences have the potential to result in increased disparity across DBS internationally. Ultimately, governments need to decide on their role and develop an approach to DBS decision-making in line with this role. The analyses presented in this article highlight that despite programs' commonalities, no one 'DBS decision-making solution' exists. Understanding the different approaches to decision-making within the literature and policy settings, provides an objective starting point for structured decision-making approaches for DBS programs.",

        "title": "Differences in pregnancy outcomes in donor egg frozen embryo transfer (FET) cycles following preimplantation genetic screening (PGS): a single center retrospective study.",
        "abstract": "PURPOSE: This study aims to test the hypothesis, in a single-center retrospective analysis, that live birth rates are significantly different when utilizing preimplantation genetic screening (PGS) compared to not utilizing PGS in frozen-thawed embryo transfers in our patients that use eggs from young, anonymous donors. The question therefore arises of whether PGS is an appropriate intervention for donor egg cycles.\nMETHODS: Live birth rates per cycle and live birth rates per embryo transferred after 398 frozen embryo transfer (FET) cycles were examined from patients who elected to have PGS compared to those who did not. Blastocysts derived from donor eggs underwent trophectoderm biopsy and were tested for aneuploidy using array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) or next-generation sequencing (NGS), then vitrified for future use (test) or were vitrified untested (control). Embryos were subsequently warmed and transferred into a recipient or gestational carrier uterus. Data was analyzed separately for single embryo transfer (SET), double embryo transfer (DET), and for own recipient uterus and gestational carrier (GC) uterus recipients.\nRESULTS: Rates of implantation of embryos leading to a live birth were significantly higher in the PGS groups transferring two embryos (DET) compared to the no PGS group (GC, 72 vs. 56\u00a0%; own uterus, 60 vs. 36\u00a0%). The live birth implantation rate in the own uterus group for SET was higher in the PGS group compared to the control (58 vs. 36\u00a0%), and this almost reached significance but the live birth implantation rate for the SET GC group remained the same for both tested and untested embryos. Live births per cycle were nominally higher in the PGS GC DET and own uterus SET and DET groups compared to the non-PGS embryo transfers. These differences almost reached significance. The live birth rate per cycle in the SET GC group was almost identical.\nCONCLUSIONS: Significant differences were noted only for DET; however, benefits need to be balanced against risks associated with multiple pregnancies. Results observed for SET need to be confirmed on larger series and with randomized cohorts.",

        "abstract": "Disclaimer: These recommendations are designed primarily as an educational resource for medical geneticists and other healthcare providers to help them provide quality medical services. Adherence to these recommendations is completely voluntary and does not necessarily assure a successful medical outcome. These recommendations should not be considered inclusive of all proper procedures and tests or exclusive of other procedures and tests that are reasonably directed toward obtaining the same results. In determining the propriety of any specific procedure or test, the clinician should apply his or her own professional judgment to the specific clinical circumstances presented by the individual patient or specimen. Clinicians are encouraged to document the reasons for the use of a particular procedure or test, whether or not it is in conformance with this statement. Clinicians also are advised to take notice of the date this statement was adopted and to consider other medical and scientific information that becomes available after that date. It also would be prudent to consider whether intellectual property interests may restrict the performance of certain tests and other procedures.To promote standardized reporting of actionable information from clinical genomic sequencing, in 2013, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) published a minimum list of genes to be reported as incidental or secondary findings. The goal was to identify and manage risks for selected highly penetrant genetic disorders through established interventions aimed at preventing or significantly reducing morbidity and mortality. The ACMG subsequently established the Secondary Findings Maintenance Working Group to develop a process for curating and updating the list over time. We describe here the new process for accepting and evaluating nominations for updates to the secondary findings list. We also report outcomes from six nominations received in the initial 15 months after the process was implemented. Applying the new process while upholding the core principles of the original policy statement resulted in the addition of four genes and removal of one gene; one gene did not meet criteria for inclusion. The updated secondary findings minimum list includes 59 medically actionable genes recommended for return in clinical genomic sequencing. We discuss future areas of focus, encourage continued input from the medical community, and call for research on the impact of returning genomic secondary findings.Genet Med 19 2, 249-255.",

        "title": "Influence of Genotype on Warfarin Maintenance Dose Predictions Produced Using a Bayesian Dose Individualization Tool.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A previously established Bayesian dosing tool for warfarin was found to produce biased maintenance dose predictions. In this study, we aimed (1) to determine whether the biased warfarin dose predictions previously observed could be replicated in a new cohort of patients from 2 different clinical settings, (2) to explore the influence of CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotype on predictive performance of the Bayesian dosing tool, and (3) to determine whether the previous population used to develop the kinetic-pharmacodynamic model underpinning the Bayesian dosing tool was sufficiently different from the test (posterior) population to account for the biased dose predictions.\nMETHODS: The warfarin maintenance doses for 140 patients were predicted using the dosing tool and compared with the observed maintenance dose. The impact of genotype was assessed by predicting maintenance doses with prior parameter values known to be altered by genetic variability (eg, EC50 for VKORC1 genotype). The prior population was evaluated by fitting the published kinetic-pharmacodynamic model, which underpins the Bayesian tool, to the observed data using NONMEM and comparing the model parameter estimates with published values.\nRESULTS: The Bayesian tool produced positively biased dose predictions in the new cohort of patients (mean prediction error [95% confidence interval]; 0.32 mg/d [0.14-0.5]). The bias was only observed in patients requiring \u22657 mg/d. The direction and magnitude of the observed bias was not influenced by genotype. The prior model provided a good fit to our data, which suggests that the bias was not caused by different prior and posterior populations.\nCONCLUSIONS: Maintenance doses for patients requiring \u22657 mg/d were overpredicted. The bias was not due to the influence of genotype nor was it related to differences between the prior and posterior populations. There is a need for a more mechanistic model that captures warfarin dose-response relationship at higher warfarin doses.",

PGD is a multi-step procedure that requires close collaboration between gynaecologists who are experts in assisted reproduction, embryologists who are experts in micromanipulation of germ cells and in embryo biopsy and geneticists who are experts in genetic analysis at the single-cell level. PGD can be applied as a form of early pre-natal diagnosis with the aim to establish a pregnancy unaffected by a haemoglobinopathy. In addition, PGD can identify embryos that are human leukocyte antigen compatible with an existing sibling affected by a haemoglobinopathy to support a haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. PGD has an advantage over conventional pre-natal diagnosis as it precludes the need to consider terminating an affected ongoing pregnancy. However, PGD is a multi-step, complex and costly procedure with an unpredictable outcome and thus is most suited for couples with an unsuccessful reproductive history or challenging reproductive status. In addition, PGD supports the cure of an affected child. Couples who decide to undergo a PGD cycle should be fully aware of the advantages and limitations. The three teams of health practitioners involved (gynaecologists, embryologists and geneticists) should thoroughly counsel the couples and provide support at all the stages: the initial evaluation of their genetic and reproductive status, all steps of assisted reproduction, embryo biopsy, genetic analysis and, when relevant, follow-up of pregnancy and baby(ies) delivered.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) deficiency is a representative disorder of fatty acid oxidation and is one of the most prevalent inborn errors of metabolism among Caucasian populations. In Japan, however, it was as late as 2000 when the first patient was found, and enzymatic and genetic evaluation of MCAD deficiency began.\nMETHODS: We measured octanoyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity in lymphocytes of symptomatic children and newborn screening (NBS)-positive subjects who showed elevated levels of C8-acylcarnitine in blood. The results were further confirmed by direct sequencing of the ACADM gene.\nRESULTS: The disease was diagnosed in 9 out of 18 symptomatic children. The affected patients showed residual activities from 0% to 3% of the normal average value, except for one patient with 10% activity. Concerning 50 NBS-positive subjects, 18 with enzymatic activities around 10% or lower and 14 with activities ranging from 13% to 30% were judged to be affected patients, and biallelic variants were detected in most of the cases tested. Newborns with higher enzymatic activities were estimated to be heterozygous carriers or healthy subjects, though biallelic variants were detected in 5 of them. Genetic analysis detected 22 kinds of variant alleles. The most prevalent was c.449_452delCTGA (p.T150Rfs), which was followed by c.50G>A (p.R17H), c.1085G>A (p.G362E), c.157C>T (p.R53C), and c.843A>T (p.R281S); these five variants accounted for approximately 60% of all the alleles examined.\nCONCLUSION: Our study has revealed the unique genetic backgrounds of MCAD deficiency among Japanese, based on the largest series of non-Caucasian cases. A continuous spectrum of severity was also observed in our series of NBS-positive cases, suggesting that it is essential for every nation and ethnic group to accumulate its own information on gene variants, together with their enzymatic evaluation, in order to establish an efficient NBS system for MCAD deficiency.",

        "abstract": "Phaeochromocytomas and paragangliomas (PPGLs) are neural-crest-derived tumours of the sympathetic or parasympathetic nervous system that are often inherited and are genetically heterogeneous. Genetic testing is recommended for patients with these tumours and for family members of patients with hereditary forms of PPGLs. Due to the large number of susceptibility genes implicated in the diagnosis of inherited PPGLs, next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology is ideally suited for carrying out genetic screening of these individuals. This Consensus Statement, formulated by a study group comprised of experts in the field, proposes specific recommendations for the use of diagnostic NGS in hereditary PPGLs. In brief, the study group recommends target gene panels for screening of germ line DNA, technical adaptations to address different modes of disease transmission, orthogonal validation of NGS findings, standardized classification of variant pathogenicity and uniform reporting of the findings. The use of supplementary assays, to aid in the interpretation of the results, and sequencing of tumour DNA, for identification of somatic mutations, is encouraged. In addition, the study group launches an initiative to develop a gene-centric curated database of PPGL variants, with annual re-evaluation of variants of unknown significance by an expert group for purposes of reclassification and clinical guidance.",

The goal of this project was to explore OB/GYNs' views on the ethical issues surrounding PWGS and their preparedness for counseling patients on its use.\nMETHODS: A national survey was administered to 2500 members of American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.\nRESULTS: A total of 1114 respondents completed the survey (response rate\u2009=\u200945%). OB/GYNs are most concerned with ordering non-medical fetal genetic information, are worried about increasing parental anxiety, and feel it is appropriate to be directive when counseling parents about PWGS. Furthermore, most OB/GYNs have limited knowledge of genetics, rely heavily on genetic counselors and would like more guidance regarding the clinical adoption of PWGS.\nCONCLUSION: OB/GYNs do not completely accept or reject PWGS, but a substantial number have significant ethical and practical concerns. They are most concerned with issues that will directly affect their practices and interactions with patients, such as increasing parental anxiety and costs of care. Professional guidance would be instrumental in directing the adoption of PWGS and alleviating the ethical burden posed by PWGS on individual OB/GYNs. Published 2016.

We evaluate the ability of a targeted next-generation sequencing panel to detect MMR-D and MSI-H based on\u00a0mutational phenotype. Using a criterion of >40 total mutations per megabase or >5 single-base insertion or deletion mutations in repeats per megabase, sequencing achieves 92% sensitivity and 100% specificity for MMR-D by immunohistochemistry in a training cohort of 149 colorectal carcinomas and 91% sensitivity and 98% specificity for MMR-D in a validation cohort of 94 additional colorectal carcinomas. False-negative samples are attributable to tumor heterogeneity, and next-generation sequencing results are concordant with analysis of microsatellite loci by PCR. In a subset of 95 carcinomas with microsatellite analysis, sequencing achieves 100% sensitivity and 99% specificity for MSI-H in the combined training and validation set. False-positive results for MMR-D and MSI-H are attributable to ultramutated cancers with POLE mutations, which are confirmed by direct sequencing of the POLE gene and are detected by mutational signature analysis. These findings provide a framework for a targeted tumor sequencing panel to accurately detect MMR-D and MSI-H in colorectal carcinomas.",

        "abstract": "Identification and characterization of genetic alterations are essential for diagnosis of multiple myeloma and may guide therapeutic decisions. Currently, genomic analysis of myeloma to cover the diverse range of alterations with prognostic impact requires fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), single nucleotide polymorphism arrays, and sequencing techniques, which are costly and labor intensive and require large numbers of plasma cells. To overcome these limitations, we designed a targeted-capture next-generation sequencing approach for one-step identification of IGH translocations, V(D)J clonal rearrangements, the IgH isotype, and somatic mutations to rapidly identify risk groups and specific targetable molecular lesions. Forty-eight newly diagnosed myeloma patients were tested with the panel, which included IGH and six genes that are recurrently mutated in myeloma: NRAS, KRAS, HRAS, TP53, MYC, and BRAF. We identified 14 of 17 IGH translocations previously detected by FISH and three confirmed translocations not detected by FISH, with the additional advantage of breakpoint identification, which can be used as a target for evaluating minimal residual disease. IgH subclass and V(D)J rearrangements were identified in 77% and 65% of patients, respectively. Mutation analysis revealed the presence of missense protein-coding alterations in at least one of the evaluating genes in 16 of 48 patients (33%).

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Three different precision medicine practice models developed by oncology pharmacists are described, including strategies for implementation and recommendations for educating the next generation of oncology pharmacy practitioners.\nSUMMARY: Oncology is unique in that somatic mutations can both drive the development of a tumor and serve as a therapeutic target for treating the cancer. Precision medicine practice models are a forum through which interprofessional teams, including pharmacists, discuss tumor somatic mutations to guide patient-specific treatment. The University of Wisconsin, Indiana University, and Moffit Cancer Center have implemented precision medicine practice models developed and led by oncology pharmacists. Different practice models, including a clinic, a clinical consultation service, and a molecular tumor board (MTB), were adopted to enhance integration into health systems and payment structures. Although the practice models vary, commonalities of three models include leadership by the clinical pharmacist, specific therapeutic recommendations, procurement of medications for off-label use, and a research component. These three practice models function as interprofessional training sites for pharmacy and medical students and residents, providing an important training resource at these institutions. Key implementation strategies include interprofessional involvement, institutional support, integration into clinical workflow, and selection of model by payer mix.\nCONCLUSION: MTBs are a pathway for clinical implementation of genomic medicine in oncology and are an emerging practice model for oncology pharmacists. Because pharmacists must be prepared to participate fully in contemporary practice, oncology pharmacy residents must be trained in genomic oncology, schools of pharmacy should expand precision medicine and genomics education, and opportunities for continuing education in precision medicine should be made available to practicing pharmacists.",

Pharmacists have assumed important roles in implementing inpatient pharmacogenetics programs. This includes programs designed to incorporate genetic test results to optimize antiplatelet drug selection after percutaneous coronary intervention and personalize warfarin dosing. Pharmacist involvement occurs on many levels, including championing and leading pharmacogenetics implementation efforts, establishing clinical processes to support genotype-guided therapy, assisting the clinical staff with interpreting genetic test results and applying them to prescribing decisions, and educating other healthcare providers and patients on genomic medicine. The three inpatient pharmacogenetics programs described use reactive versus preemptive genotyping, the most feasible approach under the current third-party payment structure. All three sites also follow Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium guidelines for drug therapy recommendations based on genetic test results.\nCONCLUSION: With the clinical emergence of pharmacogenetics into the inpatient setting, it is important that pharmacists caring for hospitalized patients are well prepared to serve as experts in interpreting and applying genetic test results to guide drug therapy decisions. Since genetic test results may not be available until after patient discharge, pharmacists practicing in the ambulatory care setting should also be prepared to assist with genotype-guided drug therapy as part of transitions in care.",

Informatics, especially CDS in the electronic health record (EHR), is a critical tool for the integration of pharmacogenomics into routine patient care. Effective integration of pharmacogenomic CDS into the EHR can address implementation challenges, including the increasing volume of pharmacogenomic clinical knowledge, the enduring nature of pharmacogenomic test results, and the complexity of interpreting results. Both passive and active CDS provide point-of-care information to clinicians that can guide the systematic use of pharmacogenomics to proactively optimize pharmacotherapy. Key considerations for a successful implementation have been identified; these include clinical workflows, identification of alert triggers, and tools to guide interpretation of results. These considerations, along with emerging resources from the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium and the National Academy of Medicine, are described.\nCONCLUSION: The EHR with CDS is essential to curate pharmacogenomic data and disseminate patient-specific information at the point of care. As part of the successful implementation of pharmacogenomics into clinical settings, all relevant clinical recommendations pertaining to gene-drug pairs must be summarized and presented to clinicians in a manner that is seamlessly integrated into the clinical workflow of the EHR.

One factor that has inhibited the adoption of genetic data to guide medication use is a lack of knowledge of how to translate genetic test results into clinical action based on currently available evidence. Other implementation challenges include controversy over selection of appropriate evidentiary thresholds for routine clinical implementation of pharmacogenetic data and the difficulty of compiling scientific data to support clinical recommendations given that large randomized controlled trials to demonstrate the utility of pharmacogenetic testing are not feasible or are not considered necessary to establish clinical utility. Organizations such as the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) and the Pharmacogenomics Knowledgebase (PharmGKB) systematically evaluate emerging evidence of pharmacogenomic linkages and publish evidence-based prescribing recommendations to inform clinical practice. Both CPIC and PharmGKB provide online resources that facilitate the interpretation of genetic test results and provide prescribing recommendations for specific gene-drug pairs.\nCONCLUSION: Resources provided by organizations such as CPIC and PharmGKB, which use standardized approaches to evaluate the literature and provide clinical guidance for a growing number of gene-drug pairs, are essential for the implementation of pharmacogenetics into routine clinical practice.",

However, whole genome testing, tumor marker testing, and testing for drug metabolism are additional costs to the healthcare system. In order to justify these costs, payers and health technology assessment bodies must evaluate the individual tests or groups of tests on their own merits. In order for a test to be covered by payers, test developers must demonstrate clinical utility as measured by improved outcomes or well-informed decision-making. In the United States, payers generally focus on clinical benefit to individual patients and benefits to the healthcare system. Clinical benefits include improved outcomes. Benefits to the healthcare system are generally considered to be cost offsets, which may be due to reductions in the use of unnecessary interventions or to more efficient use of resources. Provider organizations have been assuming more responsibility and liability for healthcare costs through various risk arrangements, including accountable care organizations and patient-centered medical homes. Diagnostic tests that increase efficiency, reduce unnecessary interventions, and improve outcomes will be chosen by specialists in provider organizations.\nCONCLUSION: For personalized medicine approaches to be adopted and covered by health plans, the methods must be shown to be analytically and clinically valid and provide clinical utility at a reasonable level of cost-effectiveness to payers.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Women carrying the mutated BRCA gene, have approximately an 80% life-time risk of developing breast cancer with 50% risk of their children inheriting the gene mutation. Many parents find it difficult to know when and how to disclose this information to their children and how such disclosure might affect their child's future decision-making.\nMETHOD: This study explored the communication of genetic risk information in families using qualitative semi-structured interviews conducted with parents, children (7-11years) and young people (12-18years) affected or at risk from a BRCA gene mutation. Thematic analysis was applied to coded transcripts producing four themes; family communication, perception of cancer risks, risk management strategies and impact of genetic risk communication in children and young people's decision making.\nRESULTS: Twenty-seven individuals from 11 families took part, recruited through purposive sampling techniques. Cancer risk caused by a BRCA gene mutation induced a sense of fear in parents about their children's future. As a result, parents with hereditary breast cancer disclosed limited information about the risks associated with prophylactic surgery and/or the psychological and emotional impacts of surgery on body image. This had implications to children and young people's perceptions of prophylactic procedures, which were already influenced by cultural understandings of the 'desirable body' and increasing acceptance and proliferation cosmetic surgery.\nCONCLUSION: Lack of risk management information and the acculturation of cosmetic surgery combined to limit children and young people's understanding of the impact of hereditary breast cancer; reducing their ability to actualise the physiological, psychological and emotional consequences of surgery.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Targeted therapy significantly prolongs survival in lung adenocarcinoma. Current diagnostic guidelines include only EGFR and anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase gene (ALK) testing. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) reveals more actionable genomic alterations than do standard diagnostic methods. Data on the influence of hybrid capture (HC)-based NGS on treatment are limited, and we investigated its impact on treatment decisions and clinical outcomes.\nMETHODS: This retrospective study included patients with advanced lung cancer on whom HC-based NGS was performed between November 2011 and October 2015. Demographic and clinicopathologic characteristics, treatments, and outcome data were collected.\nRESULTS: A total of 101 patients were included (median age 63 years [53% females, 45% never-smokers, and 85% with adenocarcinoma]). HC-based NGS was performed upfront and after EGFR/ALK testing yielded negative or inconclusive results in 15% and 85% of patients, respectively. In 51.5% of patients, HC-based NGS was performed before first-line therapy, and in 48.5%, it was performed after treatment failure. HC-based NGS identified clinically actionable genomic alterations in 50% of patients, most frequently in EGFR (18%), Ret proto-oncogene (RET) (9%), ALK (8%), Mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (MET) receptor tyrosine kinase gene (6%), and erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2 gene (ERBB2) (5%). In 15 patients, it identified EGFR/ALK aberrations after negative results of prior standard testing. Treatment strategy was changed for 43 patients (42.6%). The overall response rate in these patients was 65% (complete response 14.7%, partial response 50%). Median survival was not reached. Immunotherapy was administered in 33 patients, mostly without an actionable driver, with a presenting disease control rate of 32%, and with an association with tumor mutation burden.\nCONCLUSIONS: HC-based NGS influenced treatment decisions in close to half of the patients with lung adenocarcinoma and was associated with an overall response rate of 65%, which may translate into a survival benefit.",

        "abstract": "For many years, familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), an inherited disorder, has been diagnosed using phenotypic features plus family history of early onset cardiovascular disease (CVD), and has been successfully treated using statin therapy. DNA testing is now available and this has been incorporated into familial cascade screening programmes in many parts of Europe. Little is known about patients' perceptions of the value of undergoing molecular diagnosis for FH. In-depth interviews were carried out with patients (n\u00a0=\u00a038) being treated for FH who were the first in their family to undergo DNA testing for FH. Data were analysed thematically. While interviewees regarded DNA testing as an unexceptional event, it was seen as a positive innovation because it confirmed that their family carried a particular disorder, offered an aetiological explanation for their hypercholesterolemia and provided information about their own and family members' future risks. From the patient perspective, the main benefit of molecular diagnosis lies in its ability to provide information which allows (younger) family members to access genetic screening and, thus, timely treatment. The implications for future developments in genetic services and the need to investigate further the provision of molecular testing in mainstream specialties are briefly discussed.",

However, Black women are less likely to know about HBOC and genetic testing. Based on a request from a community advisory panel of breast cancer survivors, community leaders and healthcare providers in the Black community, our team developed a culturally targeted educational brochure to promote awareness of HBOC among Black women.\nMETHODS: To reach the target population we utilized a passive dissemination strategy. Using Diffusion of Innovations (DOI) as a framework, we traced dissemination of the brochure over a five year period using self-addressed postcards contained inside the brochure that included several open-ended questions about the utility of the brochure, and a field for written comments. Closed-ended responses were analyzed using descriptive statistics and thematic analysis was conducted on the open-ended responses.\nRESULTS: DOI captured the proliferation of the brochure among Black women across the US.\nPRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: The use of passive dissemination strategies among pre-existing social networks proved to be a useful and sustainable method for increasing knowledge of HBOC among Black women.",

        "abstract": "Lynch syndrome (LS) and familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) are major sources of hereditary colorectal cancer (CRC) and are associated with other malignancies. There is some heterogeneity in management strategies in Japan. We undertook a survey of management of hereditary CRC in hospitals that are members of the Japan Society of Colorectal Cancer Research. One hundred and ninety departments responded, of which 127 were from designated cancer care hospitals (DCCHs) according to the Japanese government. There were 25 488 operations for CRC in these departments in 2015. The DCCHs performed better with regard to usage of Japan Society of Colorectal Cancer Research guidelines, referring new CRC patients for LS screening, and having in-house genetic counselors and knowledge of treatment for LS. There were 174 patients diagnosed with LS and 602 undergoing follow-up in 2011-2015, which is fewer than the number expected from CRC operations in 2015. These numbers were not affected by whether the institution was a DCCH. Universal screening for LS was carried out in 8% of the departments. In contrast, 541 patients were diagnosed with FAP and 273 received preventive proctocolectomy/colectomy in 2011-2015. The DCCH departments undertook more surgery than non-DCCH departments, although most of the management, including surgical procedures and use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, was similar. Management of desmoid tumor in the abdominal cavity differed according to the number of patients treated. In conclusion, there was heterogeneity in management of LS but not FAP. Most patients with LS may be overlooked and universal screening for LS is not common in Japan.",

And for those genomic regions covered by the design of the NGS panel, the analytical sensitivity and analytical specificity for all potentially pathogenic variants were both 100% and showed 100% concordance with clinically validated Sanger sequencing results in five major LQTS genes (KCNQ1, KCNH2, SCN5A, KCNE1, and KCNE2).\nCONCLUSION: This is the first description of an NGS panel targeting a multi-gene panel of 13 LQTS-associated genes.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Recently, a growing number of novel genetic defects underlying primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs) have been identified, increasing the number of PID up to more than 250 well-defined forms. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies and proper filtering strategies greatly contributed to this rapid evolution, providing the possibility to rapidly and simultaneously analyze large numbers of genes or the whole exome.\nOBJECTIVE: To evaluate the role of targeted NGS and whole exome sequencing (WES) in the diagnosis of a case series, characterized by complex or atypical clinical features suggesting a PID, difficult to diagnose using the current diagnostic procedures.\nMETHODS: We retrospectively analyzed genetic variants identified through targeted NGS or WES in 45 patients with complex PID of unknown etiology.\nRESULTS: Forty-seven variants were identified using targeted NGS, while 5 were identified using WES. Newly identified genetic variants were classified into four groups: (I) variations associated with a well-defined PID, (II) variations associated with atypical features of a well-defined PID, (III) functionally relevant variations potentially involved in the immunological features, and (IV) non-diagnostic genotype, in whom the link with phenotype is missing. We reached a conclusive genetic diagnosis in 7/45 patients (~16%). Among them, four patients presented with a typical well-defined PID. In the remaining three cases, mutations were associated with unexpected clinical features, expanding the phenotypic spectrum of typical PIDs. In addition, we identified 31 variants in 10 patients with complex phenotype, individually not causative per se of the disorder.\nCONCLUSION: NGS technologies represent a cost-effective and rapid first-line genetic approach for the evaluation of complex PIDs. WES, despite a moderate higher cost compared to targeted, is emerging as a valuable tool to reach in a timely manner, a PID diagnosis with a considerable potential to draw genotype-phenotype correlation. Nevertheless, a large fraction of patients still remains without a conclusive diagnosis. In these patients, the sum of non-diagnostic variants might be proven informative in future studies with larger cohorts of patients.",

Genetic analyses of acid \u03b2-glucosidase (GBA) gene using different techniques were performed to search for new mutations, in addition to those previously and most frequently found in the Spanish population. Additionally, the study of the chitotriosidase (CHIT1) gene was used to assess the inflammatory status of patients in the follow-up of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). We present the genetic data gathered during the last nine years at FJD.\nMETHODS: Blood samples from patients with suspected GD were collected for enzymatic and genetic analyses. The genetic analysis was performed on DNA from 124 unrelated suspected cases and 57 relatives from 2007 to 2015, starting with a mutational screening kit, followed by Sanger sequencing of the entire gene and other techniques to look for deletions. CHIT1 was also studied to assess the reliability of this biomarker.\nRESULTS: In 46 out of 93 GD patients (49.5%) the two mutant alleles were found. We detected 21 different mutations. The most common mutation was N370S (c.126A\u00a0&gt;\u00a0G; p.Asp409Ser current nomenclature) (in 50.5% of patients), followed by L444P (c.1448T\u00a0&gt;\u00a0C; p.Leu483Pro current nomenclature) (in 24.7%). The most common heterozygous compound genotype observed (18.3%) was c.1226A\u00a0&gt;\u00a0G/c.1448T\u00a0&gt;\u00a0C (N370S/L444P). Two novel mutations were found (del.

CC pathogenesis is triggered when human papillomavirus (HPV) inserts into the genome, resulting in tumour suppressor gene inactivation and oncogene activation. Collecting tumour and blood samples is critical for identifying these genetic alterations.\nMETHODS: BIO-RAIDs is the first prospective molecular profiling clinical study to include a substantial biobanking effort that used uniform high-quality standards and control of samples. In this European Union (EU)-funded study, we identified the challenges that were impeding the effective implementation of such a systematic and comprehensive biobanking effort.\nRESULTS: The challenges included a lack of uniform international legal and ethical standards, complexities in clinical and molecular data management, and difficulties in determining the best technical platforms and data analysis techniques. Some difficulties were encountered by all investigators, while others affected only certain institutions, regions, or countries.\nCONCLUSIONS: The results of the BIO-RAIDs programme highlight the need to facilitate and standardise regulatory procedures, and we feel that there is also a need for international working groups that make recommendations to regulatory bodies, governmental funding agencies, and academic institutions to achieve a proficient biobanking programme throughout EU countries.

To the authors' knowledge, the clinicopathologic and genomic predictors of OM-CRC are poorly characterized and optimal clinical management remains unclear.\nMETHODS: Women with a histopathological diagnosis of OM-CRC who were treated at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center from 1999 to 2015 were identified. Next-generation somatic mutation profiling (Memorial Sloan Kettering-Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets [MSK-IMPACT]) was performed on 38 OM-CRC cases, including 21 matched tumor pairs/trios. Regression models were used to analyze variables associated with progression-free survival and overall survival (OS).\nRESULTS: Kirsten Rat Sarcoma Viral Oncogene Homolog (KRAS), SMAD family member 4 (SMAD4), and neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase 1 (NTRK1) mutations were more frequent in cases of OM-CRC than in instances of CRC occurring without OM. SMAD4 and lysine methyltransferase 2D (KMT2D) mutations were associated with reduced OS. Matched multisite tumor sequencing did not identify OM-specific genomic alterations. Of the 195 patients who underwent oophorectomy for OM-CRC (median age, 49 years with a progression-free survival of 9.4 months and an OS of 23 months from oophorectomy), 76% had extraovarian metastasis (EOM). In multivariable analysis, residual disease after surgery (R2 resection) was associated with worse survival. Patients with EOM were less likely to achieve R0/R1 surgical resection status (complete macroscopic resection without clinical/radiological evidence of disease) (48% vs 94%). However, if R0/R1 resection status was achieved, both patients with (35.9 months vs 12 months) and without (43.2 months vs 14.5 months) EOM were found to have better OS. Among 114 patients with R0/R1 resection status, 23 (20%) had no disease recurrence, including 10 patients (9%) with\u2009>\u20093 years of follow-up.\nCONCLUSIONS: Loss-of-function alterations in SMAD4 are frequent and predictive of worse survival in patients with OM-CRC. Similar to oligometastatic CRC to the lung or liver, surgical resection of OM-CRC is associated with a better outcome only if all macroscopic metastatic disease is resected.

Almost all participants (95%) were aware that Noninvasive Prenatal Testing (NIPT) results may suggest maternal neoplasm, and 77% reported they would disclose such results. However, only 29% routinely communicate this possibility to patients in a pre-test setting. Management recommendations made by counselors were highly variable, and over half (51.8%) stated they would feel uncomfortable or very uncomfortable counseling a patient with these results. While less than half (44.3%) believed the current benefits of NIPT's ability to suggest maternal neoplasm outweigh its potential harms, 80.2% recognized it would be beneficial in the future.

In women at increased breast cancer risk for genetic predisposition or positive family history, data regarding these risk factors are limited or conflicting, and recommendations for these categories are unclear. We evaluated the characteristics of reproductive life in 2522 women at increased genetic or familial breast cancer risk attending our Family Cancer Center. Breast cancers in BRCA mutation carriers were more likely to be hormone receptor negative, diagnosed at 35 years or before and multiple during the lifetime than tumors in women at increased familial risk, while the distribution of invasive cancers and HER2 positive tumors was similar in the different risk groups. At least one full-term pregnancy (HR 0.27; 95% CI 0.12-0.58; p = 0.001), breastfeeding either less (HR 0.24; 95% CI 0.09-0.66; p = 0.005) or more (HR 0.25; 95% IC 0.08-0.82; p = 0.022) than one year and late age at menopause (HR 0.10; 95% CI 0.01-0.82; p = 0.033) showed to be protective factors in BRCA mutation carriers, while in women at increased familial risk early age at first full-term pregnancy (HR 0.62; 95% IC 0.38-0.99; p = 0.048) and late menarche (HR 0.61; 95% CI 0.42-0.85; p = 0.004) showed to be the main protective factors.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: As biobanks play an increasing role in the genomic research that will lead to precision medicine, input from diverse and large populations of patients in a variety of health care settings will be important in order to successfully carry out such studies. One important topic is participants' views towards consent and data sharing, especially since the 2011 Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM), and subsequently the 2015 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) were issued by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP). These notices required that participants consent to research uses of their de-identified tissue samples and most clinical data, and allowing such consent be obtained in a one-time, open-ended or \"broad\" fashion. Conducting a survey across multiple sites provides clear advantages to either a single site survey or using a large online database, and is a potentially powerful way of understanding the views of diverse populations on this topic.\nMETHODS: A workgroup of the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network, a national consortium of 9 sites (13 separate institutions, 11 clinical centers) supported by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) that combines DNA biorepositories with electronic medical record (EMR) systems for large-scale genetic research, conducted a survey to understand patients' views on consent, sample and data sharing for future research, biobank governance, data protection, and return of research results.\nRESULTS: Working across 9 sites to design and conduct a national survey presented challenges in organization, meeting human subjects guidelines at each institution, and survey development and implementation. The challenges were met through a committee structure to address each aspect of the project with representatives from all sites. Each committee's output was integrated into the overall survey plan. A number of site-specific issues were successfully managed allowing the survey to be developed and implemented uniformly across 11 clinical centers.\nCONCLUSIONS: Conducting a survey across a number of institutions with different cultures and practices is a methodological and logistical challenge. With a clear infrastructure, collaborative attitudes, excellent lines of communication, and the right expertise, this can be accomplished successfully.",

        "title": "Institutional implementation of clinical tumor profiling on an unselected cancer population.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND. Comprehensive genomic profiling of a patient's cancer can be used to diagnose, monitor, and recommend treatment. Clinical implementation of tumor profiling in an enterprise-wide, unselected cancer patient population has yet to be reported. METHODS. We deployed a hybrid-capture and massively parallel sequencing assay (OncoPanel) for all adult and pediatric patients at our combined cancer centers. Results were categorized by pathologists based on actionability. We report the results for the first 3,727 patients tested. RESULTS. Our cohort consists of cancer patients unrestricted by disease site or stage. Across all consented patients, half had sufficient and available (&gt;20% tumor) material for profiling; once specimens were received in the laboratory for pathology review, 73% were scored as adequate for genomic testing. When sufficient DNA was obtained, OncoPanel yielded a result in 96% of cases. 73% of patients harbored an actionable or informative alteration; only 19% of these represented a current standard of care for therapeutic stratification. The findings recapitulate those of previous studies of common cancers but also identify alterations, including in AXL and EGFR, associated with response to targeted therapies. In rare cancers, potentially actionable alterations suggest the utility of a \"cancer-agnostic\" approach in genomic profiling. Retrospective analyses uncovered contextual genomic features that may inform therapeutic response and examples where diagnoses revised by genomic profiling markedly changed clinical management. CONCLUSIONS. Broad sequencing-based testing deployed across an unselected cancer cohort is feasible. Genomic results may alter management in diverse scenarios; however, additional barriers must be overcome to enable precision cancer medicine on a large scale. FUNDING.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The pathogenicity of many Mendelian variants has been challenged by large-scale sequencing efforts. However, many rare and benign \"disease mutations\" are difficult to analyze due to their rarity. The Saudi Arabian variome is enriched for homozygosity due to inbreeding, a key advantage that can be exploited for the critical examination of previously published variants.\nRESULTS: We collated all \"disease-related mutations\" listed in the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD) and ClinVar, including \"variants of uncertain significance\" (VOUS). We find that the use of public databases including 1000 Genomes, ExAC, and Kaviar can reclassify many of these variants as likely benign. Our Saudi Human Genome Program (SHGP) can reclassify many variants that are rare in public databases. Furthermore, SGPD allows us to observe many previously reported variants in the homozygous state and our extensive phenotyping of participants makes it possible to demonstrate the lack of phenotype for these variants, thus challenging their pathogenicity despite their rarity. We also find that 18 VOUS BRCA1 and BRCA2 variants that are listed in BRCA Exchange are present at least once in the homozygous state in patients who lack features of Fanconi anemia. Reassuringly, we could reciprocally demonstrate that none of those labeled as \"pathogenic\" were observed in the homozygous statue in individuals who lack Fanconi phenotype in our database.\nCONCLUSION: Our study shows the importance of revisiting disease-related databases using public resources as well as of population-specific resources to improve the specificity of the morbid genome of Mendelian diseases in humans.",

The sample included paediatricians who completed medical school in 2006-2008, whose primary specialty was paediatrics or a paediatric subspecialty, and who completed paediatric residency training in 2010-2011. This sample was stratified based on residency programme variables: presence of a formal curriculum in ethics or professionalism, programme size and American Board of Pediatrics certifying exam passage rate. Paediatricians were randomly selected from each stratum for survey participation.\nRESULTS: Among the 370 responding paediatricians (55%), the mean knowledge score was 17.3 (SD 2.2) out of a possible 23. Presence of a formal curriculum in ethics and/or professionalism was not significantly associated with knowledge. Knowledge was lowest on items about parental requests for a child to undergo genetic testing (2 items, 44% and 85% incorrect), preserving patient confidentiality over email (55% incorrect), decision-making regarding life-sustaining technologies (61% incorrect), and decision-making principles such as assent and parental permission (2 items, 47% and 49% incorrect).\nCONCLUSIONS: This study highlights several areas in which paediatricians' knowledge may be low and that are amenable to targeted educational interventions. These findings should prompt discussion and research among ethicists and educators about how ethics and professionalism curricula can more consistently influence paediatricians' knowledge.",

Interviews probed parents' experience with and motivation for WGS as well as their preferences related to SVs. Interviews were analysed thematically.\nRESULTS: Of 83 invited, 23 parents from 18 families participated. These parents supported WGS as a diagnostic test, perceiving clear intrinsic and instrumental value. However, many parents were ambivalent about receiving SVs, conveying a sense of self-imposed obligation to take on the 'weight' of knowing their child's SVs, however unpleasant. Some parents chose to learn about adult-onset SVs for their child but not for themselves.\nCONCLUSIONS: Despite general enthusiasm for WGS as a diagnostic test, many parents felt a duty to learn adult-onset SVs. Analogous to 'inflicted insight', we call this phenomenon 'inflicted ought'. Importantly, not all parents of children undergoing WGS view the best interests of their child in relational terms, thereby challenging an underlying justification for current ACMG guidelines for reporting incidental secondary findings from whole exome and WGS.",

However, clinicians are faced with an enormous volume of often-contradictory evidence regarding the therapeutic context of chemopredictive biomarkers.We extensively surveyed public literature to systematically review the predictive effect of 7 biomarkers claimed to predict response to various chemotherapy drugs: ERCC1-platinums, RRM1-gemcitabine, TYMS-5-fluorouracil/Capecitabine, TUBB3-taxanes, MGMT-temozolomide, TOP1-irinotecan/topotecan, and TOP2A-anthracyclines.

We considered an evidence framework that ranked studies from high level I evidence for randomized controlled trials to low level IV evidence for pre-clinical studies and patient case studies.We found that further in-depth analysis will be required to explore methodological issues, inconsistencies between studies, and tumor specific effects present even within high evidence level studies. Some of these nuances will lend themselves to automation, others will require manual curation. However, the comprehensive cataloging and analysis of dispersed public data utilizing an evidence framework provides a high level perspective on clinical actionability of these protein biomarkers.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Genetic analysis of tissue derived from patients with advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) is not uniformly applied on a national and international level, even though mutational data can provide clinically relevant prognostic and predictive information, especially in patients qualifying for treatment with expensive targeted agents.\nMETHODS: The current article describes the rationale for genetic testing of GIST tissue, looks at financial implications associated with such analysis and speculates on potential cost savings introduced by routine mutational testing and tailored use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors based on genotyping. This work is based on a hypothetical analysis of epidemiological data, drug costs, reimbursement criteria and market research figures.\nRESULTS: The cost burden for routine genotyping of important genes in GISTs, especially in patients at high risk for relapse after primary surgery and in advanced, inoperable metastatic disease, is relatively low. The early identification of GISTs with primary resistance mutations should be the basis for personalized GIST treatment and reimbursement of drugs. As illustrated by Belgian figures, the exclusive use of a drug such as imatinib in patients who are likely to benefit from the agent based on genetic information can lead to significant cost savings, which outweigh the costs for testing.\nCONCLUSIONS: Mutational analysis of GIST should be considered early in all patients at risk for relapse after curative surgery and in the case of advanced, inoperable, metastatic disease. The costs for the actual genotyping should not be used as an argument against profiling of the tumor. The adjuvant and palliative systemic treatment of GISTs should be personalized based on the genotype and other known prognostic and predictive factors. Reimbursement criteria for essential agents such as imatinib should be adapted accordingly.",

A total of 971 participants met criteria and completed a cholesterol screen. In total, five individuals met either the Simon Broome Register or the Dutch Lipid Clinic Network criteria for possible familial hypercholesterolemia. Participants were generally positive towards genetic testing, and the vast majority listed they had no barriers to communication of genetic testing information to family members. However, the most common barrier listed was lack of communication skills. Our results suggest that a public health screening program for FH is viable at a large public venue.

We demonstrate a novel approach to increase the specificity of this marker for WM/LPL diagnosis by combining flow cytometric cell sorting with molecular analysis. Clonal B-lymphocyte and co-occurring clonal plasma cell populations of low-grade B-cell lymphomas were sorted by flow cytometry and analyzed for immunoglobulin gene rearrangements (PCR), and for MYD88 and CXCR4 mutations. Identical clonal origin was confirmed by PCR for 21 LPL/WM cases and MYD88 L265P was detected in both B-cell and plasma cell fractions. 9/20 other B-cell lymphomas with identical light chain restriction on B-cells and plasma cells were genotypically identical by PCR and MYD88 L265P was detected in both cell fractions in 7/9 whereas in 11/20 specimens with different clonal origin, MYD88 L265P was absent (5/11), or only found in B-lymphocytes (4/11), or plasma cells (2/11). CXCR4 mutations were detected in 17/39 cases, but missed in 63% of these without cell sorting. Confirming MYD88L265P in both B-cells and plasma cell fractions can provide a novel and powerful discriminator to distinguish LPL/WM from phenotypically similar disorders. Furthermore, this approach significantly increases CXCR4 detection sensitivity.",

We aimed to evaluate the feasibility of a sequencing and molecular biology tumor board (MBB) program, and its clinical impact on children with solid tumors.\nPROCEDURE: We report on a single-center MBB experience of 60 pediatric patients with a poor prognosis or relapsed/refractory solid tumors screened between October 2014 and November 2015. Tumor molecular profiling was performed with panel-based next-generation sequencing and array comparative genomic hybridization.\nRESULTS: Mean age was 12 \u00b1 5.7 years (range 0.1-21.5); main tumor types were high-grade gliomas (n = 14), rare sarcomas (n = 9), and neuroblastomas (n = 8). The indication was a poor prognosis tumor at diagnosis for 16 patients and relapsed (n = 26) or refractory disease (n = 18) for the remaining 44 patients. Molecular profiling was feasible in 58 patients. Twenty-three patients (40%) had a potentially actionable finding. Patients with high-grade gliomas had the highest number of targetable alterations (57%). Six of the 23 patients subsequently received a matched targeted therapy for a period ranging from 16 days to 11 months.

Although the NGS technology aims to improve the effectiveness of therapies by selecting the most promising therapy, concerns are that NGS testing is expensive and that the 'benefits' are not yet in relation to these costs. In this study, we give an estimation of the costs and an institutional and national budget impact of various types of NGS tests in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and melanoma patients within The Netherlands. First, an activity-based costing (ABC) analysis has been conducted on the costs of two examples of NGS panels (small- and medium-targeted gene panel (TGP)) based on data of The Netherlands Cancer Institute (NKI). Second, we performed a budget impact analysis (BIA) to estimate the current (2015) and future (2020) budget impact of NGS on molecular diagnostics for NSCLC and melanoma patients in The Netherlands. Literature, expert opinions, and a data set of patients within the NKI (n = 172) have been included in the BIA. Based on our analysis, we expect that the NGS test cost concerns will be limited. In the current situation, NGS can indeed result in higher diagnostic test costs, which is mainly related to required additional tests besides the small TGP. However, in the future, we expect that the use of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) will increase, for which it is expected that additional tests can be (partly) avoided. Although the current clinical benefits are expected to be limited, the research potentials of NGS are already an important advantage.",

        "abstract": "Objective\u2003To determine patient perception of residual risk after receiving a negative non-invasive prenatal testing result. Introduction\u2003Recent technological advances have yielded a new method of prenatal screening, non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT), which uses cell-free fetal DNA from the mother's blood to assess for aneuploidy. NIPT has much higher detection rates and positive predictive values than previous methods however, NIPT is not diagnostic. Past studies have demonstrated that patients may underestimate the limitations of prenatal screening; however, patient perception of NIPT has not yet been assessed. Methods and Materials\u2003We conducted a prospective cohort study to assess patient understanding of the residual risk for aneuploidy after receiving a negative NIPT result. Ninety-four participants who had prenatal genetic counseling and a subsequent negative NIPT were surveyed. Results\u2003There was a significant decline in general level of worry after a negative NIPT result (p\u2009=\u2009&lt;0.0001). The majority of participants (61%) understood the residual risk post NIPT. Individuals with at least four years of college education were more likely to understand that NIPT does not eliminate the chance of trisomy 13/18 (p\u2009=\u20090.012) and sex chromosome abnormality (p\u2009=\u20090.039), and were more likely to understand which conditions NIPT tests for (p\u2009=\u20090.021), compared to those women with less formal education. Conclusion\u2003These data demonstrate that despite the relatively recent implementation of NIPT into obstetric practice, the majority of women are aware of its limitations after receiving genetic counseling. However, clinicians may need to consider alternative ways to communicate the limitations of NIPT to those women with less formal education to ensure understanding.",

We conducted a cross-sectional survey among Orthodox Jewish women in New York City to assess breast cancer risk, genetic testing knowledge, self-efficacy, perceived breast cancer risk and worry, religious and cultural factors affecting medical decision-making. We used descriptive statistics and multivariable logistic regression models to identify predictors of genetic testing intention/uptake. Among evaluable respondents (n = 243, 53% response rate), median age was 25 and nearly half (43%) had a family history of breast cancer. Only 49% of the women had adequate genetic testing knowledge and 46% had accurate breast cancer risk perceptions. Five percent had already undergone BRCA genetic testing, 20% stated that they probably/definitely will get tested, 28% stated that they probably/definitely will not get tested, and 46% had not thought about it. High decision self-efficacy, adequate genetic testing knowledge, higher breast cancer risk, and overestimation of risk were associated with genetic testing intention/uptake. Decision support tools that improve knowledge and self-efficacy about genetic testing may facilitate population-based BRCA testing among Orthodox Jews.",

One common health challenge faced by adoptees involves lack of access to genetic-relative family health history (GRFHx). Lack of GRFHx represents a disadvantage due to a reduced capacity to identify diseases and recommend appropriate screening for conditions for which the adopted person may be at increased risk.

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: There is considerable evidence regarding the efficacy and effectiveness of BRCA genetic testing programs, but whether they represent good use of financial resources is not clear. Therefore, we aimed to identify the main health-care programs for BRCA testing and to evaluate their cost-effectiveness.\nMETHODS: We performed a systematic review of full economic evaluations of health-care programs involving BRCA testing.\nRESULTS: Nine economic evaluations were included, and four main categories of BRCA testing programs were identified: (i) population-based genetic screening of individuals without cancer, either comprehensive or targeted based on ancestry; (ii) family history (FH)-based genetic screening, i.e., testing individuals without cancer but with FH suggestive of BRCA mutation; (iii) familial mutation (FM)-based genetic screening, i.e., testing individuals without cancer but with known familial BRCA mutation; and (iv) cancer-based genetic screening, i.e., testing individuals with BRCA-related cancers.\nCONCLUSIONS: Currently BRCA1/2 population-based screening represents good value for the money among Ashkenazi Jews only. FH-based screening is potentially very cost-effective, although further studies that include costs of identifying high-risk women are needed. There is no evidence of cost-effectiveness for BRCA screening of all newly diagnosed cases of breast/ovarian cancers followed by cascade testing of relatives, but programs that include tools for identifying affected women at higher risk for inherited forms are promising. Cost-effectiveness is highly sensitive to the cost of BRCA1/2 testing.Genet Med 18 12, 1171-1180.",

This study aimed to provide a qualitative focus on perspectives of individuals, particularly carriers, who were tested through a screening trial. In this trial, the pretest process included only written information.\nMETHODS: Interviews were performed with 26 carriers and 10 noncarriers who participated in a BRCA population screening trial for AJ.\nRESULTS: Attitudes toward screening were generally positive. The main motivator for testing was knowledge of BRCA status to enable cancer risk reduction. Knowledge of carrier status, although challenging, was thus viewed as health-empowering. The screening paradigm was sensed as increasing awareness and as overcoming access, referral, and familial barriers. Streamlining the pretest process was positively perceived as offering gradual, stepwise knowledge commensurate with test results. Participants were concerned that health systems provide the necessary conceptual and infrastructural framework and that individual autonomy be maintained.\nCONCLUSIONS: BRCA screening in AJ is viewed favorably, even by carriers. Stepwise acquisition of knowledge based on test results was viewed as most relevant to the screening context. Screening program development should account for safeguarding autonomy and providing requisite post-test services.Genet Med advance online publication 01 December 2016.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Little is known about the characteristics of persons with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) younger than 18 years, the lipid-lowering therapy used in these patients, and the lipid goals reached in real life. Our aim was to evaluate the achievement of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) treatment goals in FH patients younger than 18 years enrolled in a large national registry.\nMETHODS: We analyzed patients younger than 18 years enrolled in a large ongoing registry of molecularly-defined patients with FH in Spain. The attainment of guideline-recommended plasma LDL-C goals at entry and follow-up was analyzed in relation to the use of lipid-lowering therapy.\nRESULTS: We enrolled 392 individuals younger than 18 years. Of these, 217 were molecularly-diagnosed FH patients and had a complete follow-up. The median follow-up time was 4.69 years (interquartile range, 2.48-6.38 years), 68.2% of FH patients were on statins, and 41.5% patients had LDL-C < 130mg/dL. Statin use was the only predictor of LDL-C goal attainment.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study shows that a high proportion of FH patients younger than 18 years have high LDL-C levels and fail to achieve recommended LDL-C targets. Statin use was the only independent predictor of LDL-C goal achievement. No safety concerns were detected during follow-up. These results indicate that many FH patients are not adequately controlled and that there is still room for treatment improvement.",

Well-differentiated PPGLs (n\u2009=\u200932), metastatic (n\u2009=\u20094); SDHx mutation (n\u2009=\u200925); 12 biochemically active, Lanreotide treated (n\u2009=\u20094). Nine patients had multiple sampling. Age- and gender-matched controls and GEP-NETs (comparators).\nMETHODS: Circulating neuroendocrine tumor mRNA measured (qPCR) with multianalyte algorithmic analysis. Metabolic, epigenomic and proliferative genes as well as somatostatin receptor expression were assessed (averaged, normalized gene expression: mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009s.e.m.). Amines were measured by HPLC and chromogranin A by ELISA. Analyses (2-tailed): Fisher's test, non-parametric (Mann-Whitney), receiver-operator curve (ROC) and multivariate analysis (MVA). All data are presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009s.e.m.\nRESULTS: PPGL were NETest positive (100%). All exhibited higher scores than controls (55\u2009\u00b1\u20095% vs 8\u2009\u00b1\u20091%, P\u2009=\u20090.0001), similar to GEP-NETs (47\u2009\u00b1\u20095%). ROC analysis area under curve was 0.98 for differentiating PPGLs/controls (cut-off for normal: 26.7%). Mutation status was not directly linked to NETest. Genetic and molecular clustering was associated (P\u2009<\u20090.04) with NETest scores. Metastatic (80\u2009\u00b1\u20099%) and multicentric (64\u2009\u00b1\u20099%) disease had significantly (P\u2009<\u20090.04) higher scores than localized disease (43\u2009\u00b1\u20097%). Progressive disease (PD) had the highest scores (86\u2009\u00b1\u20092%) vs stable (SD, 41\u2009\u00b1\u20092%) (P\u2009<\u20090.0001). The area under the curve for PD from SD was 0.93 (cut-off for PD: 53%). Proliferation, epigenetic and somatostatin receptor gene expression was elevated (P\u2009<\u20090.03) in PD. Metabolic gene expression was decreased in SDHx mutations. Repeat NETest measurements defined clinical status in the 9 patients (6 SD and 3 PD). Amine measurement was non-informative. Multivariate analysis identified NETest >53% as an independent prognostic factor.\nCONCLUSION: Circulating NET transcript analysis is positive (100% diagnostic) in well-differentiated PCC/PGL, scores were elevated in progressive disease irrespective of mutation or biochemical activity and elevated levels were prognostic.",

        "abstract": "Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is a cancer predisposition syndrome that causes early-onset polyposis and is associated with an increased risk for hepatoblastoma. There is currently a lack of consensus on when to order APC (adenomatous polyposis coli) gene testing or implement surveillance for hepatoblastoma. An online questionnaire was completed by 62 genetic counselors to capture their current practices regarding these questions. Extracolonic findings associated with FAP that were most likely to prompt APC testing in an otherwise asymptomatic 10\u00a0year-old child with a negative family history were multiple desmoid tumors, congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium (CHRPE), jaw osteomas, and hepatoblastoma. For hepatoblastoma screening, the majority did recommend this in children less than age five years with known APC mutations. An interval of every 3-6\u00a0months was most commonly suggested; however, responses extended to screening on a less than annual basis. These results highlight the need for further investigation into why some genetic counselors do not recommend APC testing in young at-risk children and what factors influence views about the ideal age and indication for APC testing. Studies of these issues would help to define the best clinical practice model for genetic testing and hepatoblastoma screening in pediatric patients with FAP.",

This study evidenced similar performances in the two BRCAPRO versions even if the CaGene 6.0 has underestimated the genetic risk prediction in some BRCA mutation-positive families.

We review All of Us Research Program plans to address these issues and then identify additional ELSI within each domain that warrant ongoing investigation as the All of Us Research Program develops. We conclude that PMI's All of Us Research Program represents a significant opportunity and obligation to identify, analyze, and respond to ELSI, and we call on the PMI to initiate a research program capable of taking on these challenges.Genet Med advance online publication 01 December 2016.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Population screening of three common BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations in Ashkenazi Jews (AJ) apparently fulfills screening criteria. We compared streamlined BRCA screening via self-referral with proactive recruitment in medical settings.\nMETHODS: Unaffected AJ, age \u226525 years without known familial mutations, were either self-referred or recruiter-enrolled. Before testing, participants received written information and self-reported family history (FH). After testing, both non-carriers with significant FH and carriers received in-person genetic counseling. Psychosocial questionnaires were self-administered 1 week and 6 months after enrollment.\nRESULTS: Of 1,771 participants, 58% were recruiter-enrolled and 42% were self-referred. Screening uptake was 67%. Recruited enrollees were older (mean age 54 vs. 48, P < 0.001) and had less suggestive FH (23 vs. 33%, P < 0.001). Of 32 (1.8%) carriers identified, 40% had no significant FH. Post-test counseling compliance was 100% for carriers and 89% for non-carrier women with FH. All groups expressed high satisfaction (>90%). At 6 months, carriers had significantly increased distress and anxiety, greater knowledge, and similar satisfaction; 90% of participants would recommend general AJ BRCA screening.\nCONCLUSION: Streamlined BRCA screening results in high uptake, very high satisfaction, and no excess psychosocial harm. Proactive recruitment captured older women less selected for FH. Further research is necessary to target younger women and assess other populations.Genet Med advance online publication 08 December 2016.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Screening for congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) caused by 21-\u03b1-hydroxylase deficiency is challenging because factors such as prematurity and stress increase intermediate steroid metabolite levels in newborn infants. The objective of this study was to explore the use of the 17-\u03b1-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP)/11-deoxycortisol ratio as an adjunct measure in the follow-up evaluation of infants with presumptive positive newborn screens for CAH to distinguish between infants with no disorder and those with CAH.\nSTUDY DESIGN: This was a retrospective cohort study of infants with presumptive positive newborn screens for CAH. The precursor-to-product ratio of 17-OHP/11-deoxycortisol was compared between infants with no disorder (n=47) and infants with CAH (n=5).\nRESULTS: The CAH infants had higher 17-OHP/11-deoxycortisol ratios than infants with no disorder: 26 (18 to 58) and 1.05 (0.69 to 1.46), respectively (P<0.05). Among infants with no disorder, higher levels of serum 17-OHP did not reflect higher ratios, indicating sufficient enzyme activity.\nCONCLUSION: The results suggest that a low 17-OHP/11-deoxycortisol ratio represents 21-\u03b1-hydroxylase sufficiency among presumptive positives in newborn screening of CAH.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sudden unexplained death may be the first manifestation of an unknown inherited cardiac disease. Current genetic technologies may enable the unraveling of an etiology and the identification of relatives at risk. The aim of our study was to define the etiology of natural deaths, younger than 50 years of age, and to investigate whether genetic defects associated with cardiac diseases could provide a potential etiology for the unexplained cases.\nMETHODS AND FINDINGS: Our cohort included a total of 789 consecutive cases (77.19% males) <50 years old (average 38.6\u00b112.2 years old) who died suddenly from non-violent causes. A comprehensive autopsy was performed according to current forensic guidelines. During autopsy a cause of death was identified in most cases (81.1%), mainly due to cardiac alterations (56.87%). In unexplained cases, genetic analysis of the main genes associated with sudden cardiac death was performed using Next Generation Sequencing technology. Genetic analysis was performed in suspected inherited diseases (cardiomyopathy) and in unexplained death, with identification of potentially pathogenic variants in nearly 50% and 40% of samples, respectively.\nCONCLUSIONS: Cardiac disease is the most important cause of sudden death, especially after the age of 40. Close to 10% of cases may remain unexplained after a complete autopsy investigation. Molecular autopsy may provide an explanation for a significant part of these unexplained cases. Identification of genetic variations enables genetic counseling and undertaking of preventive measures in relatives at risk.",

Our objective is to retrospectively evaluate whether WGS can facilitate improving prevention and care for patients with susceptibility to cancer syndromes.\nMETHODS AND FINDINGS: We analyzed genetic mutations in 60 autosomal dominant cancer-predisposition genes in 300 deceased patients with WGS data and nearly complete long-term (over 30 years) medical records. To infer biological insights from massive amounts of WGS data and comprehensive clinical data in a short period of time, we developed an in-house analysis pipeline within the SeqHBase software framework to quickly identify pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. The clinical data of the patients who carried pathogenic and/or likely pathogenic variants were further reviewed to assess their clinical conditions using their lifetime EHRs. Among the 300 participants, 5 (1.7%) carried pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in 5 cancer-predisposing genes: one in APC, BRCA1, BRCA2, NF1, and TP53 each. When assessing the clinical data, each of the 5 patients had one or more different types of cancers, fully consistent with their genetic profiles. Among these 5 patients, 2 died due to cancer while the others had multiple disorders later in their lifetimes; however, they may have benefited from early diagnosis and treatment for healthier lives, had the patients had genetic testing in their earlier lifetimes.\nCONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated a case study where the discovery of pathogenic or likely pathogenic germline mutations from population-wide WGS correlates with clinical outcome. The use of WGS may have clinical impacts to improve healthcare delivery.",

The goal of this study was to evaluate the pregnancy outcomes in SL cases and to establish a protocol for pregnancy management, follow-up and additional investigations.\nMETHODS: Fifty seven cases were evaluated: 34 with and 23 without ultrasound anomalies at referral. Each pregnant couple received pretest counseling and extensive posttest genetic counseling.\nRESULTS: After diagnosis of SL, parental testing and an additional ultrasound examination were offered. The severity of the ultrasound anomalies and not the diagnosis of SL was the most important factor contributing to the decision on pregnancy continuation. In the majority of cases with milder or no ultrasound anomalies, the pregnancy was continued and a normal outcome after birth was observed.\nCONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of a SL did not seem to be a reason for termination of pregnancy. Most patients were able to cope with the uncertainty and were interested in both prenatal and postnatal actionability of SL. Long-term follow-up is crucial to assess the actual risks for neurodevelopmental disorders, especially in families with unremarkable history. \u00a9 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Researchers have developed approaches for the noninvasive prenatal testing of single gene diseases. One approach that allows for the noninvasive assessment of both maternally and paternally inherited mutations involves the analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in maternal plasma DNA with reference to parental haplotype information. In the past, parental haplotypes were resolved by complex experimental methods or inferential approaches, such as through the analysis of DNA from other affected family members. Recently, microfluidics-based linked-read sequencing technology has become available and allows the direct haplotype phasing of the whole genome rapidly. We explored the feasibility of applying this direct haplotyping technology in noninvasive prenatal testing.\nMETHODS: We first resolved the haplotypes of parental genomes with the use of linked-read sequencing technology. Then, we identified SNPs within and flanking the genes of interest in maternal plasma DNA by targeted sequencing. Finally, we applied relative haplotype dosage analysis to deduce the mutation inheritance status of the fetus.\nRESULTS: Haplotype phasing and relative haplotype dosage analysis of 12 out of 13 families were successfully achieved. The mutational status of these 12 fetuses was correctly classified.\nCONCLUSIONS: High-throughput linked-read sequencing followed by maternal plasma-based relative haplotype dosage analysis represents a streamlined approach for noninvasive prenatal testing of inherited single gene diseases. The approach bypasses the need for mutation-specific assays and is not dependent on the availability of DNA from other affected family members. Thus, the approach is universally applicable to pregnancies at risk for the inheritance of a single gene disease.",

Diagnosis of any underlying cause is important to ensure effective and prompt management of multisystem complications, to facilitate accurate genetic counselling and to streamline multidisciplinary care. Next generation sequencing (NGS) has been shown to be effective in providing an underlying diagnosis in 70% of patients with CC in a research setting. This project aimed to integrate NGS testing in CC within six months of presentation and increase the rate of diagnosis. A retrospective case note review was undertaken to define the baseline efficacy of current care in providing a precise diagnosis. Quality improvement methods were used to integrate and optimize NGS testing in clinical care and measure the improvements made. The percentage of children receiving an NGS result within six months increased from 26% to 71% during the project period. The mean time to NGS testing and receiving a report decreased and there was a reduction in variation over the study period. Several patients and families had a change in management or genetic counselling as a direct result of the diagnosis given by the NGS test. The current recommended investigation of patients with bilateral CC is ineffective in identifying a diagnosis. Quality Improvement methods have facilitated successful integration of NGS testing into clinical care, improving time to diagnosis and leading to development of a new care pathway.",

Type of genetic mutation and regular physical exercise has an impact on clinical outcome.

Measures about lung function/forced expiratory volume in 1\u2005s per cent predicted, body mass index, physical working capacity, immunoglobulin G, CF Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) mutations, and physical exercise were obtained. structural equation modelling was used to fit models to data.\nRESULTS: A cftr gene mutation\u00d7age interaction effect indicates a psychological disadvantage increasing with age of having more severe CFTR mutations; &gt;65% of the effect is mediated by medical status. Physical exercise has a positive effect on psychological well-being, but &gt;75% of the effect is mediated by medical status.\nCONCLUSIONS: Psychological well-being decreases with age in patients with more severe cftr mutations, to a large extent due to a parallel deterioration of medical status. Physical exercise has a positive effect on psychological well-being if resulting in better health only. To manage the complexity of these patients' needs, the CF-care should emphasise a holistic approach and offer individualised exercise/treatment programmes and psychological competence.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The potential for global collaborations to better inform public health policy regarding major non-communicable diseases has been successfully demonstrated by several large-scale international consortia. However, the true public health impact of familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH), a common genetic disorder associated with premature cardiovascular disease, is yet to be reliably ascertained using similar approaches. The European Atherosclerosis Society FH Studies Collaboration (EAS FHSC) is a new initiative of international stakeholders which will help establish a global FH registry to generate large-scale, robust data on the burden of FH worldwide.\nMETHODS: The EAS FHSC will maximise the potential exploitation of currently available and future FH data (retrospective and prospective) by bringing together regional/national/international data sources with access to individuals with a clinical and/or genetic diagnosis of heterozygous or homozygous FH. A novel bespoke electronic platform and FH Data Warehouse will be developed to allow secure data sharing, validation, cleaning, pooling, harmonisation and analysis irrespective of the source or format. Standard statistical procedures will allow us to investigate cross-sectional associations, patterns of real-world practice, trends over time, and analyse risk and outcomes (e.g. cardiovascular outcomes, all-cause death), accounting for potential confounders and subgroup effects.\nCONCLUSIONS: The EAS FHSC represents an excellent opportunity to integrate individual efforts across the world to tackle the global burden of FH. The information garnered from the registry will help reduce gaps in knowledge, inform best practices, assist in clinical trials design, support clinical guidelines and policies development, and ultimately improve the care of FH patients.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) is characterized by arrested T-lymphocyte production and by B-lymphocyte dysfunction, which result in life-threatening infections. Early diagnosis of SCID through population-based screening of newborns can aid clinical management and help improve outcomes; it also permits the identification of previously unknown factors that are essential for lymphocyte development in humans.\nMETHODS: SCID was detected in a newborn before the onset of infections by means of screening of T-cell-receptor excision circles, a biomarker for thymic output. On confirmation of the condition, the affected infant was treated with allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation. Exome sequencing in the patient and parents was followed by functional analysis of a prioritized candidate gene with the use of human hematopoietic stem cells and zebrafish embryos.\nRESULTS: The infant had \"leaky\" SCID (i.e., a form of SCID in which a minimal degree of immune function is preserved), as well as craniofacial and dermal abnormalities and the absence of a corpus callosum; his immune deficit was fully corrected by hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation. Exome sequencing revealed a heterozygous de novo missense mutation, p.N441K, in BCL11B. The resulting BCL11B protein had dominant negative activity, which abrogated the ability of wild-type BCL11B to bind DNA, thereby arresting development of the T-cell lineage and disrupting hematopoietic stem-cell migration; this revealed a previously unknown function of BCL11B. The patient's abnormalities, when recapitulated in bcl11ba-deficient zebrafish, were reversed by ectopic expression of functionally intact human BCL11B but not mutant human BCL11B.\nCONCLUSIONS: Newborn screening facilitated the identification and treatment of a previously unknown cause of human SCID. Coupling exome sequencing with an evaluation of candidate genes in human hematopoietic stem cells and in zebrafish revealed that a constitutional BCL11B mutation caused human multisystem anomalies with SCID and also revealed a prethymic role for BCL11B in hematopoietic progenitors.

The purpose of this study was to identify prospectively the barriers to universal screening based on a tissue testing approach [microsatellite instability (MSI) analysis, IHC for DNA mismatch repair proteins, and MLH1 methylation analysis]. Endometrial carcinoma patients (n = 213) prospectively underwent microsatellite instability and IHC testing for expression of DNA mismatch repair (MMR) proteins. Patients with low (MSI-L) or high (MSI-H) levels of tumor MSI or immunohistochemical loss of MLH1 (and absent MLH1 methylation), MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 were referred to a genetic counselor for consideration of germline testing. Six discordances (3.1% of tested cases) between IHC and MSI were identified. Half of these exhibited heterogeneous immunohistochemical loss of MLH1/PMS2 and were microsatellite stable (MSS). Of the remaining cases, one was MSS with immunohistochemical loss of MSH6, one was MSS with immunohistochemical loss of MLH1/PMS2 and absent MLH1 promoter methylation, and one was MSI-H with intact expression of DNA MMR proteins. Four patients had MSI-L tumors with intact immunohistochemical protein expression; the clinical significance of MSI-L in endometrial cancer is unclear. Eight patients did not have germline mutations despite tissue testing suggesting Lynch syndrome.

Although genetic testing may reduce previvors' worries about whether or not they have a high genetic cancer risk, testing positive produces negative emotions and long-term uncertainty-thus requiring the management of uncertainty. Existing research indicates family, friends, and social support networks are limited in their assistance for previvors' uncertainty management. Therefore, this study examined how health care providers may assist previvors in uncertainty management by asking: What strategies do BRCA-positive previvors enact with their health care providers to help manage their uncertainty about HBOC? Purposive sampling was employed to recruit participants via online social media. The final sample consisted of 34 BRCA-positive women. Interviews revealed four uncertainty management strategies-seeking health care providers as informational sources, seeking health care providers as partners for decision making, seeking health care providers for supportive communication, and seeking referrals from health care providers for social support networks. Findings indicate that health care providers who are knowledgeable about BRCA, provide information, answer questions, check understanding, and provide additional resources assist previvors in managing their uncertainties by distinguishing options and fostering meaning.",

Respondents rated the value (on a 5-point scale) of each of six possible reasons for genetic testing. Bivariate and linear regressions identified associations between value ratings and environmental, organizational, provider, patient, and encounter characteristics.\nRESULTS: Respondents (n = 353; 63% response rate) represented 92% of VA medical centers. Tests that inform clinical management had the highest value rating (58.6%), followed by tests that inform disease prevention (56.4%), reproductive options (50.1%), life planning (43.9%), and a suspected (39.9%) or established (32.3%) diagnosis. Factors positively associated with high value included a culture that fosters adoption of genomics, specialist versus primary care provider, genetic tests available on laboratory menus, availability of genetic testing guidelines, clinicians knowing when to request genetics referrals, and availability of genetics professionals.\nCONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate the varied value of genetic testing from the perspective of clinical leadership within a health-care system.

        "title": "An evaluation of pregnant women's knowledge and attitudes about newborn bloodspot screening.",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: research suggests that information provided to parents about newborn bloodspot screening (NBS) can be inconsistent. The majority of international NBS programmes recommend that parents should receive information about NBS in the antenatal period, however prior studies have mostly focused on postnatal women's knowledge, with no quantitative study of women's knowledge in the antenatal period conducted to date. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine if antenatal women received information about NBS in the antenatal period and to evaluate their knowledge and attitudes about NBS.\nDESIGN/PARTICIPANTS: we conducted a cross-sectional study among antenatal attendees at three maternity hospitals in Ireland. A total of 662 antenatal women (\u226536 weeks gestation) were recruited into the study (279 primiparous, 368 multiparous). Women were asked to complete a self\u00a0reported knowledge and attitude questionnaire about NBS.\nFINDINGS: primiparity (OR 2.75; 95% CI 1.65, 4.59) lower educational status (OR 1.79; 95% CI 1.02, 3.15) and not having private health insurance (OR 1.84; 95% CI 1.19, 2.85) were independently associated with poor NBS knowledge. Fourteen per cent\u00a0of antenatal women recalled receiving an information leaflet about NBS, yet over 87 % reported that they would like more information. Thirty four per cent of women agreed that they understand everything they need to know about NBS.\nCONCLUSIONS/IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: the process of providing women with information about NBS in the antenatal period is inconsistent; consequently their awareness about NBS is limited. To make an informed choice about NBS women require information to be provided in a more structured format. There are many missed opportunities in the antenatal period for maternity care providers to provide women with information about NBS. Our study recommends that healthcare providers should have a more formal and structured approach with regard to the provision of information about NBS in the antenatal period. This could be achieved by incorporating NBS education into antenatal education classes or through multimedia while women are waiting in the antenatal clinic. Healthcare providers may need education about the importance and benefits of providing women with information about NBS in the antenatal period.",

        "abstract": "The ongoing development of genomic medicine and the use of molecular and imaging markers in personalized medicine (PM) has arguably challenged the field of health economic modeling (HEM). This study aims to provide detailed insights into the current status of HEM in PM, in order to identify if and how modeling methods are used to address the challenges described in literature. Areas covered: A review was performed on studies that simulate health economic outcomes for personalized clinical pathways. Decision tree modeling and Markov modeling were the most observed methods. Not all identified challenges were frequently found, challenges regarding companion diagnostics, diagnostic performance, and evidence gaps were most often found. However, the extent to which challenges were addressed varied considerably between studies. Expert commentary: Challenges for HEM in PM are not yet routinely addressed which may indicate that either (1) their impact is less severe than expected, (2) they are hard to address and therefore not managed appropriately, or (3) HEM in PM is still in an early stage. As evidence on the impact of these challenges is still lacking, we believe that more concrete examples are needed to illustrate the identified challenges and to demonstrate methods to handle them.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: New Zealand is a developed geographically isolated country in the South Pacific with a population of 4.4 million. Genetic diagnosis is the standard of care for most patients with primary immunodeficiency disorders (PIDs).\nMETHODS: Since 2005, we have offered a comprehensive genetic testing service for PIDs and other immune-related disorders with a published sequence. Here we present results for this program, over the first decade, between 2005 and 2014.\nRESULTS: We undertook testing in 228 index cases and 32 carriers during this time. The three most common test requests were for X-linked lymphoproliferative (XLP), tumour necrosis factor receptor associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS) and haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). Of the 32 suspected XLP cases, positive diagnoses were established in only 2 patients. In contrast, genetic defects in 8 of 11 patients with suspected X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) were confirmed. Most XLA patients were initially identified from absence of B cells. Overall, positive diagnoses were made in about 23% of all tests requested. The diagnostic rate was lowest for several conditions with locus heterogeneity.\nCONCLUSIONS: Thorough clinical characterisation of patients can assist in prioritising which genes should be tested. The clinician-driven customised comprehensive genetic service has worked effectively for New Zealand. Next generation sequencing will play an increasing role in disorders with locus heterogeneity.",

Little information is currently available about physicians' attitudes towards these tests in developing countries.\nMETHODS: We conducted an email survey of Nepalese physicians practicing in academic and non-academic settings in Nepal, regarding knowledge, attitudes and perception towards genetic testing for gynaecologic cancer.\nRESULTS: Responses were received from 251 of 387 practitioners (65%). Only 46% of all respondents felt prepared to answer patients' questions about genetic testing for gynaecologic cancer, despite 80% reporting that patients had asked questions about genetic testing, and 55% being asked more than 5 times in the past year. 42% reported more than 10 of their patients having had genetic testing for cancer, the majority for BRCA1/2. Access (40%), cost (37%) and lack of physicians' information (24%) were cited as the main barriers to testing. The most commonly identified concerns regarding genetic testing were the potential for increased patient anxiety, misinterpretation of results by patients, and maintaining confidentiality of results (64%, 47% and 38% of respondents respectively).\nCONCLUSION: This study shows the gap among the health care providers in developing countries and the available modern scientific tools and skills in regard to the benefits of genetic testing for gynaecological cancers in a developing nation. These findings indicate the need for the introduction of further genetic counselling education and support into gynaecological care in Nepal.",

The emergence of novel targeted agents, that directly correct CFTR loss function alleles, has created new treatment opportunities for patients with cystic fibrosis with advanced disease. Knowledge of the role of these agents in the clinical setting is quickly evolving and will require physicians to stay acquainted with the latest data as well as evidence-based treatment guidelines in order to achieve optimized cystic fibrosis patient care. Ideally, after diagnosis, a personalized approach would be adapted and tailored to the patient through genome-informed medicine. However, due to the relative recentness of genomic-based therapeutics, physicians may have a limited knowledge base regarding these new treatment options and how to best incorporate these agents into patient management plans. Although cystic fibrosis is still largely regarded as a pediatric disease, the median survival for patients is 35years of age. Consequently, pediatric-to-adult cystic fibrosis care programs would allow suitable preparation time for this transition and develop a standardized group of self-care and management skills.",

Pharmacogenomics studies have shown that variants in CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genes are strongly and consistently associated with warfarin dose variability. Although different populations from the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region may share the same ancestry, it is still unclear how they compare in the genetic and non-genetic factors affecting their warfarin dosing.\nOBJECTIVE: To explore the prevalence of CYP2C9 and VKORC1 variants in MENA, and the effect of these variants along with other non-genetic factors in predicting warfarin dose.\nMETHODS: In this systematic review, we included observational cross sectional and cohort studies that enrolled patients on stable warfarin dose and had the genetics and non-genetics factors associated with mean warfarin dose as the primary outcome. We searched PubMed, Medline, Scopus, PharmGKB, PHGKB, Google scholar and reference lists of relevant reviews.\nRESULTS: We identified 17 studies in eight different populations: Iranian, Israeli, Egyptian, Lebanese, Omani, Kuwaiti, Sudanese and Turkish. Most common genetic variant in all populations was the VKORC1 (-1639G>A), with a minor allele frequency ranging from 30% in Egyptians and up to 52% and 56% in Lebanese and Iranian, respectively. Variants in the CYP2C9 were less common, with the highest MAF for CYP2C9*2 among Iranians (27%). Variants in the VKORC1 and CYP2C9 were the most significant predictors of warfarin dose in all populations. Along with other genetic and non-genetic factors, they explained up to 63% of the dose variability in Omani and Israeli patients.\nCONCLUSION: Variants of VKORC1 and CYP2C9 are the strongest predictors of warfarin dose variability among the different populations from MENA. Although many of those populations share the same ancestry and are similar in their warfarin dose predictors, a population specific dosing algorithm is needed for the prospective estimation of warfarin dose.",

On the basis of the results of professional surveys, literature review, and the Working Group's subject matter expert consensus, a four-tiered system to categorize somatic sequence variations based on their clinical significances is proposed: tier I, variants with strong clinical significance; tier II, variants with potential clinical significance; tier III, variants of unknown clinical significance; and tier IV, variants deemed benign or likely benign. Cancer genomics is a rapidly evolving field; therefore, the clinical significance of any variant in therapy, diagnosis, or prognosis should be reevaluated on an ongoing basis. Reporting of genomic variants should follow standard nomenclature, with testing method and limitations clearly described.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Identifying patients with obstructive coronary artery disease can be challenging for primary care physicians. Advances in precision medicine may help augment clinical tools and redefine the paradigm for evaluating coronary artery disease in the outpatient setting. A blood-based age/sex/gene expression score (ASGES) incorporating key features of precision medicine has shown clinical validity with a 96% negative predictive value and 89% sensitivity in estimating a symptomatic patient's current likelihood of obstructive coronary artery disease. To better characterize the clinical utility of the ASGES and measure its impact on clinician decision-making, a community-based registry was established.\nMETHODS: The prospective PRESET Registry (NCT01677156) enrolled stable, nonacute adult patients presenting with typical or atypical symptoms suggestive of obstructive coronary artery disease from 21 US primary care practices from August 2012 to August 2014. Demographics, clinical characteristics, and ASGES results (predefined as low [ASGES \u226415] or elevated [ASGES >15]) were collected, as were referrals to Cardiology or further functional/anatomic cardiac testing after ASGES testing. Patients were followed for 1 year post ASGES testing.\nRESULTS: Among the 566-patient cohort (median age 56 years), clinicians referred 26/252 (10%) of patients with low scores vs 137/314 (44%) of patients with elevated scores to Cardiology or advanced cardiac testing for further evaluation (unadjusted odds ratio 0.15, P <.0001; adjusted odds ratio after accounting for clinical covariates\u00a0= 0.18, P <.0001). Data on 84 patients referred for advanced cardiac testing showed abnormal findings in 0 of 13 (0%) low ASGES and 10 of 71 (14%) elevated ASGES patients. Major adverse cardiovascular events and revascularization were noted in 3/252 (1.2%) patients with low ASGES and 14/314 (4.5%) patients with elevated ASGES score (P <.03).\nCONCLUSIONS: In this community-based cardiovascular registry, the ASGES demonstrated clinical utility in the evaluation of patients with suspected obstructive coronary artery disease. Low-score patients were less likely to undergo cardiac referral, were unlikely to have positive findings on further cardiac work-up, and had a low rate of adverse cardiovascular events in 1-year follow-up.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Endometrial carcinoma (EC) is the most common extracolonic malignant neoplasm associated with Lynch syndrome (LS). LS is caused by autosomal dominant germline mutations in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes. Screening for LS in EC is often evaluated by loss of immunohistochemical (IHC) expression of DNA MMR enzymes MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 (MMR IHC). In July 2013, our clinicians asked that we screen all EC in patients \u226460 for loss of MMR IHC expression. Despite this policy, several cases were not screened or screening was delayed. We implemented an informatics-based approach to ensure that all women who met criteria would have timely screening.\nSUBJECTS AND METHODS: Reports are created in PowerPath (Sunquest Information Systems, Tucson, AZ) with custom synoptic templates. We implemented an algorithm on March 6, 2014 requiring pathologists to address MMR IHC in patients \u226460 with EC before sign out (S/O). Pathologists must answer these questions: is patient \u226460 (yes/no), if yes, follow-up questions (IHC done previously, ordered with addendum to follow, results included in report, N/A, or not ordered), if not ordered, one must explain. We analyzed cases from July 18, 2013 to August 31, 2016 preimplementation (PreImp) and postimplementation (PostImp) that met criteria. Data analysis was performed using the standard data package included with GraphPad Prism\u00ae 7.00 (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA).\nRESULTS: There were 147 patients who met criteria (29 PreImp and 118 PostImp). IHC was ordered in a more complete and timely fashion PostImp than PreImp. PreImp, 4/29 (13.8%) cases did not get any IHC, but PostImp, only 4/118 (3.39%) were missed (P = 0.0448). Of cases with IHC ordered, 60.0% (15/25) were ordered before or at S/O PreImp versus 91.2% (104/114) PostImp (P = 0.0004). Relative to day of S/O, the mean days of order delay were longer and more variable PreImp versus PostImp (12.9 \u00b1 40.7 vs. -0.660 \u00b1 1.15; P = 0.0227), with the average being before S/O PostImp.\nCONCLUSION: This algorithm ensures MMR IHC ordering in women \u226460 with EC and can be applied to similar scenarios. Ancillary tests for management are increasing, especially genetic and molecular-based methods. The burden of managing orders and results remains with the pathologist and relying on human intervention alone is ineffective. Ordering IHC before or at S/O prevents oversight and the additional work of retrospective ordering and reporting.",

Thus, the objective of this systematic review was to identify studies of US PCPs' knowledge, attitudes, and communication-related behaviors regarding genetic tests that could inform risk-stratification approaches for breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer screening in order to describe current findings and research gaps.\nMETHODS: We conducted a systematic search of six electronic databases to identify peer-reviewed empirical articles relating to US PCPs and genetic testing for breast, colorectal, or prostate cancer published in English from 2008 to 2016. We reviewed these data and used narrative synthesis methods to integrate findings into a descriptive summary and identify research needs.\nRESULTS: We identified 27 relevant articles. Most focused on genetic testing for breast cancer (23/27) and colorectal cancer risk (12/27); only one study examined testing for prostate cancer risk. Most articles addressed descriptive research questions (24/27). Many studies (24/27) documented PCPs' knowledge, often concluding that providers' knowledge was incomplete. Studies commonly (11/27) examined PCPs' attitudes. Across studies, PCPs expressed some concerns about ethical, legal, and social implications of testing. Attitudes about the utility of clinical genetic testing, including for targeted cancer screening, were generally favorable; PCPs were more skeptical of direct-to-consumer testing. Relatively fewer studies (9/27) examined PCPs' communication practices regarding cancer genetic testing.\nDISCUSSION: This review indicates a need for investigators to move beyond descriptive research questions related to PCPs' knowledge and attitudes about cancer genetic testing. Research is needed to address important gaps regarding the development, testing, and implementation of innovative interventions and educational programs that can improve PCPs' genetic testing knowledge, assuage concerns about the appropriateness of cancer genetic testing, and promote open and effective patient-provider communication about genetic risk and genetic testing.",

Two years later, the Malaysian Medical Council implemented the first and only regulation on the use of Pre-implantation Genetic Diagnosis in this country. The birth of Yau Tak triggered a public outcry because PGD was used for non-medical sex selection thus, raising concerns about PGD and its implications for the society. This study aims to explore participants' perceptions of the future implications of PGD for the Malaysian society. We conducted in-depth interviews with 21 participants over a period of one year, using a semi-structured questionnaire. Findings reveal that responses varied substantially among the participants; there was a broad acceptance as well as rejection of PGD. Contentious ethical, legal and social issues of PGD were raised during the discussions, including intolerance to and discrimination against people with genetic disabilities; societal pressure and the 'slippery slope' of PGD were raised during the discussions. This study also highlights participants' legal standpoint, and major issues regarding PGD in relation to the accuracy of diagnosis. At the social policy level, considerations are given to access as well as the impact of this technology on families, women and physicians. Given these different perceptions of the use of PGD, and its implications and conflicts, policies and regulations of the use of PGD have to be dealt with on a case-by-case basis while taking into consideration of the risk-benefit balance, since its application will impact the lives of so many people in the society.",

The prevailing response among commentators has been to restrict conditions eligible for testing based on medical severity, which imposes disputed value judgments and devalues those living with eligible conditions. To avoid these difficulties, we propose an unrestricted testing policy, under which prospective parents could obtain information on any variant of known significance after a careful informed consent process that uses an interactive decision aid to deliver a mandatory presentation on the purposes, techniques, and limitations of genomic testing, as well as optional resources for reflection and consultation.

Next generation sequencing (NGS) has begun to supplant other technologies for genomic profiling. Targeted NGS is a method that allows parallel sequencing of thousands of short DNA sequences in a single test offering a cost-effective approach for detecting multiple genetic alterations with a minimum amount of DNA. In the present review, we collected data concerning the clinical application of NGS technology in the setting of colorectal cancer.",

        "abstract": "Access policies of biobanks specify the governance of sample and data sharing. Basic guidance on relevant access criteria exists, but so far little is known about their public availability and what criteria for access and prioritization they actually include. Access policies were gathered by hand searching the websites of biobanks identified via registries (eg, BBMRI and P3G), and by additional search strategies. Criteria for access and prioritization were synthesized by thematic analysis. Of 523 biobank websites screened, 9% included a publicly available access policy. With all applied search strategies, we finally retrieved 74 access policies. Thematic analysis resulted in 62 different access criteria in three main categories: (a) scientific quality, (b) value and (c) ethical soundness. 'Scientific quality' criteria were mentioned in 70% of all policies, 'value' criteria in 33% and 'ethical soundness' criteria in 73%. Criteria for prioritization were specified in 27% of all policies. Access policies differed broadly in number, specification and operationalization of the included access criteria. In order to make biobank research more effective, efficient and trustworthy, access policies should be more available to the public. Furthermore, access policies should aim for precise and more harmonized wording of access criteria. From a public and governance perspective, the issue of how to prioritize access to scarce samples should form part of access policies.",

        "abstract": "DNA focused panel sequencing has been rapidly adopted to assess therapeutic targets in advanced/refractory cancer. Integrated Genomic Profiling (IGP) utilising DNA/RNA with tumour/normal comparisons in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) compliant setting enables a single assay to provide: therapeutic target prioritisation, novel target discovery/application and comprehensive germline assessment. A prospective study in 35 advanced/refractory cancer patients was conducted using CLIA-compliant IGP. Feasibility was assessed by estimating time to results (TTR), prioritising/assigning putative therapeutic targets, assessing drug access, ascertaining germline alterations, and assessing patient preferences/perspectives on data use/reporting. Therapeutic targets were identified using biointelligence/pathway analyses and interpreted by a Genomic Tumour Board. Seventy-five percent of cases harboured 1-3 therapeutically targetable mutations/case (median 79 mutations of potential functional significance/case). Median time to CLIA-validated results was 116 days with CLIA-validation of targets achieved in 21/22 patients. IGP directed treatment was instituted in 13 patients utilising on/off label FDA approved drugs (n\u2009=\u20099), clinical trials (n\u2009=\u20093) and single patient IND (n\u2009=\u20091). Preliminary clinical efficacy was noted in five patients (two partial response, three stable disease). Although barriers to broader application exist, including the need for wider availability of therapies, IGP in a CLIA-framework is feasible and valuable in selection/prioritisation of anti-cancer therapeutic targets.",

Public awareness of SCD and the need for premarital screening (PMS) are essential to reduce the incidence of this disease. This study aimed to assess awareness of and beliefs regarding SCD and PMS among Omanis in a primary healthcare setting.\nMETHODS: This cross-sectional study took place in five health centres located in Al-Seeb Province, Muscat, Oman, between June and August 2015. A total of 500 Omanis aged \u226518 years old attending the clinics were invited to participate in the study. A previously described questionnaire by Gustafson et al. was used to measure awareness of and beliefs regarding SCD and PMS.\nRESULTS: A total of 450 Omani adults completed the questionnaire (response rate: 90.0%). The majority (67.8%) were aware that SCD is genetically inherited and 85.1% believed in the value of PMS; however, only 24.4% reported having undergone PMS previously. Few participants were aware that SCD can be very painful (20.2%) and can cause strokes, infections and organ damage (20.0%). More than half (56.7%) reported that the availability of educational material on SCD or PMS in Oman was inadequate. Participants' education levels were positively associated with accurate SCD knowledge (P &lt;0.05).\nCONCLUSION: Despite the free availability of PMS services in local health centres, few Omanis reported having undergone PMS previously. Health promotion and education programmes are therefore needed in Oman in order to increase public awareness of SCD and the value of PMS.",

The clinical integration of genome sequencing into standard clinical practice has been limited and the potential utility of genome sequencing to identify clinically impactful information beyond targetable alterations has been underestimated.\nMETHODS: The Precision in Pediatric Sequencing (PIPseq) Program at Columbia University Medical Center instituted prospective clinical next generation sequencing (NGS) for pediatric cancer and hematologic disorders at risk for treatment failure. We performed cancer whole exome sequencing (WES) of patient-matched tumor-normal samples and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of tumor to identify sequence variants, fusion transcripts, relative gene expression, and copy number variation (CNV). A directed cancer gene panel assay was used when sample adequacy was a concern. Constitutional WES of patients and parents was performed when a constitutionally encoded disease was suspected. Results were initially reviewed by a molecular pathologist and subsequently by a multi-disciplinary molecular tumor board. Clinical reports were issued to the ordering physician and posted to the patient's electronic medical record.\nRESULTS: NGS was performed on tumor and/or normal tissue from 101 high-risk pediatric patients. Potentially actionable alterations were identified in 38% of patients, of which only 16% subsequently received matched therapy. In an additional 38% of patients, the genomic data provided clinically relevant information of diagnostic, prognostic, or pharmacogenomic significance. RNA-seq was clinically impactful in 37/65 patients (57%) providing diagnostic and/or prognostic information for 17 patients (26%) and identified therapeutic targets in 15 patients (23%). Known or likely pathogenic germline alterations were discovered in 18/90 patients (20%) with 14% having germline alternations in cancer predisposition genes. American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) secondary findings were identified in six patients.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate the feasibility of incorporating clinical NGS into pediatric hematology-oncology practice. Beyond the identification of actionable alterations, the ability to avoid ineffective/inappropriate therapies, make a definitive diagnosis, and identify pharmacogenomic modifiers is clinically impactful. Taking a more inclusive view of potential clinical utility, 66% of cases tested through our program had clinically impactful findings and samples interrogated with both WES and RNA-seq resulted in data that impacted clinical decisions in 75% of cases.",

However, to date large-scale genomic sequencing of cancer patients has been limited to Western populations. In order to understand possible ethnic and geographic differences and to explore the broader application of CGS to other populations, we sequenced a panel of 415 important cancer genes to characterize clinically actionable genomic driver events in 201 Japanese patients with colorectal cancer (CRC).\nMETHODS: Using next-generation sequencing methods, we examined all exons of 415 known cancer genes in Japanese CRC patients (n\u2009=\u2009201) and evaluated for concordance among independent data obtained from US patients with CRC (n\u2009=\u2009108) and from The Cancer Genome Atlas-CRC whole exome sequencing (WES) database (n\u2009=\u2009224). Mutation data from non-hypermutated Japanese CRC patients were extracted and clustered by gene mutation patterns. Two different sets of genes from the 415-gene panel were used for clustering: 61 genes with frequent alteration in CRC and 26 genes that are clinically actionable in CRC.\nRESULTS: The 415-gene panel is able to identify all of the critical mutations in tumor samples as well as WES, including identifying hypermutated tumors. Although the overall mutation spectrum of the Japanese patients is similar to that of the Western population, we found significant differences in the frequencies of mutations in ERBB2 and BRAF. We show that the 415-gene panel identifies a number of clinically actionable mutations in KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF that are not detected by hot-spot testing. We also discovered that 26% of cases have mutations in genes involved in DNA double-strand break repair pathway. Unsupervised clustering revealed that a panel of 26 genes can be used to classify the patients into eight different categories, each of which can optimally be treated with a particular combination therapy.\nCONCLUSIONS: Use of a panel of 415 genes can reliably identify all of the critical mutations in CRC patients and this information of CGS can be used to determine the most optimal treatment for patients of all ethnicities.",

Our aim was to assess the association between family history of diabetes and/or CVD and lifestyle behaviors and risk factors (smoking, low physical activity, excessive dietary sodium and cholesterol intake and obesity) in a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2009-2012. Family history, lifestyle behaviors and risk factors were defined using self-reported and physical examination data. The study sample included 10,988 participants with a mean age of 47years. Among the U.S. adult population, 29.5%, 5.7% and 6.5% had a family history of diabetes, CVD and both diseases respectively. Compared to participants with no family history, participants with a family history of diabetes, CVD and both diabetes and CVD were more likely to be current smokers (OR=1.18[95% CI, 1.03-1.35], OR=1.68[95% CI, 1.31-2.17] and OR=1.71[95% CI, 1.30-2.26] respectively).

We coded 79 audio recorded risk disclosure sessions with the Roter Interaction Analysis System. Multilevel analyses explored differences in communication when disclosed risks were based on age and MCI diagnosis alone or in addition to APOE genotype status.\nRESULTS: The addition of genotype results diminished the patient-centered nature of the sessions (p<0.001). When \u03b54 positive relative to \u03b54 negative results were disclosed, visit companions were more verbally active (p<0.05), disclosed more medical information (p<0.05), were more positive verbally and non-verbally (p<0.05) and were more proactive in setting the visit agenda (p<0.05).\nCONCLUSIONS: Delivery of complex genetic risk information reduces the patient-centeredness of disclosure sessions. Visit companions are more actively engaged in session communication when patients are at increased genetic risk for AD.\nPRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: AD risk discussions can be improved by supporting the positive role of visit companions and addressing the challenges inherent in the delivery of complex genetic information in a patient-centered manner.",

Yet while much emphasis is put on the technical challenges of translation, there is less scholarly attention for the social infrastructures through which novel medical interventions may be delivered to patient populations. Reflecting the idea that cancer is at the frontier of genomic applications in health care, this paper explores how the assessment of familial breast cancer risks was 'translated' into routine health care in Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. The paper identifies regulation, institutionalization and standardization as key mechanisms of translation that find distinct expression in particular sociocultural contexts and shape both the social and technical making of genomics into routine clinical practice. Translation is therefore an area of social as well as technical concern, and therefore requires collective decision-making.",

Biochemical markers of iron-overloading may be affected by other conditions.\nAIM: To measure the correlation between iron studies and HFE genotype to inform evidence-based recommendations for laboratory testing in New Zealand.\nMETHODS: Results from 2388 patients genotyped for C282Y, H63D and S65C in Wellington, New Zealand from 2007 to 2013 were compared with their biochemical phenotype as quantified by serum ferritin (SF), transferrin saturation (TS), serum iron (SI) and serum transferrin (ST). The predictive power of these markers was evaluated by receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, and if a statistically significant association for a variable was seen, sensitivity, specificity and predictive values were calculated.\nRESULTS: Test ordering patterns showed that 62% of HFE genotyping tests were ordered because of an elevated SF alone and only 11% of these had a C-reactive protein test to rule out an acute phase reaction. The association between SF and significant HFE genotypes SF was low. However, TS values \u226545% predicted HH mutations with the highest sensitivity and specificity.

To facilitate identification of mutations in a broad range of solid and hematological malignancies, a 467-gene oncology panel (Columbia Combined Cancer Panel) was developed in collaboration with pathologists and oncologists and is currently available and in use for clinical diagnostics. Herein, we share our experience with this testing in an academic medical center. Of 255 submitted specimens, which encompassed a diverse range of tumor types, we were able to successfully sequence 92%. The Columbia Combined Cancer Panel assay led to the detection of a targetable variant in 48.7% of cases. However, although we show good clinical performance and diagnostic yield, third-party reimbursement has been poor. Reimbursement from government and third-party payers using the 81455 Current Procedural Terminology code was at 19.4% of billed costs, and 55% of cases were rejected on first submission. Likely contributing factors to this low level of reimbursement are the delays in valuation of the 81455 Current Procedural Terminology code and in establishing national or local coverage determinations.

Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) constitute the current standard for assessment. With further advancements in genomic medicine, new clinically relevant biomarkers are rapidly emerging and options for targeted therapy are increasing in patients with advanced disease, driving the need for comprehensive molecular profiling. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is an attractive approach for up-front comprehensive assessment, including ERBB2 status, but the concordance with traditional methods of HER2 assessment is not well established. The Memorial Sloan Kettering-Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets (MSK-IMPACT) assay, a hybrid capture-based NGS assay interrogating the coding regions of 410 cancer-related genes, was performed on manually macrodissected unstained sections from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded breast (n\u00a0=\u00a0213) and gastroesophageal (n\u00a0=\u00a039) tumors submitted for clinical mutation profiling. ERBB2 status was assessed using a custom bioinformatics pipeline, and NGS results were compared to IHC and FISH. NGS ERBB2 amplification calls had an overall concordance of 98.4% (248/252) with the combined IHC/FISH results in this validation set. Discrepancies occurred in the context of low tumor content and HER2 heterogeneity. ERBB2 amplification status can be reliably determined by hybridization capture-based NGS methods, allowing efficient concurrent testing for other potentially actionable genomic alterations, particularly in limited material.",

Clinical and genomic data of all consecutive GI tumor samples from April, 2013 to April, 2016 sequenced by FoundationOne were obtained and analyzed. A total of 101 samples from 97 patients were analyzed. Ninety-eight samples from 95 patients could be amplified making this approach feasible in 97% of the samples. After removing duplicates, 95 samples from 95 patients were included in the further analysis. Median time from specimen collection to reporting was 11\u00a0days. Genomic alteration-guided treatment recommendations were considered new and clinically relevant in 38% (36/95) of the patients. Rapid decline in functional status was noted in 25% (9/36) of these patients who could therefore not receive genomic-guided therapy.

As a result, an equally important aspect of the human genome - its common nature - has been underappreciated and underrepresented in the ethics literature and policy dialogue surrounding genetics and genomics. This article will argue that, just as the personal nature of the genome has been used to reinforce individual rights and justify important privacy protections, so too the common nature of the genome can be employed to support protections of the genome at a population level and policies designed to promote the public's wellbeing. In order for public health officials to have the authority to develop genetics policies for the sake of the public good, the genome must have not only a common, but also a public, dimension. This article contends that DNA carries a public dimension through the use of two conceptual frameworks: the common heritage (CH) framework and the common resource (CR) framework. Both frameworks establish a public interest in the human genome, but the CH framework can be used to justify policies aimed at preserving and protecting the genome, while the CR framework can be employed to justify policies for utilizing the genome for the public benefit. A variety of possible policy implications are discussed, with special attention paid to the use of large-scale genomics databases for public health research.",

        "abstract": "Secondary or incidental results can be identified in genomic research that increasingly uses whole exome/genome sequencing. Understanding research participants' preferences for secondary results and what influences these decisions is important for patient education, counseling, and consent, and for the development of policies regarding return of secondary results. Two hundred nineteen research participants enrolled in genomic studies were surveyed regarding hypothetical preferences for specific types of secondary results, and these preferences were correlated with demographic information and psychosocial data. The majority of research participants (73%) indicated a preference to learn about all results offered, with no clear pattern regarding which results were not desired by the remaining participants. Participants who reported greater interest in genetic privacy were less likely to indicate a preference to learn all results, as were individuals who self-identified as Jewish. Although most research participants preferred to receive all secondary results offered, a significant subset preferred to exclude some results, suggesting that an all-or-none policy would not be ideal for all participants. The correlations between preferences to receive secondary results, religious identification, and privacy concerns demonstrate the need for culturally sensitive counseling and educational materials accessible to all education levels to allow participants to make the best choices for themselves.",

        "title": "Cost-Effectiveness of Different Population Screening Strategies for Hereditary Haemochromatosis in Australia.",
        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Amongst populations of northern European ancestry, HFE-associated haemochromatosis is a common genetic disorder characterised by iron overload. In the absence of treatment, excess iron is stored in parenchymal tissues, causing morbidity and mortality. Population screening programmes may increase early diagnosis and reduce associated disease. No contemporary health economic evaluation has been published for Australia. The objective of this study was to identify cost-effective screening strategies for haemochromatosis in the Australian setting.\nMETHODS: A Markov model using probabilistic decision analysis was developed comparing four adult screening strategies: the status quo (cascade and incidental screening), genotyping with blood and buccal samples and transferrin saturation followed by genotyping (TfS). Target populations were males (30 years) and females (45 years) of northern European ancestry. Cost-effectiveness was estimated from the government perspective over a lifetime horizon.\nRESULTS: All strategies for males were cost-effective compared to the status quo. The incremental costs (standard deviation) associated with genotyping (blood) were AUD7 (56), TfS AUD15 (45) and genotyping (buccal) AUD63 (56), producing ICERs of AUD1673, 4103 and 15,233/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained, respectively. For females, only the TfS strategy was cost-effective, producing an ICER of AUD10,195/QALY gained. Approximately 3% of C282Y homozygotes were estimated to be identified with the status quo approach, compared with 40% with the proposed screening strategies.\nCONCLUSION: This model estimated that genotyping and TfS strategies are likely to be more cost-effective screening strategies than the status quo.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Developmental disorders (DD), including autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disability (ID), are a common group of clinical manifestations caused by a variety of genetic abnormalities. Genetic testing, including chromosomal microarray (CMA), plays an important role in diagnosing these conditions, but CMA can be limited by incomplete coverage of genetic abnormalities and lack of guidance for conditions rarely seen by treating physicians.\nMETHODS: We conducted a longitudinal, randomized controlled trial investigating the impact of a higher resolution 2.8 million (MM) probe-CMA test on the quality of care delivered by practicing general pediatricians and specialists. To overcome the twin problems of finding an adequate sample size of multiple rare conditions and under/incorrect diagnoses, we used standardized simulated patients known as CPVs. Physicians, randomized into control and intervention groups, cared for the CPV pediatric patients with DD/ASD/ID. Care responses were scored against evidence-based criteria. In round one, participants could order diagnostic tests including existing CMA tests. In round two, intervention physicians could order the 2.8MM probe-CMA test. Outcome measures included overall quality of care and quality of the diagnosis and treatment plan.\nRESULTS: Physicians ordering CMA testing had 5.43% (p<0.001) higher overall quality scores than those who did not. Intervention physicians ordering the 2.8MM probe-CMA test had 7.20% (p<0.001) higher overall quality scores. Use of the 2.8MM probe-CMA test led to a 10.9% (p<0.001) improvement in the diagnosis and treatment score. Introduction of the 2.8MM probe-CMA test led to significant improvements in condition-specific interventions including an 8.3% (p = 0.04) improvement in evaluation and therapy for gross motor delays caused by Hunter syndrome, a 27.5% (p = 0.03) increase in early cognitive intervention for FOXG1-related disorder, and an 18.2% (p<0.001) improvement in referrals to child neurology for Dravet syndrome.\nCONCLUSION: Physician use of the 2.8MM probe-CMA test significantly improves overall quality as well as diagnosis and treatment quality for simulated cases of pediatric DD/ASD/ID patients, and delivers additional clinical utility over existing CMA tests.",

        "abstract": "Lynch syndrome is due to germline mutations in mismatch repair genes: MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2. It is characterized by an increased risk of various cancers including colorectal and endometrial cancers. Early diagnosis of these patients allows for appropriate surveillance and improves survival rates. Differentiating between patients who should undergo genetic testing and those for whom it is not necessary is difficult despite various established criteria (Amsterdam and Bethesda). Often, health professionals meet in multidisciplinary committees (MDC) to discuss patient cases regarding Lynch syndrome. In this study, we evaluated if the prediction model PREMM<sub>1,2,6</sub> could be used to enhance MDC decision-making and whether it should be included in our own routine practice and in those of other French teams. Using the prediction model in our cohort would have avoided 12% of the analyses recommended by our MDC. Furthermore, all patients with a mutation in one of the MMR genes would have been detected. In addition, according to the model, we should have provided 20% more genetic testing, which suggests that the decision-making criteria used by the professionals in our MDC, was too restrictive. These results suggest that PREMM<sub>1,2,6</sub> should be used in current practice to validate the decisions of the MDC before genetic testing is performed in complex cases. The model should be added as a major quality criterion for genetic testing, along with somatic tests, as previously reported in the literature.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Individuals with hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) have a high risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). The benefits of colonic surveillance in Lynch syndrome and Amsterdam-positive (familial CRC type X familial colorectal cancer type X (FCCTX)) families are clear; only the interval between colonoscopies is debated. The potential benefits for families not fulfilling the Amsterdam criteria are uncertain. The aim of this study was to compare the outcome of colonic surveillance in different hereditary subgroups and to evaluate the surveillance programmes.\nMETHODS: A prospective, observational study on the outcome of colonic surveillance in different hereditary subgroups based on 24\u2005years of surveillance data from the national Danish HNPCC register.\nRESULTS: We analysed 13\u2005444 surveillance sessions, including 8768 incidence sessions and 20 450\u2005years of follow-up. CRC was more incident in the Lynch subgroup (2.0%) than in any other subgroup (0.0-0.4%, p<0.0001), but the incidence of advanced adenoma did not differ between the Lynch (3.6%) and non-Lynch (2.3-3.9%, p=0.28) subgroups. Non-Lynch Amsterdam-positive and Amsterdam-negative families were similar in their CRC (0.1-0.4%, p=0.072), advanced adenoma (2.3-3.3%, p=0.32) and simple adenoma (8.4-9.9%, p=0.43) incidence. In moderate-risk families, no CRC and only one advanced adenoma was found.\nCONCLUSIONS: The risk of CRC in Lynch families is considerable, despite biannual surveillance. We suggest less frequent and more individualised surveillance in non-Lynch families. Individuals from families with a strong history of CRC could be offered 5-year surveillance colonoscopies (unless findings at the preceding surveillance session indicate shorter interval) and individuals from moderate-risk families could be handled with the population-based screening programme for CRC after an initial surveillance colonoscopy.",

We aimed to describe the knowledge attained by subjects with a family history of CRC.\nMETHODS: Consecutive patients attending the gastroenterology clinic for a CRC family history were invited to take part in a cross-sectional survey. Attitudes towards SDM, satisfaction with the information received, knowledge currently achieved, and relevant influencing factors were evaluated. Satisfaction and attitudes towards SDM were evaluated with Likert scale questions. Knowledge was surveyed with closed (80%) and open (20%) questions.\nRESULTS: Of the 160 patients, 42.7% were male and the median age was 51.8 years (interquartile range: 43.9-58.5). Most subjects favored SDM; only 12.8% (8.4-19.1%) favored passive attitudes. Satisfaction with the information received about what a colonoscopy is and why it is recommended was adequate in 83.1% (76.4-88.2%). Information about risks satisfied 62.9% (55-70.1%) and about alternatives to colonoscopy only 30.6% (23.8-38.3%). The benefits of screening were better known than its risks and alternatives. The CRC decrease associated with screening was known to 71.3% (63.7-77.8%), but only 38.5% (31.1-46.4%) knew that a reduced risk still exists. Just 21.2% (15.5-26.9%) could mention an alternative screening method to colonoscopy and only 42.5% (35-50.4%) were aware of any associated harm. On multivariate analysis, higher educational level and younger age of the attending physician were associated with higher knowledge scores.\nCONCLUSION: SDM is considered favorably by most patients.

Ubiquitous Pharmacogenomics (U-PGx) program is a coordinated effort that put together scientific and clinical expertise in the pharmacogenomic field, to implement the pre-emptive pharmacogenomic approach in the clinical practice in Europe, and to demonstrate its benefit in both patients' clinical outcome and quality of life, with an economic advantage for the healthcare system.

All the genetic data will be prospectively collected and fully embedded into the patient's clinical record. An electronic clinical decision support system will be developed to alert physicians and pharmacists when a drug is being prescribed or dispensed to a patient with a risky genotype. U-PGx will test and harmonize this approach in seven healthcare environments (The Netherlands, Spain, UK, Italy, Austria, Greece, Slovenia) to set the basis for a future European healthcare system where an 'effective treatment optimization will be accessible to every European citizen' (www.upgx.eu).",

We designed a decision model to compare costs and probabilities of identifying a deleterious mutation or variant of uncertain significance (VUS) using different genetic testing strategies.\nMETHODS: A decision model was developed to compare costs and outcomes of two testing strategies for women with EOC: multigene testing (MGT) versus single-gene testing for BRCA1/2. Outcomes were mean cost and number of deleterious mutations and VUSs identified. Model inputs were obtained from published genetic testing data in EOC. One-way sensitivity analyses and Monte Carlo probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed.\nRESULTS: No family history model: MGT cost $1,160 more on average than BRCA1/2 testing and identified an additional 3.8 deleterious mutations for every 100 women tested. For each additional deleterious mutation identified, MGT cost $30,812 and identified 5.4 additional VUSs. Family history model: MGT cost $654 more on average and identified an additional 7.0 deleterious mutations for every 100 women tested. For each additional deleterious mutation identified, MGT cost $9,909 and identified 2.6 additional VUSs.\nCONCLUSION: MGT was associated with a higher additional cost per deleterious mutation identified and a higher ratio of VUS burden to actionable information in women with no family history as compared with women with a family history. Family history should be considered when determining an initial genetic testing platform in women with EOC.",

Policies and guidelines for risk stratification-unlike those for population screening programs, which are currently well regulated-are still under development. Indeed, the development of guidelines for risk stratification reflects the translational aspects of perspective. Here, we describe the risk stratification process that was devised in the context of perspective, and we then explain the consensus-based method used to develop recommendations for breast cancer screening and prevention in a risk-stratification approach.

Of the responders, 98% were white and 55% were female; 57% had 4 years or more of post-secondary education and an average age of 58.9\u2009\u00b1\u20095.5 years. Twenty-six percent said that they only somewhat understood their results and 7% reported they did not understand them at all. Only education predicted understanding. The most common suggestion for improvement was the use of layperson's terms when reporting results. In addition, responders suggested that results should be personalized by referring to medications that they were currently using. Of those reporting imperfect drug adherence, most (91%) reported they would be more likely to use medication as prescribed if pharmacogenomic information was used to help select the drug or dose.\nCONCLUSION: Despite great efforts to simplify pharmacogenomic results (or because of them), approximately one-third of responders did not understand their results.

        "abstract": "Personalised medicine is a newly emerging field with much to offer to all populations in improved clinical treatment options. Since the 1970s, clinicians and researchers have all been working towards improving the health of Indigenous Australians. However, there has been little research on the impact of genetics on Indigenous health, how genetic and environmental factors interact to contribute to poor health in Indigenous people, and how genetic factors specific to Indigenous people affect their responses to particular treatments. This short review highlights the urgent need for more genetic studies specific to Indigenous people in order to provide more appropriate care and to improve health outcomes. This paper explores why genetic work with Indigenous communities has been limited, how personalised medicine could benefit Indigenous communities, and highlights a number of specific instances in which personalised medicine has been critical for improving morbidity and mortality in other high-risk groups. In order to take the next step in advancing the health of Indigenous peoples, targeted research into the genetic factors behind chronic diseases is critically needed. This research may allow clinicians a better understanding of how genetic factors interact with environmental factors to influence an Indigenous Australian's individual risk of disease, prognosis, and response to therapies.

Many gaps remain in the understanding of TSC because of the complexity in clinical presentation. The TuberOus SClerosis registry to increase disease Awareness (TOSCA) is an international disease registry designed to address knowledge gaps in the natural history and management of TSC. Here, we present the baseline data of TOSCA cohort.\nMETHODS: Patients of any age diagnosed with TSC, having a documented visit for TSC within the preceding 12\u00a0months, or newly diagnosed individuals were included. The registry includes a \"core\" section designed to record detailed background information on each patient including disease manifestations, interventions, and outcomes collected at baseline and updated annually. \"Subsections\" of the registry recorded additional data related to specific features of TSC.\nRESULTS: Baseline \"core\" data from 2093 patients enrolled from 170 sites across 31 countries were available at the cut-off date September 30, 2014. Median age of patients at enrollment was 13\u00a0years (range, 0-71) and at diagnosis of TSC was 1\u00a0year (range, 0-69). The occurrence rates of major manifestations of TSC included - cortical tubers (82.2%), subependymal nodules (78.2%), subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (24.4%), renal angiomyolipomas (47.2%), lymphangioleiomyomatosis (6.9%), cardiac rhabdomyomas (34.3%), facial angiofibromas (57.3%), forehead plaque (14.1%), \u2265 3 hypomelanotic macules (66.8%), and shagreen patches (27.4%). Epilepsy was reported in 1748 (83.5%) patients, of which 1372 were diagnosed at\u2009\u2264\u20092\u00a0years (78%). Intellectual disability was identified in 451 (54.9%) patients of those assessed. TSC-associated neuropsychiatric disorders (TAND) were diagnosed late, and not evaluated in 30-50% of patients.\nCONCLUSION: TOSCA is the largest clinical case series of TSC to date. It provided a detailed description of the disease trajectory with increased awareness of various TSC manifestations. The rates of different features of TSC reported here reflect the age range and referral patterns of clinics contributing patients to the cohort. Documentation of TAND and LAM was poor. A widespread adoption of the international TSC assessment and treatment guidelines, including use of the TAND Checklist, could improve surveillance.

        "abstract": "To determine the correlation between BRAF genotype and MLH1 promoter methylation in a screening program for Lynch syndrome (LS), a universal screening program for LS was established in two medical centers. Tumors with abnormal MLH1 staining were evaluated for both BRAF V600E genotype and MLH1 promoter methylation. Tumors positive for both were considered sporadic, and genetic testing was recommended for all others. A total 1011 colorectal cancer cases were screened for Lynch syndrome, and 148 (14.6%) exhibited absent MLH1 immunostaining. Both BRAF and MLH1 methylation testing were completed in 126 cases. Concordant results (both positive or both negative) were obtained in 86 (68.3%) and 16 (12.7%) cases, respectively, with 81% concordance overall. The positive and negative predictive values for a BRAF mutation in predicting MLH1 promoter methylation were 98.9% and 41%, respectively, and the negative predictive value fell to 15% in patients \u226570 years old. Using BRAF genotyping as a sole test to evaluate cases with absent MLH1 staining would have increased referral rates for genetic testing by 2.3-fold compared with MLH1 methylation testing alone (31% vs 13.5%, respectively, P<0.01). However, a hybrid approach that reserves MLH1 methylation testing for BRAF wild-type cases only would significantly decrease the number of methylation assays performed and reduce the referral rate for genetic testing to 12.7%. A BRAF mutation has an excellent positive predictive value but poor negative predictive value in predicting MLH1 promoter methylation. A hybrid use of these tests may reduce the number of low-risk patients referred to genetic counseling and facilitate wider implementation of Lynch syndrome screening programs.",

To identify individuals at high genetic risk of PCM, from 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2015, we offered genetic counselling and molecular analysis of the two high-penetrance FAMMM susceptibility genes, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A) and cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4), to 92 consecutive, unrelated patients with FAMMM. Age at diagnosis and number of PCMs were obtained from medical records; the number of PCMs and affected relatives were recorded for each family. The diagnostic work-up consisted of genetic counselling and cascade genetic testing in patients and further extension to relatives of those identified as mutation carriers. All exons and exon/intron boundaries of CDKN2A and CDK4 genes were screened by direct bidirectional sequencing. We identified CDKN2A mutations in 19 of the 92 unrelated patients (20.6%) and in 14 additional, clinically healthy relatives. Eleven of these latter subsequently underwent excision of dysplastic nevi, but none developed PCM during a median follow-up of 37.3 months. In three patients from unrelated families, the novel CDKN2A p.D84V (c.251A>T) mutation was observed, associated with PCM in each pedigree. Genetic screening of FAMMM patients and their relatives can contribute towards specific primary and secondary prevention programmes for individuals at high genetic risk of PCM.

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Advanced stage squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck carries an overall poor prognosis, and survivorship gains have remained relatively stagnant compared to other malignancies due to its complex tumor biology and lack of proven effective targeting agents.\nMETHODS: We present a case of an exceptional responder to molecular-targeted therapy for metastatic oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma using a chemotherapeutic agent FDA approved for breast cancer and targeting the HER2/Neu receptor in order to discuss the larger clinical implications.\nRESULTS: The National Cancer Institute (NCI) has recently instituted the Exceptional Responders Initiative in order to identify such patients with unexpected outcomes in order to expedite the development of additional targeted therapies. This case illustrates the opportunity for cure using targeted oncogene identification in a scenario of recurrent squamous cell carcinoma with lung metastasis typically considered fatal.\nCONCLUSIONS: Molecular tumor analysis is an infrequently utilized tool in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma; however, as understanding of biologic mechanisms improves, additional molecular targets will become available and expand treatment opportunities such as HER2/Neu targeting. The Exceptional Responders Initiative is a unique strategy with potential to expedite progress.",

        "abstract": "Non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) is an exciting technology with the potential to provide a variety of clinical benefits, including a reduction in miscarriages, via a decline in invasive testing. However, there is also concern that the economic and near-future clinical benefits of NIPT have been overstated and the potential limitations and harms underplayed. NIPT, therefore, presents an opportunity to explore the ways in which a range of social pressures and policies can influence the translation, implementation, and use of a health care innovation. NIPT is often framed as a potential first tier screen that should be offered to all pregnant women, despite concerns over\u00a0cost-effectiveness. Multiple forces have contributed to a problematic translational environment in Canada, creating pressure towards first tier implementation. Governments have contributed to\u00a0commercialization pressure by framing the publicly funded research sector as a potential engine of economic growth. Members of industry have an incentive to frame clinical value as beneficial to\u00a0the broadest possible cohort in order to maximize market size. Many studies of NIPT were directly funded and performed by private industry in laboratories lacking strong independent oversight. Physicians' fear of potential liability for failing to recommend NIPT\u00a0may further drive widespread uptake. Broad social endorsement, when combined with these translation pressures, could result in the \"routinization\" of NIPT, thereby adversely affecting women's reproductive autonomy. Policymakers should demand robust independent evidence of clinical and public health\u00a0utility relevant to their respective jurisdictions before making\u00a0decisions regarding public funding for NIPT.",

However, little is known about patients' attitudes toward incorporation of genetic risk information as a component of personal health information in EHRs. This study investigated whether disclosure of a genetic risk score (GRS) for coronary heart disease influences attitudes toward incorporation of personal health information including genetic risk in EHRs.\nMETHODS: Participants aged 45-65 years with intermediate 10-year coronary heart disease risk were randomized to receive a conventional risk score (CRS) alone or with a GRS from a genetic counselor, followed by shared decision making with a physician using the same standard presentation and information templates for all study participants. The CRS and GRS were then incorporated into the EHR and made accessible to both patients and physicians. Baseline and post-disclosure surveys were completed to assess whether attitudes differed by GRS disclosure. Data were collected from 2013 to 2015 and analyzed in 2015-2016.\nRESULTS: GRS and CRS participants reported similar positive attitudes toward incorporation of genetic risk information in the EHR. Compared with CRS participants, participants with high GRS were more concerned about the confidentiality of genetic risk information (OR=3.67, 95% CI=1.29, 12.32, p=0.01). Post-disclosure, frequency of patient portal access was associated with positive attitudes.\nCONCLUSIONS: Participants in this study of coronary heart disease risk disclosure overall had positive attitudes toward incorporation of genetic risk information in EHRs, although those who received genetic risk information had concerns about confidentiality.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: An accurate family health history is essential for individual risk assessment. This study uses a multiple-informant approach to examine whether family members have consistent perceptions of shared familial risk for four common chronic conditions (heart disease, Type 2 diabetes, high cholesterol, and hypertension) and whether accounting for inconsistency in family health history reports leads to more accurate risk assessment.\nMETHODS: In 2012-2013, individual and family health histories were collected from 127 adult informants of 45 families in the Greater Cincinnati Area. Pedigrees were linked within each family to assess inter-informant (in)consistency regarding common biological family member's health history. An adjusted risk assessment based on pooled pedigrees of multiple informants was evaluated to determine whether it could more accurately identify individuals affected by common chronic conditions, using self-reported disease diagnoses as a validation criterion. Analysis was completed in 2015-2016.\nRESULTS: Inter-informant consistency in family health history reports was 54% for heart disease, 61% for Type 2 diabetes, 43% for high cholesterol, and 41% for hypertension. Compared with the unadjusted risk assessment, the adjusted risk assessment correctly identified an additional 7%-13% of the individuals who had been diagnosed, with a \u22642% increase in cases that were predicted to be at risk but had not been diagnosed.\nCONCLUSIONS: Considerable inconsistency exists in individual knowledge of their family health history. Accounting for such inconsistency can, nevertheless, lead to a more accurate genetic risk assessment tool. A multiple-informant approach is potentially powerful when coupled with technology to support clinical decisions.",

        "abstract": "AIM: We are currently facing several attempts aimed at marketing genetic data for predicting multifactorial diseases, among which diabetes mellitus is one of the more prevalent. The present document primarily aims at providing to practicing physicians a summary of available data regarding the role of genetic information in predicting diabetes and its chronic complications.\nDATA SYNTHESIS: Firstly, general information about characteristics and performance of risk prediction tools will be presented in order to help clinicians to get acquainted with basic methodological information related to the subject at issue. Then, as far as type 1 diabetes is concerned, available data indicate that genetic information and counseling may be useful only in families with many affected individuals. However, since no disease prevention is possible, the utility of predicting this form of diabetes is at question. In the case of type 2 diabetes, available data really question the utility of adding genetic information on top of well performing, easy available and inexpensive non-genetic markers. Finally, the possibility of using the few available genetic data on diabetic complications for improving our ability to predict them will also be presented and discussed. For cardiovascular complication, the addition of genetic information to models based on clinical features does not translate in a substantial improvement in risk discrimination. For all other diabetic complications genetic information are currently very poor and cannot, therefore, be used for improving risk stratification.\nCONCLUSIONS: In all, nowadays the use of genetic testing for predicting diabetes and its chronic complications is definitively of little value in clinical practice.",

        "abstract": "Emerging scientific endeavors are creating big data repositories of data from millions of individuals. Sharing data in a privacy-respecting manner could lead to important discoveries, but high-profile demonstrations show that links between de-identified genomic data and named persons can sometimes be reestablished. Such re-identification attacks have focused on worst-case scenarios and spurred the adoption of data-sharing practices that unnecessarily impede research. To mitigate concerns, organizations have traditionally relied upon legal deterrents, like data use agreements, and are considering suppressing or adding noise to genomic variants. In this report, we use a game theoretic lens to develop more effective, quantifiable protections for genomic data sharing. This is a fundamentally different approach because it accounts for adversarial behavior and capabilities and tailors protections to anticipated recipients with reasonable resources, not adversaries with unlimited means. We demonstrate this approach via a new public resource with genomic summary data from over 8,000 individuals-the Sequence and Phenotype Integration Exchange (SPHINX)-and show that risks can be balanced against utility more effectively than with traditional approaches. We further show the generalizability of this framework by applying it to other genomic data collection and sharing endeavors. Recognizing that such models are dependent on a variety of parameters, we perform extensive sensitivity analyses to show that our findings are robust to their fluctuations.",

Mutation carriers are at increased risk of various malignancies, including ovarian cancer (OC). Relatively little is known about the pathological features and clinical behavior of LS associated OC.\nMETHODS: We analyzed the data of 1047 proven MMR mutated individuals from a prospectively maintained database at a large referral center for genomic medicine in the North West of England. Data were crosschecked with pathology reports, the National Cancer Registry and death certificates, where appropriate. Data from gynecological surveillance and risk reducing surgery were analyzed.\nRESULTS: We identified 53 cases of LSAOC in proven MMR mutated individuals. The cumulative risk of LSAOC was 20% at age 80 in those who retained their ovaries. LSAOC presented at an earlier age (average 51, range 24-70years) than sporadic OC. The predominant histological subtype was endometrioid adenocarcinoma (53%). Most cases presented early (85% at stage I/II vs. 15% at stage III/IV, p<0.001) and overall survival was excellent (80% 5-year survival), however, patients with advanced disease had a poor prognosis (40% 5-year survival). Most women were found to have LS after their OC diagnosis, however, two were detected at Stage 1c through gynecological surveillance and a further three were detected following surgery for screen-detected synchronous endometrial pathology.\nCONCLUSION: The predominance of early stage disease in LSAOC is linked to its good prognosis. We support risk-reducing surgery for women whose families are complete especially if undertaking hysterectomy for endometrial risk, and ovarian surveillance as part of gynecological screening for those who have not.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Pharmacogenomic testing has become scalable and available to the general public. Pharmacogenomics has shown promise for predicting antidepressant response and tolerability in the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). In theory, pharmacogenomics can improve clinical outcomes by guiding antidepressant selection and dosing. The current systematic review examines the extant literature to determine the impact of pharmacogenomic testing on clinical outcomes in MDD and assesses its cost-effectiveness.\nDATA SOURCES: The MEDLINE/PubMed and Google Scholar databases were systematically searched for relevant articles published prior to October 2015. Search terms included various combinations of the following: major depressive disorder (MDD), depression, mental illness, mood disorder, antidepressant, response, remission, outcome, pharmacogenetic, pharmacogenomics, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetic, genetic testing, genome wide association study (GWAS), CYP450, personalized medicine, cost-effectiveness, and pharmacoeconomics.\nSTUDY SELECTION: Of the 66 records identified from the initial search, relevant clinical studies, written in English, assessing the cost-effectiveness and/or efficacy of pharmacogenomic testing for MDD were included.\nDATA EXTRACTION: Each publication was critically examined for relevant data.\nRESULTS: Two nonrandomized, open-label, 8-week, prospective studies reported overall greater improvement in depressive symptom severity in the group of MDD subjects receiving psychiatric care guided by results of combinatorial pharmacogenomic testing (GeneSight) when compared to the unguided group. One industry-sponsored, randomized, double-blind, 10-week prospective study reported a trend for improved outcomes for the GeneSight-guided group; however, the trend did not reach statistical significance. Another industry-sponsored, randomized, double-blind, 12-week prospective study reported a 2.5-fold increase in remission rates in the CNSDose-guided group (P < .0001). One naturalistic, unblinded, industry-sponsored study showed clinical improvement when pharmacogenomics testing guided prescribing; however, this study lacked a control group. A single cost-effectiveness study concluded that single gene testing was not cost-effective. Conversely, a separate study reported that combinatorial pharmacogenomic testing is cost-effective.\nCONCLUSIONS: A limited number of studies have shown promise for the clinical utility of pharmacogenomic testing; however, cost-effectiveness of pharmacogenomics, as well as demonstration of improved health outcomes, is not yet supported with replicated evidence.",

Among disease risks, heart disease (68% very interested), breast cancer (67%), and Alzheimer disease (66%) were of greatest interest prior to testing. Interest in disease risks was associated with female gender and poorer self-reported health (p < 0.01). Many consumers (38%) did not consider the possibility of unwanted information before purchasing services; this group was more likely to be older, male, and less educated (p < 0.05).

Because some of the proposed associations have received little attention from oversight agencies and professional genetic associations, scientific developments are currently outpacing governance regimes for consumer genetic testing.\nMAIN TEXT: We highlight the recent and unremarked upon emergence of biomedical studies linking markers of genetic ancestry to disease risks, and show that this body of scientific research is becoming part of public discourse connecting ancestry and health. For instance, data on genome-wide ancestry informative markers are being used to assess health risks, and we document over 100 biomedical research articles that propose associations between mitochondrial DNA and Y chromosome markers of genetic ancestry and a wide variety of disease risks. Taking as an example an association between coronary heart disease and British men belonging to Y chromosome haplogroup I, we show how this science was translated into mainstream and online media, and how it circulates among consumers of genetic tests for ancestry. We find wide variations in how the science is interpreted, which suggests the potential for confusion or misunderstanding.\nCONCLUSION: We recommend that stakeholders involved in creating and using estimates of genetic ancestry reconsider their policies for communicating with each other and with the public about the health implications of ancestry information.",

Much about the epidemiology of VHL disease remained unknown until fairly recently in Japan, leading to calls for the establishment of a VHL disease epidemiological database in Japanese. To elucidate its epidemiology in Japan, the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare created the VHL Disease Study Group, which was put in charge of carrying out a nationwide epidemiological survey. The survey found close to 400 Japanese VHL disease patients throughout the country. Based on those results, the VHL Disease Study Group created the VHL Disease Treatment Guideline and also a severity classification. It is thought that the prognosis of VHL disease patients can be improved by performing genetic diagnosis and careful follow-up. Accordingly, the University of Tokyo Hospital put in place an in-hospital system for implementing genomic medicine for VHL disease based on genetic diagnosis. For that system, it was especially important to establish (I) accurate genetic diagnostic techniques, (II) genetic counseling capabilities for the patients and their families, and (III) a system of cooperation among multiple departments, including urology departments, and so on. Further elucidation of the epidemiology and the development of genomic medicine are needed to improve the treatment results of VHL disease in Japan.",

Demographic and physiological parameters, along with neuroimaging data will be collected chronologically. Clinical events, including neurological, medical, and surgical interventions will be recorded. Whole blood samples will be collected. Extra- and intra-cranial vascular tissue, and/or cerebrospinal fluid will also be collected from patients who undergo surgical revascularization. These biospecimens will be stored at the repositories and utilized for genome-wide association studies for identifying genetic variants, as well as tissue-specific proteomic, and/or molecular analyses. Ethics approval will be obtained at all facilities collecting biospecimens.

This study aimed to explore qualitatively how Lynch syndrome non-carriers and carriers translate genetic risk information and advice to decisions about risk managment behaviours in the Australian healthcare system.\nMETHODS: Participants of the Australasian Colorectal Cancer Family Registry who had undergone predictive genetic testing for Lynch syndrome were interviewed on their risk management behaviours. Transcripts were analysed thematically using a comparative coding analysis.\nRESULTS: Thirty-three people were interviewed. Of the non-carriers (n\u2009=\u200916), 2 reported having apparently unnecessary colonoscopies, and 6 were unsure about what population-based colorectal cancer screening entails. Of the carriers (n\u2009=\u200917), 2 reported they had not had regular colonoscopies, and spoke about their discomfort with the screening process and a lack of faith in the procedure's ability to reduce their risk of developing colorectal cancer. Of the female carriers (n\u2009=\u20099), 2 could not recall being informed about the associated risk of gynaecological cancers.\nCONCLUSION: Non-carriers and female carriers of Lynch syndrome could benefit from further clarity and advice about appropriate risk management options. For those carriers who did not adhere to colonoscopy screening, a lack of faith in both genetic test results and screening were evident. It is essential that consistent advice is offered to both carriers and non-carriers of Lynch syndrome.",

        "abstract": "Conventional cytogenetics can categorize patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) into favorable, intermediate, and unfavorable-risk groups; however, patients with intermediate-risk cytogenetics represent the major population with variable outcomes. Because molecular profiling can assist with AML prognosis and next-generation sequencing allows simultaneous sequencing of many target genes, we analyzed 260 genes in 112 patients with de novo AML who received standard treatment. Multivariate analysis showed that karyotypes and mutation status of TET2, PHF6, KIT, and NPM1mutation /FLT3- internal tandem duplication (ITD)negative were independent prognostic factors for the entire cohort. Among patients with intermediate-risk cytogenetics, patients with mutations in CEBPAdouble mutation , IDH2, and NPM1 in the absence of FLT3-ITD were associated with improved Overall survival (OS), similar to those with favorable-risk cytogenetics; patients with mutations in TET2, RUNX1, ASXL1, and DNMT3A were associated with reduced OS, similar to those with unfavorable-risk cytogenetics. We concluded that integration of cytogenetic and molecular profiling improves prognostic stratification of patients into three groups with more distinct prognoses (P\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.001) and significantly reduces the number of patients classified as intermediate risk. In addition, our study demonstrates that next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based multi-gene sequencing is clinically applicable in establishing an accurate risk stratification system for guiding therapeutic decisions.",

Therefore, the aim of this prospective multicenter study was to investigate the specific diagnostic impact of mutation testing using a seven-gene panel in a routine primary referral setting analyzing FNAs from endocrinology and nuclear medicine practices in Germany.\nMETHODS: RNA and DNA was extracted from 564 routine air-dried FNA smears obtained from 64 physicians and cytologically graded by one experienced cytopathologist. PAX8/PPARG and RET/PTC rearrangements were detected by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, while BRAF and RAS mutations were detected by pyrosequencing. Molecular data were compared to histology and follow-up >1 year, which were available for 322/348 patients undergoing surgery and 33/74 patients having follow-up. Histology results were obtained from the local routine pathologists who were blinded to the molecular test results.\nRESULTS: BRAF and RET/PTC mutations were associated with carcinoma in 98% and 100% of samples, respectively. RAS and PAX8/PPARG mutations were associated with carcinoma in 31% and 0% of samples, respectively. Thirty-six percent of the carcinomas were identified by molecular testing in the atypia of undetermined significance/follicular lesion of undetermined significance and follicular neoplasm/suspicious for a follicular neoplasm categories, with malignancy rates of 15% and 17%, respectively. Due to a low percentage of RAS mutation-positive carcinomas in combination with a rather high percentage of RAS mutation-positive benign nodules, the positive predictive values of 41% and 36% in the atypia of undetermined significance/follicular lesion of undetermined significance and follicular neoplasm/suspicious for a follicular neoplasm categories offer only limited diagnostic potential.\nCONCLUSION: In conclusion, the data suggest that the application of the current seven-gene panel in a routine primary referral setting does not improve the presurgical diagnosis of thyroid FNAs. While the diagnostic relevance of RAS mutations in thyroid tumors needs further investigation, more comprehensive mutation panels with more cancer-specific mutations may improve the presurgical diagnosis of thyroid FNAs.",

The aim of this study was to determine the proportion of women who attended genetics counseling for consideration of BRCA1/2 gene analysis. We also sought to examine if regional differences in consultation rate exist across administrative health regions in the province of Ontario.\nMETHODS: We identified all women with a pathological diagnosis of HGSC in the province of Ontario between 1997 until 2011. Our primary outcome was the 2-year rate of genetics consultation following a diagnosis of HGSC. We compared consultation rates over time and geographical regions and applied multiple logistic regression to identify predictors of genetics consultation.\nRESULTS: Of the 5412 women with a diagnosis of HGSC over the study period, 6.6% were seen for genetics consultation within 2 years of diagnosis. Factors predictive of genetics consultation included history of breast cancer (odds ratio [OR], 3.56; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.87-6.78), era of diagnosis (2009-2011 vs 1997-2000; OR, 10.59; 95% CI, 5.02-22.33), and younger age at diagnosis (OR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.94-0.97 for each additional year).

Of the 3,817 medication orders associated with somatic pharmacogenomic testing information in their drug labels, 20% (372/1,819) of required tests were detected. The low rates of detectable pharmacogenomic testing suggest that structured testing programs are required to achieve the success of precision medicine.",

        "abstract": "Advancing precision medicine relies in part on examining populations that may exhibit unique genetic variants that impact clinical outcomes. Failure to include diverse populations in genomic-based research represents a health disparity. We implemented a community-based participatory research (CBPR) process with the Hmong community in Minnesota, who were refugees from Laos, in order to assess the feasibility of conducting genomic and pharmacogenomic-based research for genetic variants that are relevant to the Hmong community. Our Hmong Genomics Board, consisting of Hmong and non-Hmong professionals, used CBPR principles and built on previous formative research to create and implement culturally and linguistically appropriate informed consent processes for Hmong people at six community venues. The Board chose genetic variants for diabetes risk and warfarin response as relevant to the community. The Institutional Review Board approved aggregate but not individual return of results. Two hundred thirty-seven Hmong participants with mean (range) age of 30.2 (18-81) years and diverse levels of education (22% without and 75% with high-school education) provided saliva for genetic (DNA) analyses. Eighty-five percent of participants agreed to store DNA for future analyses, 82% agreed to share DNA with other researchers, and 78% agreed to be contacted for future studies. Twenty-five elders refused to participate because they wanted individual results. Aggregate results were shared with all participants. This CBPR approach proved highly successful to obtain informed consent and recruit a sample from the Hmong community for a genomic and pharmacogenomic study. Investment in the CBPR process may prove successful to address the gap of genomic information in under-represented communities.",

        "abstract": "CONTEXT: ERBB2 (erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2 or HER2) is currently the only biomarker established for selection of a specific therapy for patients with advanced gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma (GEA). However, there are no comprehensive guidelines for the assessment of HER2 in patients with GEA.\nOBJECTIVES: To establish an evidence-based guideline for HER2 testing in patients with GEA, to formalize the algorithms for methods to improve the accuracy of HER2 testing while addressing which patients and tumor specimens are appropriate, and to provide guidance on clinical decision making.\nDESIGN: The College of American Pathologists, American Society for Clinical Pathology, and American Society of Clinical Oncology convened an expert panel to conduct a systematic review of the literature to develop an evidence-based guideline with recommendations for optimal HER2 testing in patients with GEA.\nRESULTS: The panel is proposing 11 recommendations with strong agreement from the open-comment participants.\nRECOMMENDATIONS: The panel recommends that tumor specimen(s) from all patients with advanced GEA, who are candidates for HER2-targeted therapy, should be assessed for HER2 status before the initiation of HER2-targeted therapy. Clinicians should offer combination chemotherapy and a HER2-targeted agent as initial therapy for all patients with HER2-positive advanced GEA. For pathologists, guidance is provided for morphologic selection of neoplastic tissue, testing algorithms, scoring methods, interpretation and reporting of results, and laboratory quality assurance.\nCONCLUSIONS: This guideline provides specific recommendations for assessment of HER2 in patients with advanced GEA while addressing pertinent technical issues and clinical implications of the results.",

We selected original research articles based on specific inclusion criteria and then abstracted information about study design, genomic medicine, and implementation outcomes. Data were aggregated, and trends and gaps in the literature were discussed.\nRESULTS: Our final review encompassed 283 articles published in 2014, the majority of which described uptake (35.7%, n = 101) and preferences (36.4%, n = 103) regarding genomic technologies, particularly oncology (35%, n = 99). Key study design elements, such as racial/ethnic composition of study populations, were underreported in studies. Few studies incorporated implementation science theoretical frameworks, sustainability measures, or capacity building.\nCONCLUSION: Although genomic discovery provides the potential for population health benefit, the current knowledge base around implementation to turn this promise into a reality is severely limited.

One of the major challenges hindering its broader application is the time it takes to assess the clinical relevance of detected variants and the genes they impact so that disease risk is reported appropriately.\nMETHODS: To facilitate rapid interpretation of GS results in newborns, we curated a catalog of genes with putative pediatric relevance for their validity based on the ClinGen clinical validity classification framework criteria, age of onset, penetrance, and mode of inheritance through systematic evaluation of published evidence. Based on these attributes, we classified genes to guide the return of results in the BabySeq Project, a randomized, controlled trial exploring the use of newborn GS (nGS), and used our curated list for the first 15 newborns sequenced in this project.\nRESULTS: Here, we present our curated list for 1,514 gene-disease associations. Overall, 954 genes met our criteria for return in nGS. This reference list eliminated manual assessment for 41% of rare variants identified in 15 newborns.\nCONCLUSION: Our list provides a resource that can assist in guiding the interpretive scope of clinical GS for newborns and potentially other populations.Genet Med advance online publication 12 January 2017.",

Serum was collected for reflexive testing of cfDNA failures. Providers and patients were surveyed concerning knowledge, decision making, and satisfaction. Pregnancy outcome was determined by active or passive ascertainment.\nRESULTS: Between September 2014 and July 2015, 72 providers screened 2,691 women. The five largest participating practices increased uptake by 8 to 40%. Among 2,681 reports, 16 women (0.6%) were screen-positive for trisomy 21, 18, or 13; all saw genetic professionals. Twelve were confirmed (positive predictive value (PPV), 75%; 95% CI, 48-93%) and four were false-positives (0.15%). Of 150 failures (5.6%), 79% had a negative serum or subsequent cfDNA test; no aneuploidies were identified. Of 100 women surveyed, 99 understood that testing was optional, 96 had their questions answered, and 95 received sufficient information. Pretest information was provided by the physician/certified nurse midwife (55) or office nurse/educator (40); none was provided by genetic professionals.\nCONCLUSION: This first clinical utility study of cfDNA screening found higher uptake rates, patient understanding of basic concepts, and easy incorporation into routine obstetrical practices.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The success of the clinical use of sequencing based tests (from single gene to genomes) depends on the accuracy and consistency of variant interpretation. Aiming to improve the interpretation process through practice guidelines, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) and the Association for Molecular Pathology (AMP) have published standards and guidelines for the interpretation of sequence variants. However, manual application of the guidelines is tedious and prone to human error. Web-based tools and software systems may not only address this problem but also document reasoning and supporting evidence, thus enabling transparency of evidence-based reasoning and resolution of discordant interpretations.\nRESULTS: In this report, we describe the design, implementation, and initial testing of the Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen) Pathogenicity Calculator, a configurable system and web service for the assessment of pathogenicity of Mendelian germline sequence variants. The system allows users to enter the applicable ACMG/AMP-style evidence tags for a specific allele with links to supporting data for each tag and generate guideline-based pathogenicity assessment for the allele. Through automation and comprehensive documentation of evidence codes, the system facilitates more accurate application of the ACMG/AMP guidelines, improves standardization in variant classification, and facilitates collaborative resolution of discordances. The rules of reasoning are configurable with gene-specific or disease-specific guideline variations (e.g. cardiomyopathy-specific frequency thresholds and functional assays). The software is modular, equipped with robust application program interfaces (APIs), and available under a free open source license and as a cloud-hosted web service, thus facilitating both stand-alone use and integration with existing variant curation and interpretation systems. The Pathogenicity Calculator is accessible at http://calculator.clinicalgenome.org .\nCONCLUSIONS: By enabling evidence-based reasoning about the pathogenicity of genetic variants and by documenting supporting evidence, the Calculator contributes toward the creation of a knowledge commons and more accurate interpretation of sequence variants in research and clinical care.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Administrative records from insurance and hospital discharge data sources are important public health tools to conduct passive surveillance of disease in populations. Identifying rare but catastrophic conditions is a challenge since approaches for maximizing valid case detection are not firmly established.\nOBJECTIVE: The purpose of our study was to explore a number of algorithms in which International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes and other administrative variables could be used to identify cases of muscular dystrophy (MD).\nMETHODS: We used active surveillance to identify possible cases of MD in medical practices in neurology, genetics, and orthopedics in 5 urban South Carolina counties and to identify the cases that had diagnostic support (ie, true cases). We then developed an algorithm to identify cases based on a combination of ICD-9-CM codes and administrative variables from a public (Medicaid) and private insurer claims-based system and a statewide hospital discharge dataset (passive surveillance). Cases of all types of MD and those with Duchenne or Becker MD (DBMD) that were common to both surveillance systems were examined to identify the most specific administrative variables for ascertainment of true cases.\nRESULTS: Passive statewide surveillance identified 3235 possible cases with MD in the state, and active surveillance identified 2057 possible cases in 5 actively surveilled counties that included 2 large metropolitan areas where many people seek medical care. There were 537 common cases found in both the active and passive systems, and 260 (48.4%) were confirmed by active surveillance to be true cases. Of the 260 confirmed cases, 70 (26.9%) were recorded as DBMD.\nCONCLUSIONS: Accuracy of finding a true case in a passive surveillance system was improved substantially when specific diagnosis codes, number of times a code was used, age of the patient, and specialty provider variables were used.",

The goal of our study is to gain insight into determinants of Turkish and Moroccan patients' participation in breast cancer genetic counseling and DNA testing, from the point of view of healthcare professionals and patients. Questionnaire-based telephone interviews about awareness, perceptions, and reasons for (non-) participation in cancer genetic counseling were conducted with 78 Dutch breast cancer patients from Turkish and Moroccan descent. The interviews were held in Arabic, Berber, Turkish, or Dutch by bilingual research assistants. Additionally, 14 breast cancer patients participated in one of two focus group meetings, and two focus groups were held with 11 healthcare professionals. SPSS and QSR Nvivo were used to examine the quantitative and qualitative data, respectively. Half of the total group of patients (N\u00a0=\u00a078) and 79% of patients eligible for genetic counseling and testing (N\u00a0=\u00a033) were aware of the possibility of genetic counseling. The most important determinants for nonparticipation in genetic counseling were experienced difficulties in patient-doctor communication, cultural factors (e.g., social norms), limited health literacy, limited knowledge of the family cancer history, and anxiety about cancer. Religious beliefs and knowing personal and family members' breast cancer risks were motives to obtain genetic counseling. Despite the fact that our study showed that Moroccan and Turkish women reported several personal motives to obtain genetic counseling and testing (GCT), patients and healthcare professionals experience significant language and health literacy difficulties, which make it harder to fully access health care such as genetic counseling and testing.",

We hypothesized such a restriction would reduce access and appropriate testing.\nMETHODS: Test cancellation rates (ie, tests ordered that did not result in a reported test result), mutation-positive rates, and turnaround times for comprehensive BRCA1/2 testing for a study LNHP that implemented a GC-mandate policy were determined over the 12 months before and after policy implementation (excluding a 4-month transition period). Cancellation rates were evaluated based on the reason for cancellation, National Comprehensive Cancer Network testing criteria, and self-identified ancestry. A control LNHP was evaluated over the same period for comparison.\nRESULTS: The study LNHP cancellation rate increased from 13.3% to 42.1% ( P < .001) after policy implementation. This increase was also observed when only individuals who met National Comprehensive Cancer Network criteria for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer testing were considered (9.5% to 37.7%; P < .001). Cancellation rates increased after policy introduction for all ancestries; however, this was more pronounced among individuals of African or Latin American ancestry, for whom cancellation rates rose to 48.9% and 49.6%, respectively, compared with 33.9% for individuals of European ancestry. Over this same time period, control LNHP cancellation rates decreased or stayed the same for all subgroups.\nCONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate that a GC-mandate policy implemented by a LNHP substantially decreased access to appropriate genetic testing, disproportionately impacting minority populations without any evidence that inappropriate testing was decreased.",

Nuances of the immediate peri-event history, when available, can be paramount. New genetic tools have greatly improved the yield of such investigations, but they must be carefully interpreted by genetic specialists. The approach to surviving patients, their family members, and to family members of non-survivors is best achieved in a structured programme that includes all appropriate specialists and support personnel. As an example, this may include all appropriate paediatric and internal medicine specialists, a geneticist, a genetic counsellor, a clinical psychologist, nurse specialist(s), and a programme coordinator.

        "abstract": "The molecular millennium has bestowed clinicians and researchers with the essential tools to identify the underlying genetic substrates for thousands of genetic disorders, most of which are rare and follow Mendelian inheritance patterns. The genetic basis of potentially lethal and heritable cardiomyopathies and cardiac channelopathies has been identified and are now better understood. Genetic testing for several of these heritable conditions has made its transition from discovery through translation and have been commercially available clinical tests for over a decade. Now that clinical genetic testing is available more readily and delivers a disease-specific impact across the triad of medicine - diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic - it is important for the community of cardiologists to not only be familiar with the language of genomic medicine but to also be wiser users and even wiser interpreters of genetic testing so that wise decisions can be rendered for those patients and their families being evaluated with respect to the presence or absence of one of these potentially lethal yet highly treatable genetic disorders. The purpose of this review is to provide the reader with a foundational understanding of genetic testing in clinical cardiology. Here, we will present some benefits of genetic testing: indications for either post-mortem genetic testing for the major cardiomyopathies and channelopathies or pre-mortem genetic testing among the decedent's surviving relatives; the need for careful interpretation of genetic testing results; the importance of genetic counselling; and some points on the ethical and societal implications of genetic testing.",

This is especially true for genetically heterogeneous cancers, such as breast cancer (BC), in which PVs in different genes may be associated with various risks and cancer subtypes. The authors evaluated the outcomes of genetic testing among women who had a personal history of BC.\nMETHODS: A total of 35,409 women with a single diagnosis of BC who underwent clinical genetic testing with a 25-gene panel were included in the current analysis. Women with multiple BCs and men with BC were excluded. The frequency and distribution of PVs were assessed for the overall cohort, among women with triple-negative BC (TNBC) (n\u2009=\u20094797), and by age at diagnosis.\nRESULTS: PVs were identified in 9.3% of women tested; 51.5% of PVs were identified in genes other than breast cancer 1 (BRCA1) and BRCA2, including checkpoint kinase 2 (CHEK2) (11.7%), ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM; ATM serine/threonine kinase) (9.7%), and partner and localizer of BRCA2 (PALB2) (9.3%). The prevalence of PVs in BRCA1, PALB2, BRCA1-associated RING domain 1 (BARD1), BRCA1-interacting protein C-terminal helicase 1 (BRIP1), and RAD51 paralog C (RAD51C) was statistically higher among women with TNBC. The PV rate was higher among women aged <40 years, lower among women aged >59 years, and relatively constant (8.5%-9.0%) among women who were diagnosed between ages 40 and 59 years.\nCONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that panel testing increased the number of women identified as carrying a PV in this cohort compared with BRCA testing alone. Furthermore, the proportion of women identified who carried a PV in this cohort did not decrease between ages 40 and 59 years. Cancer 2017;123:1721-1730. \u00a9 2017 American Cancer Society.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Following predictive testing for Huntington disease (HD), knowledge of one's carrier status may have consequences on disease onset. Our study aimed to address two questions. First, does knowledge of being a carrier of the pathological HD mutation trigger onset of the disease? Second, does this knowledge influence self-awareness and allow carriers to identify signs and symptoms of disease onset?\nMETHODS: Between 2012 and 2015, 75 HD mutation carriers were examined using the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) motor score. Onset estimation made with the disease burden score was compared with UHDRS findings. We collected qualitative data with questionnaires and semistructured interviews.\nRESULTS: 38 women and 37 men, aged 43.7\u2005years\u00b110.5 (20-68), were interviewed after a mean delay between test and study interview of 10.5\u2005years\u00b14.7 (from 4 to 21\u2005years). Estimation of age at onset was 4.5\u00b18.5\u2005years earlier than data-derived age at onset. Participants were categorised according to their motor score: scores <5 were premanifest (n=35), and scores >5 were manifest carriers (n=40). Self-observation was a major preoccupation for all, independent of their clinical status (82% vs 74%, p=0.57). Among manifest carriers, 56% thought they showed symptoms, but only 33% felt ill. Interestingly, this was also observed in those without motor signs (20% and 9%). Being a mutation carrier did not significantly facilitate recognition of motor signs. Interviews with premanifest carriers allowed the burden of self-observation to be illustrated despite lack of motor signs.\nCONCLUSIONS: Estimating age at onset based on disease burden score may not be accurate. The transition to disease was experienced as an ambiguous or liminal experience. The view of mutation carriers is not always concordant with medical onset estimation, highlighting the difficulties involved in the concept of onset and its use as an outcome in future disease-modifying trials.",

Estimates of prostate cancer progression from the Decipher genomic classifier (GC) could guide informed decision-making and improve the outcomes for patients.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed a Markov model to compare the costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) associated with GC-based treatment decisions regarding adjuvant therapy after prostatectomy with those of 2 control strategies: usual care (determined from patterns of care studies) and the alternative of 100% adjuvant radiation therapy. Using the bootstrapping method of sampling with replacement, the cases of 10,000 patients were simulated during a 10-year time horizon, with each subject having individual estimates for cancer progression (according to GC findings) and noncancer mortality (according to age).\nRESULTS: GC-based care was more effective and less costly than 100% adjuvant radiation therapy and resulted in cost savings up to an assay cost of $11,402. Compared with usual care, GC-based care resulted in more QALYs. Assuming a $4000 assay cost, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $90,833 per QALY, assuming a 7% usage rate of adjuvant radiation therapy. GC-based care was also associated with a 16% reduction in the percentage of patients with distant metastasis at 5 years compared with usual care.\nCONCLUSION: The Decipher GC could be a cost-effective approach for genomics-driven cancer treatment decisions after prostatectomy, with improvements in estimated clinical outcomes compared with usual care. The individualized decision analytic framework applied in the present study offers a flexible approach to estimate the potential utility of genomic assays for personalized cancer medicine.",

Comparison of long-term survival probabilities under different treatments enables therapeutic decision support, which is available in exploratory form online. Personally tailored management decisions could reduce the number of hematopoietic cell transplants in patients with AML by 20-25% while maintaining overall survival rates.

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of Family History in the Electronic Health Record and to identify opportunities to advance the contributions of nurses in obtaining, updating and assessing family history in order to improve the health of all individuals and populations.\nORGANIZING CONSTRUCT: The article presents an overview of the obstacles to charting Family History within the Electronic Health Record and recommendations for using specific Family History tools and core Family History data sets.\nMETHODS: Opportunities to advance nursing contributions in obtaining, updating, and assessing family history in order to improve the health of all individuals were identified. These opportunities are focused within the area of promoting the importance of communication within families and between healthcare providers to obtain, document, and update family histories.\nFINDINGS: Nurses can increase awareness of existing resources that can guide collection of a comprehensive and accurate family history and facilitate family discussions. In this paper, opportunities to advance nursing contributions in obtaining, updating, and assessing family history in order to improve the health of all individuals were identified.\nCONCLUSIONS: Aligned with the clinical preparation of nurses, family health should be used routinely by nurses for risk assessment and to help inform patient and family members on screening, health promotion, and disease prevention. The quality of family health information is critical in order to leverage the use of genomic healthcare information and derive new knowledge about disease biology, treatment efficacy, and drug safety. These actionable steps need to be performed in the context of promoting evidence-based applications of family history that will be essential for implementing personalized genomic healthcare approaches and disease prevention efforts.\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE: Family health history is one of the most important tools for identifying the risk of developing rare and chronic conditions, including cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes, and represents an integration of disease risk from genetic, environmental, and behavioral/lifestyle factors. In fact, family history has long been recognized as a strong independent risk factor for disease and is the current best practice used in clinical practice to guide risk assessment.",

        "abstract": "Background: The utility of incorporating detailed family history into breast cancer risk prediction hinges on its independent contribution to breast cancer risk. We evaluated associations between detailed family history and breast cancer risk while accounting for breast density.Methods: We followed 222,019 participants ages 35 to 74 in the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium, of whom 2,456 developed invasive breast cancer. We calculated standardized breast cancer risks within joint strata of breast density and simple (1st-degree female relative) or detailed (first-degree, second-degree, or first- and second-degree female relative) breast cancer family history. We fit log-binomial models to estimate age-specific breast cancer associations for simple and detailed family history, accounting for breast density.Results: Simple first-degree family history was associated with increased breast cancer risk compared with no first-degree history [Risk ratio (RR), 1.5; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.0-2.1 at age 40; RR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.3-1.7 at age 50; RR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.2-1.6 at age 60; RR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.1-1.5 at age 70). Breast cancer associations with detailed family history were strongest for women with first- and second-degree family history compared with no history (RR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.1-3.2 at age 40); this association weakened in higher age groups (RR, 1.2; 95% CI, 0.88-1.5 at age 70). Associations did not change substantially when adjusted for breast density.Conclusions: Even with adjustment for breast density, a history of breast cancer in both first- and second-degree relatives is more strongly associated with breast cancer than simple first-degree family history.Impact: Future efforts to improve breast cancer risk prediction models should evaluate detailed family history as a risk factor.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Women carrying BRCA-mutations are facing significant challenges, including decision making regarding surveillance and risk-reducing surgery. They often report that they are left alone with these important decisions. In order to enhance the genetic counselling session we organized a group-based patient education (GPE) course for women with BRCA-mutations. The study aims were to characterize women attending a group-based patient education (GPE) course for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer, consider the usefulness of the course, evaluate symptoms of anxiety and depression among the participants, and finally investigate whether their levels of anxiety and depression changed from before to after the course session.\nMETHODS: A prospective study was conducted. Two weeks before (T1) and 2 weeks after (T2) attending the GPE-course the participants received questionnaires by mail. We collected information on demographic- and medical variables, anxiety and depression using Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), self-efficacy using The Bergen Genetic Counseling Self-Efficacy scale (BGCSES) and coping style using the Threatening Medical Situations Inventory (TMSI). A total of N\u2009=\u2009100 (77% response rate) women participated at baseline and 75 (58% response rate) also completed post-course assessment.\nRESULTS: The mean level of anxiety symptoms was elevated among participants but decreased significantly during follow-up. Lower anxiety symptom levels were associated with \"longer time since disclosure of gene test result\", \"higher levels of self-efficacy\" and having experienced \"loss of a close relative due to breast or ovarian cancer\". Lower depression symptom levels were associated with \"higher levels of education\" and \"loss of a close relative due to breast or ovarian cancer\".\nCONCLUSION: The women in this study seemed to benefit from the GPE course. Women newly diagnosed with a BRCA mutation who reported lower levels of self-efficacy and lower levels of education were more vulnerable. These women need special attention.",

The study consisted of three parts: (i) attention: completion of the risk calculator while an eye tracker registered eye movements; (ii) recall: completion of a recall task; and (iii) interpretation: participation in a semi-structured interview.\nSETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: We recruited people from the target population through an advertisement in a local newspaper; 16 people participated in the study, which took place in our university laboratory.\nRESULTS: Eye-tracking data showed that participants looked most extensively at numerical risk information. Percentages were recalled well, whereas natural frequencies and verbal labels were remembered less well. Five qualitative themes were derived from the interview data: (i) numerical information does not really sink in; (ii) the verbal categorical label made no real impact on people; (iii) people relied heavily on existing knowledge and beliefs; (iv) people zoomed in on risk factors, especially family history of diseases; and (v) people often compared their situation to that of their peers.\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Although people paid attention to and recalled the risk information to a certain extent, they seemed to have difficulty in properly using this information for interpreting their risk.",

The study aims at assessing personality tendencies and orientations that could be closely correlated with knowledge, awareness, and interest toward undergoing genetic testing. Methods. A sample of 145 subjects in Italy completed an online survey, investigating demographic data, health orientation, level of perceived knowledge about genetic risk, genetic screening, and personal attitudes toward direct to consumer genetic testing (DTCGT). Results. Results showed that respondents considered genetic assessment to be helpful for disease prevention, but they were concerned that results could affect their life planning with little clinical utility. Furthermore, a very high percentage of respondents (67%) had never heard about genetic testing directly available to the public. Data showed that personality tendencies, such as personal health consciousness, health internal control, health esteem, and confidence, motivation to avoid unhealthiness and motivation for healthiness affected the uptake of genetic information and the interest in undergoing genetic testing. Conclusions. Public knowledge and attitudes toward genetic risk and genetic testing among European countries, along with individual personality and psychological tendencies that could affect these attitudes, remain unexplored. The present study constitutes one of the first attempts to investigate how such personality tendencies could motivation to undergo genetic testing and engagement in lifestyle changes.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Recognising a tumour predisposition syndrome (TPS) in patients with childhood cancer is of significant clinical relevance, as it affects treatment, prognosis and facilitates genetic counselling. Previous studies revealed that only half of the known TPSs are recognised during standard paediatric cancer care. In current medical practice it is impossible to refer every patient with childhood cancer to a clinical geneticist, due to limited capacity for routine genetic consultation. Therefore, we have developed a screening instrument to identify patients with childhood cancer with a high probability of having a TPS. The aim of this study is to validate the clinical screening instrument for TPS in patients with childhood cancer.\nMETHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study is a prospective nationwide cohort study including all newly diagnosed patients with childhood cancer in the Netherlands. The screening instrument consists of a checklist, two- and three-dimensional photographic series of the patient. 2 independent clinical geneticists will assess the content of the screening instrument. If a TPS is suspected based on the instrument data and thus further evaluation is indicated, the patient will be invited for full genetic consultation. A negative control group consists of 20% of the patients in whom a TPS is not suspected based on the instrument; they will be randomly invited for full genetic consultation. Primary outcome measurement will be sensitivity of the instrument.\nETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The Medical Ethical Committee of the Academic Medical Centre stated that the Medical Research Involving Human Subjects Act does not apply to this study and that official approval of this study by the Committee was not required. The results will be offered for publication in peer-reviewed journals and presented at International Conferences on Oncology and Clinical Genetics.

        "abstract": "Genetic counseling and testing for familial cancer is a unique context for the communication of risk information in the family. This study utilized a theoretical framework based on the family systems perspective to understand intrafamilial cancer risk communication patterns in the Ashkenazi Jewish population. Individuals (n\u00a0=\u00a0120) at an elevated risk for BRCA1/2 mutations were included. Change in communication patterns over time was assessed using McNemar tests. Associations with communication patterns were assessed with multivariable logistic regression. Overall, the proportion of participants encouraged by others significantly (p\u00a0<\u00a0.001) increased from before to after genetic counseling. A higher proportion of participants were encouraged by female family members compared with male family members. Participants who were older, had no personal history of cancer, and had a higher cancer risk perception were more likely to be encouraged by others for genetic testing. Participant's intent to encourage family members for genetic testing from before counseling to after receipt of genetic test results decreased by 16.7%. Participants who had no personal history of cancer and had informative test results for a BRCA1/2 mutation were more likely to encourage other family members for genetic testing. In addition, qualitative findings suggested that closeness among family members, concern for family, especially future generations, and cognizance about cancer risk facilitate information sharing and encouragement for genetic testing. Our findings indicate that intrafamilial cancer risk communication varies with the structure of family relationships and that genetic counseling can play an important role in improving intrafamilial cancer risk communication.",

Written in everyday language with minimal jargon, the Public Understanding and Attitudes towards Genetics and Genomics (PUGGS) questionnaire is intended for use in research on science education and public understanding of science, as a means to investigate relationships between knowledge, determinism and attitudes about modern genetics, which are to date little understood. We developed a set of core ideas and initial items from reviewing the scientific literature on genetics and previous studies on public and student knowledge and attitudes about genetics. Seventeen international experts from different fields (e.g., genetics, education, philosophy of science) reviewed the initial items and their feedback was used to revise the questionnaire. We validated the questionnaire in two pilot tests with samples of university freshmen students. The final questionnaire contains 45 items, including both multiple choice and Likert scale response formats. Cronbach alpha showed good reliability for each section of the questionnaire. In conclusion, the PUGGS questionnaire is a reliable tool for investigating public understanding and attitudes towards modern genetics and genomic-based technologies.",

However, much of the literature to date has focused on paid advertisement recruitment.\nOBJECTIVE: We used Lynch syndrome (LS), a rare hereditary cancer syndrome, as a model to demonstrate the successful partnership between researchers and a Web-based patient education and advocacy organization to facilitate participant recruitment.\nMETHODS: Recruitment was undertaken in partnership with Lynch Syndrome International (LSI), an advocacy organization with a strong social media presence. After LSI published our study information, participants followed up via email or phone call. Following prescreening and consent, interested and eligible participants were then sent a secure survey link.\nRESULTS: Within 36 hours of a single Facebook post by the site administrators for LSI, over 150 individuals responded via phone or email. Sixty-five individuals were sent the survey link and 57 individuals completed the survey (88% response rate). Of note, these 57 individuals were geographically diverse within the Unites States, representing LS patients from 26 different states.\nCONCLUSIONS: This approach has several advantages, including recruitment through a trusted source outside of a clinical setting, higher response rates, and cost-effectiveness with a small research team in a relatively short amount of time. Overall, social media recruitment with a trusted online partner can be highly effective in hard-to-reach clinical populations, such as patients with LS.

Pharmacogenomics is the basis of personalisation of the treatment able to allow higher medication success rates. In this review, we will present detailed examples of CVD drugs to highlight the complexity of this challenging field and we will discuss novel concepts that should be considered for a fastest integration of pharmacogenomics in clinical practice of CVD. Areas Covered: The complexity of pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics of CVD drugs are presented though examples of medications such as statins, with a focus on their effectiveness and adverse effects. Expert Opinion: The application of personalised medicine in the CVD medical practice requires the study of human genome with regard to drugs pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, interactions and tolerance profile. The existing state -of-the-art of CVD drugs gives hopes for a future revolution in the drug development that will maximise cardiovascular patients benefit while decreasing their risks for adverse effects. Article Highlights Box: \u2022 Coronary heart disease (CHD) remains the first cause of death worldwide. \u2022 Cardiovascular treatment has a significant percentage of insufficient efficacy, poor tolerance and compliance. \u2022 Predicting the response to therapy while diminishing the side effects is the basis of personalised medicine; pharmacogenomics is leading towards this direction. \u2022 The response to CVD therapy and side effects are in the heart of CVD pharmacogenomics and significant progress has been noted. \u2022 The application of pharmacogenomics in the CVD medical practice is facing many methodological, technical, ethical, behavioral and financial issues, while cost-effectiveness is the main prerequisite. \u2022 The consideration of gene \u00d7 gene \u00d7 environment interactions and the inclusion of \"omics\" data in pharmacogenomic studies of CVD drugs will facilitate the generation of reliable results and will promote tailored treatments and new strategies of drug research and development.",

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is an emerging technology that allows for rapid detection of a large number of genetic mutations in thyroid fine-needle aspiration (FNA) specimens. NGS for targeted mutational analysis in thyroid tumors has been proposed as a tool to assist in the diagnosis of thyroid nodules with indeterminate FNA cytology. Results of genomic testing of thyroid nodules and thyroid cancers could also have prognostic implications and play a role in determining optimal treatment strategies including targeted therapies. We provide a critical review of existing studies assessing the performance of the ThyroSeq NGS test for the diagnosis and management of patients with thyroid nodules with indeterminate cytopathology and discuss the applicability of findings from these studies to clinical practice. While there are early indications to suggest a possible utility of data obtained from NGS to aid in prognostication and therapeutic decision-making in thyroid cancer, we recommend judicious use and cautious interpretation of such molecular testing until results of ongoing clinical trials become available. Lastly, we discuss recommendations provided from clinical practice guidelines regarding the use of mutation detection via NGS in the diagnostic evaluation of thyroid nodules.",

        "abstract": "Thyroid fine-needle aspiration biopsy results are cytologically indeterminate in 15-30% of cases. When these nodules undergo diagnostic surgery, approximately three-quarters are histologically benign. These unnecessary surgeries diminish quality of life, generate complications, and increase healthcare costs. The Afirma gene expression classifier (GEC) is validated to pre-operatively identify cytologically indeterminate nodules likely to be truly benign so that surgery can be avoided. Its performance is supported by robust multicenter prospective and blinded clinical validation studies, and supported by extensive independent clinical utility publications which show a marked reduction in surgery among patients with benign Afirma GEC results. To rule-out cancer and avoid unnecessary diagnostic surgery, Afirma's quality and depth of validation stand alone. The accuracy of a benign result is the negative predictive value (NPV). Afirma achieves an NPV \u226594% among cytologically indeterminate nodules (Bethesda III or IV). Thirteen clinical utility studies describing 1468 GEC benign patients demonstrate that few Afirma GEC benign nodules undergo surgery, including after 3 years of follow-up. With a specificity of 52%, over half of the truly benign nodules with indeterminate cytology receive a benign GEC result. High test sensitivity is critical to safely rule out cancer. The Afirma GEC's 90% sensitivity means that regardless of the pre-test risk of malignancy, 90% of all malignant nodules are GEC suspicious. The Afirma GEC has transformed patient care. Where the majority of cytologically indeterminate patients were once operated to determine if the nodule was benign or malignant, now nearly half of these surgeries can be avoided.",

Ticagrelor is a potent but more expensive alternative antiplatelet agent that is not affected by CYP2C19 polymorphism. This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness, from the Hong Kong health-care provider's perspective, of CYP2C19*2 genotype-guided selection of antiplatelet therapy compared with the universal use of clopidogrel or ticagrelor among ACS patients who undergo percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). In the present study, a two-part model consisting of a 1-year decision tree and a lifetime Markov model was built to simulate the progress of a typical cohort of 60-year-old Chinese patients until age 85 years and compare three treatment strategies: (i) generic clopidogrel or ticagrelor based on CYP2C19*2 genotype, (ii) universal use of generic clopidogrel or (iii) universal use of ticagrelor for all patients. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of <1 gross domestic product per capita locally (US dollar (USD)42\u2009423/quality-adjusted life year (QALY)) were considered cost-effective. Base-case results showed universal ticagrelor use was cost-effective compared with universal clopidogrel, but was dominated by genotype-guided treatment. Genotype-guided treatment was cost-effective compared with universal clopidogrel use (ICER of USD2560/QALY). Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that with the cost of genotype testing up to USD400, CYP2C19*2 genotype-guided antiplatelet treatment remained a cost-effective strategy compared with either universal use of generic clopidogrel or ticagrelor in post-PCI ACS patients in Hong Kong.",

This is of particular interest in developing countries where the resources are limited and must be spent wisely to address social justice and the right for equal access in healthcare services by all the citizens in economically viable terms. In this light, the current allocation is, in practice, inefficient and rests mostly on each country's individual political and historical context and, thus, does not always incorporate decision-making enabled by economic models. In this study, we present a new economic model, specifically for resource allocation for genomic medicine, based on performance ratio, with potential applications in diverse healthcare sectors, which are particularly appealing for developing countries and low-resource environments. The model proposes a new method for resource allocation taking into account (1) the size of innovation of a new technology, (2) the relative effectiveness in comparison with social preferences, and (3) the cost of the technology, which permits the measurement of effectiveness to be determined differently in the context of a specific disease and then to be expressed in a relative form using a common performance ratio.

Recently, a unique prenatal phenotype was reported and TOP becomes a possibility.\nOBJECTIVE: To explore factors influencing the attitudes of parents of PWS children toward PND and TOP concerning a hypothetical pregnancy with a PWS fetus.\nMETHODS: All 85 parents of individuals with PWS were interviewed regarding their attitudes towards PND and TOP using semi-structured questionnaire.\nRESULTS: Fifty-seven parents were supportive of invasive PND and 28 of non-invasive tests only; none opposed PND. Thirty eight favored TOP, additional 31 supported TOP under certain conditions such as spiritual advice, 15 were categorically against TOP. Attitudes correlated with religiosity (p\u00a0<\u00a00.025), mother's education (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), mother's work status (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), current age of the child with PWS (p\u00a0<\u00a00.008). Couples had similar attitudes regarding PND and TOP. No correlation was found with gender, genetic subtype and parental age.\nCONCLUSIONS: Most parents of individuals with PWS support PND, however less than half support TOP. Religiosity was the most influential factor. Familial worldview should be taken into account during prenatal counseling.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There is virtually no information assessing the insurability of families affected with Sudden Arrhythmia Death Syndromes (SADS) for the determination of the nonclinical implications of genetic screening. It is important to identify the barriers and challenges faced by families as a result of genetic screening for SADS to enable equitable access to insurance coverage.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: To explore the insurance coverage experiences of SADS-affected families, we administered a cross-sectional online survey across North America from April 28, 2012 to November 13, 2013. Participants included individuals with a SADS diagnosis and their relatives who have applied for insurance (health, life, travel, and disability) or have existing insurance coverage. Of 202 participants, 92% had a SADS diagnosis (92%) as either a proband (50%) or an affected relative (42%); 8% of participants were unaffected family members of a proband; and genetic confirmation was reported by 73%. Of the 54% of SADS respondents who applied for insurance, 60% were rejected by insurers. The preexisting SADS diagnosis was the major reason reported for rejection (57%). Most respondents (80%) had insurance coverage through a spouse/parent plan at the time of diagnosis; 14% experienced a subsequent negative effect on coverage. Thirty-nine percent of affected SADS respondents reported an increase in insurance premium rates.\nCONCLUSIONS: Increased genetic testing has negatively impacted insurability for SADS patients and affected family members. The challenges in obtaining life and health insurance are mainly because of the preexisting condition, even in the presence of protective laws in the United States.",

        "abstract": "Increasing evidence supports the benefit of identifying BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline mutations in early breast cancer. Selection of patients for genetic testing is based on defined criteria taking individual and family history related factors into account. It is important to make a distinction between efficacy and effectiveness of BRCA testing criteria. Efficacy can be defined as the performance under ideal circumstances, whereas effectiveness refers to its real life performance. To allow for an unbiased and detailed evaluation of efficacy and effectiveness of the Swedish BRCA testing criteria, we retrospectively analyzed a prospectively collected cohort of 273 breast cancer patients from the well-characterized, population-based, single-site All Breast Cancer in Malm\u00f6 (ABiM) study. The patients were diagnosed with breast cancer during the years 2007 through 2009. Out of 20 mutation carriers identified, 13 fulfilled Swedish criteria at time of diagnosis. Thus, the efficacy of these criteria was 65%. Excluding three patients in whom a mutation was already known at time of diagnosis, only 3/17 had been identified in the clinical routine, corresponding to an effectiveness of 18%. Here we detail the reasons why mutation carriers in our cohort were not detected though routine health care. In conclusion, effectiveness of BRCA testing criteria was much lower than efficacy. Our results indicate that current testing criteria and procedures associated with BRCA1 and BRCA2 testing are insufficient. There is room for improvement of their efficacy, but even more so regarding effectiveness. Clinical BRCA testing routines need to be critically revised.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the utility of a breast cancer risk assessment (BCRA) at the time of screening mammogram. Women whose BCRA indicated a high risk for cancer received a letter with instructions for breast health care and genetic counseling if appropriate. After 6\u00a0months this group received surveys to evaluate their risk perception and their recall of, and compliance with, recommendations. We also explored the impact of other variables such as a recommendation for genetic counseling and physician communication with the women. After the BCRA, the majority of high risk women reported no change in their perceived risk of cancer. A woman's perceived risk of cancer after a BCRA was significantly associated with her recall of recommendations for breast health care, but not with compliance. A recommendation for genetic counseling was not significantly related to women's perceived risk of cancer after the BCRA. Ten percent of women who should have obtained genetic counseling actually completed an appointment. Women who discussed their BCRA results with their physicians were more compliant with a six month breast exam with a doctor (53% vs 17%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.018). Overall, women felt that the BCRA was helpful and did not cause undue stress or anxiety. Although the cohort's compliance with recommendations was suboptimal, physicians' interactions with their patients may have a positive influence on their compliance.",

        "abstract": "Precision medicine entails tailoring treatment based on patients' unique characteristics. As drug therapy constitutes the cornerstone of treatment for most chronic diseases, pharmacogenomics (PGx), the study of genetic variation influencing individual response to drugs, is an important component of precision medicine. Over the past decade investigations have identified genes and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and quantified their effect on drug response. Parallel development of point-of-care (POC) genotyping platforms has enabled the interrogation of the genes/SNPs within a timeline conducive to the provision of care. Despite these advances, the pace of integration of genotype-guided drug therapy (GGTx) into practice has faced significant challenges. These include difficulty in identifying SNPs with sufficiently robust evidence to guide clinical decision making, lack of clinician training on how to order and use genotype data, lack of clinical decision support (CDS) to guide treatment, and limited reimbursement. The University of Alabama at Birmingham's (UAB) efforts in precision medicine were initiated to address these challenges and improve the health of the racially diverse patients we treat.",

A main challenge is the systematic interpretation of whole-exome sequencing (WES) data for clinical care.\nMETHODS: One hundred sixty-five adults with metastatic colorectal and lung adenocarcinomas were prospectively enrolled in the CanSeq study. WES was performed on DNA extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor biopsy samples and matched blood samples. Somatic and germ-line alterations were ranked according to therapeutic or clinical relevance. Results were interpreted using an integrated somatic and germ-line framework and returned in accordance with patient preferences.\nRESULTS: At the time of this analysis, WES had been performed and results returned to the clinical team for 165 participants. Of 768 curated somatic alterations, only 31% were associated with clinical evidence and 69% with preclinical or inferential evidence. Of 806 curated germ-line variants, 5% were clinically relevant and 56% were classified as variants of unknown significance. The variant review and decision-making processes were effective when the process was changed from that of a Molecular Tumor Board to a protocol-based approach.\nCONCLUSION: The development of novel interpretive and decision-support tools that draw from scientific and clinical evidence will be crucial for the success of cancer precision medicine in WES studies.Genet Med advance online publication 26 January 2017.",

The ratio of SMN1 to SMN2 was calculated based on a single-nucleotide difference that distinguishes the two genes. SMN1 copy-number results were compared between the NGS and quantitative polymerase chain reaction and/or multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. The NGS data set was also queried for the g.27134T>G single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and other SMN1 sequence pathogenic variants.\nRESULTS: The sensitivity of the test to detect spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) carriers with one copy of SMN1 was 100% (95% confidence interval (CI): 95.9-100%; n = 90) and specificity was 99.6% (95% CI: 99.4-99.7%; n = 6,648). Detection of the g.27134T>G SNP by NGS was 100% concordant with an restriction fragment-length polymorphism method (n = 493). Ten single-nucleotide variants in SMN1 were detectable by NGS and confirmed by gene-specific amplicon-based sequencing. This comprehensive approach yielded SMA carrier detection rates of 90.3-95.0% in five ethnic groups studied.\nCONCLUSION: We have developed a novel, comprehensive SMN1 copy-number and sequence variant analysis method by NGS that demonstrated improved SMA carrier detection rates across the entire population examined.Genet Med advance online publication 19 January 2017.",

The primary source of data was 2013 Medicare 100% fee-for-service claims. We identified claims billed for each laboratory test, the number of patients tested, expenditures, and the diagnostic codes indicated for testing. We analyzed variations in testing by patient demographics and region of the country.\nRESULTS: Pharmacogenetic tests were billed most frequently, accounting for 48% of the expenditures for new codes. The most common indications for testing were breast cancer, long-term use of medications, and disorders of lipid metabolism. There was underutilization of guideline-recommended tumor mutation tests (e.g., epidermal growth factor receptor) and substantial overutilization of a test discouraged by guidelines (methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase). Methodology-based tier 2 codes represented 15% of all claims billed with the new codes. The highest rate of testing per beneficiary was in Mississippi and the lowest rate was in Alaska.\nCONCLUSIONS: Gene-specific billing codes significantly improved our ability to conduct population-level research of precision medicine.

Here, we explore the feasibility of a next-generation sequencing (NGS) screening method specifically for the Dai people.\nMETHODS: Blood samples were obtained from Dai people for premarital screening. Double-blind, parallel hemoglobinopathy screening was conducted using both traditional hematological methods (red cell indexes and hemoglobin electrophoresis, then DNA sequencing) and an NGS approach.\nRESULTS: Among 951 tested individuals, we found a thalassemia carrier rate of 49.5% (471/951) using the NGS screen, in contrast to 22.0% (209/951) found using traditional methods. Almost 74.8% (217/290) of \u03b1-thalassemia carriers and 30.5% (25/82) of composite \u03b1- and \u03b2-thalassemia carriers were missed by traditional screens. The proportion of such \u03b1- and \u03b2-thalassemia carriers among the Dai people is 8.6% (82/951). For \u03b2-thalassemia carriers, the high ratio (66/99) of CD26 mutations may suggest a correlation between CD26 and the environmental adaption of the Dai people.\nCONCLUSIONS: Methodological comparisons demonstrate the superiority of NGS for both sensitivity and specificity, provide a comprehensive assessment of thalassemia screening strategies, and indicate that NGS is a competitive screening method, especially among populations with a high prevalence of disease.Genet Med advance online publication 26 January 2017.",

However, there is a dearth of trained geneticists and genetic counselors to help guide and explain these conditions and relevant tests. To help hospitalists, neonatologists, and related practitioners navigate this complex and evolving field, we have compiled a list of free (mostly Web-based) resources relevant to the diagnosis and management of genetic conditions and related disorders. These resources, which we describe individually, can be useful for nongeneticist clinicians, and some also include material that can be used to explain concepts and conditions to patients or families. The resources presented are divided into the following categories (which overlap): general information, databases of genetic conditions, resources that can help generate differential diagnoses, databases of genetic testing laboratories (to help with logistics of ordering tests), information on newborn screening, and other resources. We also include a separate list of helpful textbooks and manuals. We conclude with 2 examples describing how some of these resources would be used by a pediatric hospitalist or neonatologist during the inpatient management of a child with a suspected genetic condition.",

Despite their clinical benefit, they are associated with frequent gastrointestinal and hematological toxicities, which often lead to treatment discontinuation. Fluoropyrimidines undergo complex anabolic and catabolic biotransformation. Enzymes involved in this pathway include dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD), which breaks down 5-FU and its prodrugs. Candidate gene approaches have demonstrated associations between 5-FU treatment outcomes and germline polymorphisms in DPD.

Nowadays, there is a general agreement on the clinical significance of the importance of DPD deficiency in patients who suffer from severe, life-threatening drug toxicity although preemptive testing is not applied to all patients.\nCONCLUSION: Considering the published literature, clinicians are strongly encouraged to consider testing for DPD poor metabolizer variants as a rational pre-treatment screening for patients candidate to a fluoropyrimidine-based regimens, in order to prevent toxicities and personalise treatments.",

Despite these efforts, the application of diagnostic criteria has been variable and caused confusion.\nSTUDY DESIGN: To improve diagnosis and achieve standardization in terms and definitions worldwide, the CF Foundation in 2015 convened a committee of 32 experts in the diagnosis of CF from 9 countries. As part of the process, all previous consensus-seeking exercises sponsored by the CF Foundation, along with the important efforts of the European CF Society, were comprehensively and critically reviewed. The goal was to better understand why consensus conferences and their publications have not led to the desired results.\nRESULTS: Lessons learned from previous diagnosis consensus processes and products were identified. It was decided that participation in developing a consensus was generally not inclusive enough for global impact. It was also found that many efforts to address sweat test issues were valuable but did not always improve clinical practices as CF diagnostic testing evolved. It also became clear from this review that premature applications of potential diagnostic tests such as nasal potential difference and intestinal current measurement should be avoided until validation and standardization occur. Finally, we have learned that due to the significant and growing number of cases that are challenging to diagnose, an associated continuing medical education program is both desirable and necessary.\nCONCLUSIONS: It is necessary but not sufficient to organize and publish CF diagnosis consensus processes.

The identification of 2 disease-causing mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in an individual with a phenotype provides evidence that the disease is CF. However, not all variations in CFTR always result in CF. Therefore, for CFTR genotype to provide the same level of evidence of CFTR dysfunction as shown by direct tests such as sweat chloride or nasal potential difference, the mutations identified must be known to always result in CF. The use of CFTR genetics in CF diagnosis, therefore, relies heavily on mutation interpretation.\nSTUDY DESIGN: Progress that has been made on mutation interpretation and annotation was reviewed at the recent CF Foundation Diagnosis Consensus Conference. A modified Delphi method was used to identify consensus statements on the use of genetic analysis in CF diagnosis.\nRESULTS: The largest recent advance in CF genetics has come through the Clinical and Functional Translation of CFTR (CFTR2) project. This undertaking seeks to characterize CFTR mutations from patients with CF around the world. The project also established guidelines for the clinical, functional, and population/penetrance criteria that can be used to interpret mutations not yet included in CFTR2's review.\nCONCLUSIONS: The use of CFTR genetics to aid in diagnosis of CF requires that the mutations identified have a known disease liability. The demonstration of 2 in trans mutations known to always result in CF is satisfactory evidence of CFTR dysfunction. However, if the identified mutations are known to be associated with variable outcomes, or have unknown consequence, that genotype may not result in a CF phenotype. In these cases, other tests of CFTR function may help.",

These were approved by 80% or more of the participants.\nCONCLUSIONS: It is recommended that all diagnoses be established by demonstrating dysfunction of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) channel, initially with a sweat chloride test and, when needed, potentially with newer methods assessing membrane transport directly, such as intestinal current measurements. Even in babies with 2 CF-causing mutations detected via NBS, diagnosis must be confirmed by demonstrating CFTR dysfunction. The committee also recommends that the latest classifications identified in the Clinical and Functional Translation of CFTR project [http://www.cftr2.org/index.php] should be used to aid with CF diagnosis.

These infants are classified as CF transmembrane conductance regulator-related metabolic syndrome (CRMS) in the US and CF screen positive, inconclusive diagnosis (CFSPID) in other countries. Diagnostic and management decisions of these infants are challenges for CF healthcare professionals and stressful situations for families. As CF NBS has become more widespread across the world, increased information about the epidemiology and outcomes of these infants is becoming available. These data were reviewed at the 2015 CF Foundation Diagnosis Consensus Conference, and a harmonized definition of CRMS and CFSPID was developed.\nSTUDY DESIGN: At the consensus conference, participants reviewed published and unpublished studies of CRMS/CFSPID and used a modified Delphi methodology to develop a harmonized approach to the definition of CRMS/CFSPID.\nRESULTS: Several studies of CRMS/CFSPID from populations around the world have been published in the past year. Although the studies vary in the number of infants studied, study design, and outcome measures, there have been some consistent findings. CRMS/CFSPID occurs relatively frequently, with CF:CRMS that ranges from 3 to 5 cases of CF for every 1 case of CRMS/CFSPID in regions where gene sequencing is not used. The incidence varies by NBS protocol used, and in some regions more cases of CRMS/CFSPID are detected than cases of CF. The majority of individuals with CRMS/CFSPID do not develop CF disease or progress to a diagnosis of CF. However, between 10% and 20% of asymptomatic infants can develop clinical features concerning for CF, such as a respiratory culture positive for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Most studies have only reported short-term outcomes in the first 1-3 years of life; the long-term outcomes of CRMS/CFSPID remain unknown. The European CF Society definition of CFSPID and the CF Foundation definition of CRMS differ only slightly, and the consensus conference was able to create a unified definition of CRMS/CFSPID.\nCONCLUSIONS: CRMS/CFSPID is a relatively common outcome of CF NBS, and clinicians need to be prepared to counsel families whose NBS test falls into this classification. The vast majority of infants with CRMS/CFSPID will remain free from disease manifestations early in life. However, a small proportion may develop clinical features concerning for CF or demonstrate progression to a clinical phenotype compatible with a CF diagnosis, and their long-term outcomes are not known. A consistent international definition of CRMS/CFSPID will allow for better data collection for study of outcomes and result in improved patient care.",

        "title": "Diagnosis of Cystic Fibrosis in Nonscreened Populations.",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Although the majority of cases of cystic fibrosis (CF) are now diagnosed through newborn screening, there is still a need to standardize the diagnostic criteria for those diagnosed outside of the neonatal period. This is because newborn screening started relatively recently, it is not performed everywhere, and even for individuals who were screened, there is the possibility of a false negative. To limit irreversible organ pathology, a timely diagnosis of CF and institution of CF therapies can greatly benefit these patients.\nSTUDY DESIGN: Experts on CF diagnosis were convened at the 2015 CF Foundation Diagnosis Consensus Conference. The participants reviewed and discussed published works and instructive cases of CF diagnosis in individuals presenting with signs, symptoms, or a family history of CF. Through a modified Delphi methodology, several consensus statements were agreed upon. These consensus statements were updates of prior CF diagnosis conferences and recommendations.\nRESULTS: CF diagnosis in individuals outside of newborn screening relies on the clinical evidence and on evidence of CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) dysfunction. Clinical evidence can include typical organ pathologies seen in CF such as bronchiectasis or pancreatic insufficiency but often represent a broad range of severity including mild cases. CFTR dysfunction can be demonstrated using sweat chloride testing, CFTR molecular genetic analysis, or CFTR physiologic tests. On the basis of the large number of patients with bona fide CF currently followed in registries with sweat chloride levels between 30 and 40\u2009mmol/L, the threshold considered \"intermediate\" was lowered from 40\u2009mmol/L in the prior diagnostic guidelines to 30\u2009mmol/L. The CF diagnosis was also discussed in the context of CFTR-related disorders in which CFTR dysfunction may be present, but the individual does not meet criteria for CF.\nCONCLUSIONS: CF diagnosis remains a rare but important condition that can be diagnosed when characteristic clinical features are seen in an individual with demonstrated CFTR dysfunction.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The phrase \"high-risk for breast cancer\" is used to identify various groups at elevated cancer risk, and the appropriate surveillance and risk-reducing strategies differ based on the etiology of risk. Here, we review the utility of patient-reported data to capture women with modifiable lifestyle risk factors and those suitable for genetic counseling referral.\nMETHODS: Patient-reported data from a web-based survey were used to capture personal history, multi-generational family history, and lifestyle factors (body mass index, alcohol consumption, physical activity). Responses were tabulated, and percentage of patients who met criteria for possible intervention calculated.\nRESULTS: 1277 women completed the survey from October 2014 to December 2015. Women were considered high risk for a combination of the following: family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer (77%), history of atypical hyperplasia or lobular carcinoma in situ (35%), known breast cancer-related gene mutation (11%). Based on self-reported data, 65% qualified for genetic evaluation but 40% reporting no prior testing. Only half of the population met national physical activity recommendations, nearly 40% were overweight/obese, and 18% reported consuming \u22651 alcoholic beverage per day.\nCONCLUSIONS: Among women followed in a high-risk breast surveillance program, there is considerable opportunity for improved genetic referral and awareness of modifiable lifestyle factors based on self-reported data as 60% of respondents reported a possible area for intervention. While risk reduction associated with lifestyle changes is modest in comparison to chemoprevention or surgery, such changes are practically without risk, minimally expensive, and provide innumerable secondary health benefits.",

        "abstract": "To assess how participants receiving abnormal prenatal genetic testing results seek information and understand the implications of results, 27 US female patients and 12 of their male partners receiving positive prenatal microarray testing results completed semi-structured phone interviews. These interviews documented participant experiences with chromosomal microarray testing, understanding of and emotional response to receiving results, factors affecting decision-making about testing and pregnancy termination, and psychosocial needs throughout the testing process. Interview data were analyzed using a modified grounded theory approach. In the absence of certainty about the implications of results, understanding of results is shaped by biomedical expert knowledge (BEK) and cultural expert knowledge (CEK). When there is a dearth of BEK, as in the case of receiving results of uncertain significance, participants rely on CEK, including religious/spiritual beliefs, \"gut instinct,\" embodied knowledge, and social network informants. CEK is a powerful platform to guide understanding of prenatal genetic testing results. The utility of culturally situated expert knowledge during testing uncertainty emphasizes that decision-making occurs within discourses beyond the biomedical domain. These forms of \"knowing\" may be integrated into clinical consideration of efficacious patient assessment and counseling.",

Today, however, the use of toxicogenomics data in HHRA is very limited. The purpose of this survey was to identify barriers to the application of toxicogenomics data in HHRA by human health risk assessors. An online survey targeting Canadian risk assessors gathered information on their knowledge and perception of toxicogenomics, their current and future inclusion of toxicogenomics data in HHRA, and barriers to the use of such data. Twenty-nine (29) participants completed a questionnaire after 2 months of solicitation. The results show that the application of toxicogenomics data in Canada is marginal, with 85% of respondents reporting that they never or rarely used such data. Knowledge of toxicogenomics by Canadian risk assessors is also limited: about two-thirds of respondents (68%) were not at all or only slightly familiar with the concept. Lack of guidelines for toxicogenomics data interpretation, data quality assessment and on their use in HHRA, were found to be major barriers. In conclusion, there is a need for interventions aimed at facilitating the use of toxicogenomics data in HHRA, when available.",

Analysis of interviews with 20 women revealed they engage in logical and emotional decision-making styles. Although women want to be logical to reduce their hereditary cancer risk, emotions often complicate their decision-making. Women experience fear and worry about a future cancer diagnosis, yet also desire to create a family, particularly having children through natural conception. That is, women negotiate having preventative surgeries in a logical doctor-recommended timeframe but also organize those decisions around emotional desires of motherhood. Overall, this study demonstrates the complex decisions women who test positive for a BRCA mutation must make in regards to genetic testing timing, family planning, and overall quality of life.",

In total, 725 high-risk women with a family history of fragile X syndrome (FXS) or idiopathic intellectual disability, 3911 low-risk pregnant women without such family history, and prenatal diagnosis data for 32 foetuses from 24 carrier mothers were included. Only 2 carriers were in the low-risk group, which indicated a prevalence of 1 of 1955 women (95% confidence interval: 1/7156-1/539). A total of 100 carriers were found to be in the high-risk group, thus revealing a significantly higher frequency than the low-risk group (100/725 vs 2/3911, P<0.0001). Eight of the 14 foetuses that inherited the maternal mutant allele were verified to have a full mutation, with the smallest maternal pre-mutation allele carrying 56 CGG repeats. The overall findings confirmed that the carrier prevalence among low-risk women in Taiwan is significantly lower than that reported in western countries. Therefore, the most important step for preventing FXS in Taiwan would be to focus on high-risk women by promoting general awareness of this disease and spreading knowledge regarding the benefits of carrier screening and prenatal testing.",

However, no established guidelines exist for the type of information physicians should cover during discussions with the patient about the test or its results. The objectives of this study were to identify physician and patient preferences regarding information and who should communicate this information and how to inform guidelines for these conversations.\nMETHODS: Physicians and patients who participated in discussions regarding molecular testing were asked to choose 8 topics of most relevance out of a list of 18. The McNemar test was used to determine their top preferences. Patients were asked to identify what information they wanted to receive and who should inform them, and physicians were asked to identify the best aid to communication.\nRESULTS: Sixty-six patients identified 12 preferred topics: the benefits of testing (88%), how testing determines treatment (88%), implications for family (71%), whether a test indicates the seriousness of disease (68%), purpose of the test (64%), incidental findings (56%), explanation of cancer genetics (53%), how the test is done (46%), limitations (44%), explanation of biomarker (42%), risks (42%), and uninformative results (38%). Physicians added cost (59%). Patients preferred receiving information about molecular testing from their nurse or physician (85%), and physicians preferred using a pamphlet (67%) to augment communication.\nCONCLUSIONS: The topics identified as important to discuss can inform future guidelines and can contribute to effective communication regarding molecular testing.

        "abstract": "Purpose: Women at familial/genetic ovarian cancer risk often undergo screening despite unproven efficacy. Research suggests each woman has her own CA125 baseline; significant increases above this level may identify cancers earlier than standard 6- to 12-monthly CA125 &gt; 35 U/mL.Experimental Design: Data from prospective Cancer Genetics Network and Gynecologic Oncology Group trials, which screened 3,692 women (13,080 woman-screening years) with a strong breast/ovarian cancer family history or BRCA1/2 mutations, were combined to assess a novel screening strategy. Specifically, serum CA125 q3 months, evaluated using a risk of ovarian cancer algorithm (ROCA), detected significant increases above each subject's baseline, which triggered transvaginal ultrasound. Specificity and positive predictive value (PPV) were compared with levels derived from general population screening (specificity 90%, PPV 10%), and stage-at-detection was compared with historical high-risk controls.Results: Specificity for ultrasound referral was 92% versus 90% (P = 0.0001), and PPV was 4.6% versus 10% (P &gt; 0.10). Eighteen of 19 malignant ovarian neoplasms [prevalent = 4, incident = 6, risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) = 9] were detected via screening or RRSO. Among incident cases (which best reflect long-term screening performance), three of six invasive cancers were early-stage (I/II; 50% vs. 10% historical BRCA1 controls; P = 0.016). Six of nine RRSO-related cases were stage I. ROCA flagged three of six (50%) incident cases before CA125 exceeded 35 U/mL. Eight of nine patients with stages 0/I/II ovarian cancer were alive at last follow-up (median 6 years).Conclusions: For screened women at familial/genetic ovarian cancer risk, ROCA q3 months had better early-stage sensitivity at high specificity, and low yet possibly acceptable PPV compared with CA125 &gt; 35 U/mL q6/q12 months, warranting further larger cohort evaluation.

The multi-gene expression-based assay, Oncotype DX\u00ae (ODX), is a genomic tumor profiling tool that determines the expression of 21 tumor- associated genes; it helps determine the risk for distant recurrence and whether chemotherapy is an appropriate course of treatment in patients with early stage, estrogen receptor (ER) positive, HER2 negative, and lymph node negative (or 1-3 positive lymph nodes) invasive BCa. The aim of this study was to determine the overall utilization and uptake of the ODX genomic test in a cross-sectional analysis of the Virginia Tumor registry, compare utilization in African Americans (AAs) and Caucasian Americans (CAs), and determine the profile of patients referred for testing. Caucasian (89.7%) patients made up the majority of the ODX testers compared to AAs (10.3%) (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). Those who received ODX testing were less likely to have higher grade and higher stage tumors, and were less likely to be ER negative (RR\u00a0=\u00a00.21, 95% CI: 0.01-0.31), progesterone receptor (PR) negative (RR\u00a0=\u00a00.35, 95% CI: 0.27-0.45), HER2 amplified (RR\u00a0=\u00a00.27, 95% CI: 0.17-0.43), or triple negative (RR\u00a0=\u00a00.21, 95% CI: 0.14-0.33).

Which MAGs are returned affects the harms and benefits of every genetic testing endeavor. Despite published recommendations of selection criteria for MAGs to return, scant data exist regarding how decision makers actually apply such criteria.\nMETHODS: The process and criteria used by researchers when selecting MAGs for a preventive genomic sequencing program targeting the general adult population were examined. The authors observed and audio-recorded the gene selection meetings, and analyzed meeting transcripts, gene scoring sheets, and meeting handouts.\nRESULTS: To select MAGs, the committee imported, from a preexisting project, \"a semiquantitative metric\" that scores genes on five criteria. Numerous subjective judgments and conceptual challenges in defining and applying the five criteria complicated the selection process. Criteria-related challenges also included the limited evidence available about facts fundamental to the scoring decisions and the emergence and application of criteria that were not part of the original metric.\nCONCLUSIONS: When identifying MAGs appropriate for screening and return, decision makers must expect and prepare to address such issues as the inevitability of subjective judgments, limited evidence about fundamental decision-making elements, the conceptual complexity of defining criteria, and the emergence of unplanned criteria during the gene selection process.",

Pre-surgical BRCA1/2 genetic testing can provide valuable risk information to guide this choice. However, little is understood about why BRCA1/2 mutation noncarriers, who are generally not at substantially elevated risk of contralateral disease, select CPM.\nMETHODS: We examined the uptake of CPM among breast cancer patients identified as BRCA1/2 mutation noncarriers (n\u00a0=\u00a092) as part of a larger prospective study of the impact of pre-surgical BRCA1/2 testing. Data obtained from self-report questionnaires and patient medical records were used to examine associations between theoretically relevant background and psychosocial factors and BRCA1/2 mutation noncarriers' decisions to undergo CPM.\nRESULTS: Among BRCA1/2 mutation noncarriers, 25% (n\u00a0=\u00a023) elected to undergo CPM. Psychosocial factors including a self-reported physician recommendation for CPM, greater perceived contralateral breast cancer risk, and greater perceived benefits of CPM were all significantly associated with the uptake of CPM.\nCONCLUSIONS: A sizeable minority of BRCA1/2 mutation noncarriers choose to undergo CPM after learning their mutation status through pre-surgical genetic testing. BRCA1/2 mutation noncarriers' cognitive perceptions and social influences appear to be important in shaping their decisions regarding CPM. This work highlights the importance of several psychosocial factors in influencing patients' surgical decisions. Future research is needed that examines the formation of BRCA1/2 mutation noncarriers' beliefs regarding their disease and available treatment options, and that characterizes the physician-patient communication that occurs in this complex decision-making context.",

However, no patients manifested major metabolic decompensation. Developmental outcomes correlated more closely with initial metabolic abnormalities than with long-term metabolic control. Increased intake of medical foods resulted in better control but also perturbations in the ratios of essential amino acids and lower z-scores for head circumference. We found no relationship between diet and cognitive outcomes.\nCONCLUSIONS: Although dietary therapy for cblC patients improves metabolic control, few patients experience metabolic decompensation regardless of diet. Increased incomplete protein intake is not correlated with improvements in outcomes.

We assessed the clinical impact of pharmacogenetic profiling integrating binary and cumulative drug and gene interaction warnings on home health polypharmacy patients.\nMETHODS AND FINDINGS: This prospective, open-label, randomized controlled trial was conducted at one hospital-based home health agency between February 2015 and February 2016. Recruitment came from patient referrals to home health at hospital discharge. Eligible patients were aged 50 years and older and taking or initiating treatment with medications with potential or significant drug-gene-based interactions. Subjects (n = 110) were randomized to pharmacogenetic profiling (n = 57). The study pharmacist reviewed drug-drug, drug-gene, and cumulative drug and/or gene interactions using the YouScript\u00ae CDST to provide drug therapy recommendations to clinicians. The control group (n = 53) received treatment as usual including pharmacist guided medication management using a standard drug information resource. The primary outcome measure was the number of re-hospitalizations and ED visits at 30 and 60 days after discharge from the hospital. The mean number of re-hospitalizations per patient in the tested vs. untested group was 0.25 vs. 0.38 at 30 days (relative risk (RR), 0.65; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.32-1.28; P = 0.21) and 0.33 vs. 0.70 at 60 days following enrollment (RR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.27-0.82; P = 0.007). The mean number of ED visits per patient in the tested vs. untested group was 0.25 vs. 0.40 at 30 days (RR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.31-1.21; P = 0.16) and 0.39 vs. 0.66 at 60 days (RR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.34-0.99; P = 0.045). Differences in composite outcomes at 60 days (exploratory endpoints) were also found. Of the total 124 drug therapy recommendations passed on to clinicians, 96 (77%) were followed. These findings should be verified with additional prospective confirmatory studies involving real-world applications in larger populations to broaden acceptance in routine clinical practice.\nCONCLUSIONS: Pharmacogenetic testing of polypharmacy patients aged 50 and older, supported by an appropriate CDST, considerably reduced re-hospitalizations and ED visits at 60 days following enrollment resulting in potential health resource utilization savings and improved healthcare.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02378220.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Dystrophinopathy is one of the most common human monogenic diseases which results in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD). Mutations in the dystrophin gene are responsible for both DMD and BMD. However, the clinical phenotypes and treatments are quite different in these two muscular dystrophies. Since early diagnosis and treatment results in better clinical outcome in DMD it is essential to establish accurate early diagnosis of DMD to allow efficient management. Previously, the reading-frame rule was used to predict DMD versus BMD. However, there are limitations using this traditional tool. Here, we report a novel molecular method to improve the accuracy of predicting clinical phenotypes in dystrophinopathy. We utilized several additional molecular genetic rules or patterns such as \"ambush hypothesis\", \"hidden stop codons\" and \"exonic splicing enhancer (ESE)\" to predict the expressed clinical phenotypes as DMD versus BMD.\nRESULTS: A computer software \"DMDtoolkit\" was developed to visualize the structure and to predict the functional changes of mutated dystrophin protein. It also assists statistical prediction for clinical phenotypes. Using the DMDtoolkit we showed that the accuracy of predicting DMD versus BMD raised about 3% in all types of dystrophin mutations when compared with previous methods. We performed statistical analyses using correlation coefficients, regression coefficients, pedigree graphs, histograms, scatter plots with trend lines, and stem and leaf plots.\nCONCLUSIONS: We present a novel DMDtoolkit, to improve the accuracy of clinical diagnosis for DMD/BMD. This computer program allows automatic and comprehensive identification of clinical risk and allowing them the benefit of early medication treatments.

We used software that assists with qualitative data analysis to conduct a thematic analysis of these documents.\nRESULTS: Surprisingly considering how contentious broad consent is in Africa, we found that most countries allow the use of this consent model, with its use banned in only three of the countries we investigated. In a likely response to fears about exploitation, the export of samples outside of the continent is strictly regulated, sometimes in conjunction with regulations around international collaboration. We also found that whilst an essential and critical component of ensuring ethical best practice in genomics research relates to the governance framework that accompanies sample and data sharing, this was most sparingly covered in the guidelines.\nCONCLUSIONS: There is a need for ethics guidelines in African countries to be adapted to the changing science policy landscape, which increasingly supports principles of openness, storage, sharing and secondary use. Current guidelines are not pertinent to the ethical challenges that such a new orientation raises, and therefore fail to provide accurate guidance to ethics committees and researchers.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the degree of consensus among clinicians on the clinical use of genetic testing in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and the factors that determine decision-making.\nMETHODS: ALS researchers worldwide were invited to participate in a detailed online survey to determine their attitudes and practices relating to genetic testing.\nRESULTS: Responses from 167 clinicians from 21 different countries were analyzed. The majority of respondents (73.3%) do not consider that there is a consensus definition of familial ALS (FALS). Fifty-seven percent consider a family history of frontotemporal dementia and 48.5% the presence of a known ALS genetic mutation as sufficient for a diagnosis of FALS. Most respondents (90.2%) offer genetic testing to patients they define as having FALS and 49.4% to patients with sporadic ALS. Four main genes (SOD1, C9orf72, TARDBP, and FUS) are commonly tested. A total of 55.2% of respondents would seek genetic testing if they had personally received a diagnosis of ALS. Forty-two percent never offer presymptomatic testing to family members of patients with FALS. Responses varied between ALS specialists and nonspecialists and based on the number of new patients seen per year.\nCONCLUSIONS: There is a lack of consensus among clinicians as to the definition of FALS. Substantial variation exists in attitude and practices related to genetic testing of patients and presymptomatic testing of their relatives across geographic regions and between experienced specialists in ALS and nonspecialists.",

        "abstract": "There is robust evidence that the interparental relationship and parenting behaviors each have a significant influence on children's risk for emotional (internalizing) and behavioral (externalizing) problems. Indeed, interventions targeting the interparental relationship and parenting processes show significant intervention-related reductions in child internalizing and externalizing problems. However, most evidence-based parenting- and couple-focused interventions result in small to medium effects on children's emotional and behavior problems. It is proposed that there is opportunity to improve upon these interventions through incorporation of knowledge from quantitative genetic research. Three core recommendations are provided for practitioners engaging in intervention work with children and families. These recommendations are contextualized relative to what quantitative genetic studies can tell us about the role of the interparental relationship and parenting behaviors on child outcomes.",

The presence of polygenic hypercholesterolemia was further evaluated by genotyping 6 low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)-raising single-nucleotide polymorphisms.\nRESULTS: Thirty-nine children (50.0%) were found to carry LDLR mutant alleles but none with APOB or PCSK9 mutant alleles. Overall, 27 different LDLR mutations were identified, and 2 were novel. Children carrying mutations showed higher LDL-C (215.2\u2009\u00b1\u200952.7\u2009mg/dL vs 181.0\u2009\u00b1\u200944.6\u2009mg/dL, P\u2009<.001) and apolipoprotein B levels (131.6\u2009\u00b1\u200938.3\u2009mg/dL vs 100.3\u2009\u00b1\u200930.0\u2009mg/dL, P\u2009<.004), compared with noncarriers. A LDL-C of ~190\u2009mg/dL was the optimal value to discriminate children with and without LDLR mutations. When different diagnostic criteria were compared, those proposed by the European Atherosclerosis Society showed a reasonable balance between sensitivity and specificity in the identification of LDLR mutations. In children without mutation, the FH phenotype was not caused by the aggregation of LDL-C raising single-nucleotide polymorphisms.\nCONCLUSIONS: In unselected children with hypercholesterolemia, LDL-C levels >190\u2009mg/dL and a positive family history of hypercholesterolemia appeared to be the most reliable criteria for detecting FH. As 50% of children with suspected FH did not carry FH-causing mutations, genetic testing should be considered.",

Two independent patient cohorts were investigated to define the workflow, turnaround times, feasibility, and reliability of OFA targeted sequencing in clinical application and using archival material. Cohort I consisted of 59 diagnostic clinical samples from the daily routine submitted for molecular testing over a 4-month time period. Cohort II consisted of 39 archival melanoma samples that were up to 15years old. Libraries were prepared from isolated nucleic acids and sequenced on the Ion Torrent PGM sequencer. Sequencing datasets were analyzed using the Ion Reporter software. Genomic alterations were identified and validated by orthogonal conventional assays including pyrosequencing and immunohistochemistry. Sequencing results of both cohorts, including archival formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded material stored up to 15years, were consistent with published variant frequencies. A concordance of 100% between established assays and OFA targeted NGS was observed. The OFA workflow enabled a turnaround of 3\u00bd days. Taken together, OFA was found to be a convenient tool for fast, reliable, broadly applicable and cost-effective targeted NGS of tumor samples in routine diagnostics. Thus, OFA has strong potential to become an important asset for precision oncology.",

        "abstract": "In the context of a child being diagnosed with a genetic condition, reports from both parents and health professionals suggest many genetic health professionals are reluctant to provide carrier testing for unaffected siblings, despite the lack of evidence of harm. We propose that genetic health professionals' understandings of why parents want to have their children tested may contribute to their reluctance to test. We draw on interviews with 17 genetic health professionals, reporting their beliefs about parents' motivations for testing and their intentions to communicate results to their children. Data were analyzed using inductive content analysis. Genetic health professionals reported attributions that contrasted with reasons parents actually report. These disparities fall into two categories: 1) attributing reasons that parents do not themselves report (i.e. for reassurance about their child's health), and 2) not recognizing the reasons that parents actually do report for wanting testing (i.e. to communicate the information to their child). By identifying that genetic health professionals may be misattributing reasons to parents for desiring their child\"s carrier status, they may be missing an opportunity to assist parents to make decisions that are in line with their values and the best interests of the family.",

Performance and outcomes were retrospectively audited over the following two consecutive one year periods, including survey data on medical specialist comfort with mainstreaming and the model.\nRESULTS: Sixty-four women underwent mainstreamed BRCA1/2 testing over the two year post-implementation period with a rate of detection of BRCA1/2 pathogenic variants of 17%. The referral rate for eligible women significantly increased to over 90% (p<0.001). The median time from referral to delivery of genetic testing results was less than five months, with >90% of patients receiving results during first line chemotherapy. Genetic counseling time decreased from 120 to 54min. Cancer specialists were comfortable with the model.\nCONCLUSIONS: The mainstreaming model proved effective, increasing uptake of genetic testing in eligible patients to over 90%; it was efficient for patients, genetic counselors and cancer specialists and acceptable to cancer specialists. It facilitated co-location of genetic and oncology service delivery but separation of clinical responsibility for genetic testing to a specialist genetics service, ensuring accurate and robust patient-centred care.",

Forty-four clinics participated in the survey and account for approximately half of PKU patients currently followed in clinics in the US (Berry et al., 2013).\nRESULTS: The majority of PKU clinics recommended target blood Phe concentrations to be between 120 and 360\u03bcM for all patients; the upper threshold was relaxed by some clinics for adult patients (from 360 to 600\u03bcM) and tightened for patients who are pregnant/planning to become pregnant (to 240\u03bcM). Patient adherence to these recommendations (percentage of patients with blood Phe below the upper recommended threshold) was age-dependent, decreasing from 88% in the 0-4years age group to 33% in adults 30+ years. Patient adherence to recommendations for blood testing frequency followed a similar trend. Higher staffing intensity (specialists per 100 PKU patients) was associated with better patient adherence to clinics' blood Phe concentrations recommendations.\nCONCLUSION: Clinic recommendations of target blood Phe concentrations in the US are now stricter compared to prior years, and largely reflect recent guidelines by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (Vockley et al., 2014). Adherence to recommended Phe concentrations remains suboptimal, especially in older patients. However, despite remaining above the guidelines, actual blood Phe concentrations in adolescents and adults are lower than those reported in the past (Walter et al., 2002; Freehauf et al., 2013). Continued education and support for PKU patients by healthcare professionals, including adequate clinic staffing, are needed to improve adherence. Future research is needed to understand how to improve adherence to reduce the number of patients lost to follow-up, as the findings of this and similar surveys do not address how to keep patients in clinic.",

Genetic testing for familial hypercholesterolemia is becoming both more widely available and cheaper, spurring conversations about its clinical utility.\nSUMMARY: In most countries, familial hypercholesterolemia is underdiagnosed and diagnosed later in life, often after the onset of coronary heart disease (CHD). Familial hypercholesterolemia is undertreated; low goal attainment and additional modifiable risk factors further increase CHD risk. Familial hypercholesterolemia epitomizes the goal of precision medicine to define a subset of individuals with a high risk of morbidity and mortality through genetic diagnosis to manage and treat the risk accordingly. Genetic cascade screening can be used to identify familial hypercholesterolemia patients at a younger age and start timely treatment to prevent CHD. Familial hypercholesterolemia registries are tools for clinical research and improving healthcare planning and patient care. As genotype and phenotype correlations in familial hypercholesterolemia become increasingly understood, this information will likely play a more important role in diagnosis and treatment especially as the cost of genetic testing continues to decline.",

We screened 945 abstracts and identified 21 studies representing the views of 3934 parents. Parents reported largely positive attitudes toward childhood genetic testing across different genetic tests with varying medical utility. Parents perceived a range of advantages and disadvantages of childhood genetic testing. Childhood genetic testing was viewed by most as beneficial. Parents' education level, genetic status, sex and sociodemographic status were associated with reported attitudes. This yielded some conflicting findings, indicating the need for further research. Genetic counseling remains essential to support this population in making well-informed decisions.

Given universal screening includes all patients, irrespective of high risk factors such early age at onset or family history of CRC, it is important to understand perspectives of all patients and not just those at high risk. As part of a study to assess the feasibility and implementation of universal screening, 189 patients newly diagnosed with CRC were surveyed about their interest in screening for LS and communication of results with at-risk family members. Overall, participants responded positively regarding screening for LS, with most wanting to know their genetic risks in general (86%) and risk of hereditary CRC (93%). Prior to receiving screening results, most participants stated they intended to share their screening results with parents (89%), siblings (96%), and children (96%). Of the 28 participants who received a positive LS screening result, 26 (93%) reported sharing their result with at least one first-degree family member. Interest in screening for LS and communication of screening results with family members was not associated with high risk factors. This study indicates that patients are interested in being screened for LS and that sharing information on the risk of LS with at-risk family members is not a significant barrier. These findings provide novel insight into patient perspectives about screening for LS and can guide successful implementation of universal screening programs.",

We evaluated changes in mammography screening interval after the 2009 recommendations.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study of women aged 40-74 years who received 821,052 screening mammograms between 2006 and 2012 using data from the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium. We compared changes in screening intervals and stratified intervals based on whether the mammogram at the end of the interval occurred before or after the 2009 recommendation. Differences in mean interval length by woman-level characteristics were compared using linear regression.\nRESULTS: The mean interval (in months) minimally decreased after the 2009 USPSTF recommendations. Among women aged 40-49 years, the mean interval decreased from 17.2 months to 17.1 months (difference -0.16%, 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.30 to -0.01). Similar small reductions were seen for most age groups. The largest change in interval length in the post-USPSTF period was declines among women with a first-degree family history of breast cancer (difference -0.68%, 95% CI -0.82 to -0.54) or a 5-year breast cancer risk \u22652.5% (difference -0.58%, 95% CI -0.73 to -0.44).\nCONCLUSIONS: The 2009 USPSTF recommendation did not lengthen the average mammography interval among women routinely participating in mammography screening. Future studies should evaluate whether breast cancer screening intervals lengthen toward biennial intervals following new national 2016 breast cancer screening recommendations, particularly among women less than 50 years of age.",

However, conventional approaches based on Sanger sequencing are laborious and expensive. Next-generation sequencing technology has a great impact on investigation of medical genomics and now applied clinical genetics. We provide a protocol based on a pool and capture method followed by high-throughput sequencing, which realizes a rapid, high-quality, high-accuracy and low-cost testing for mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 by using small amounts of input DNA. Custom capture probes were designed for 195\u2009kb regions encompassing the entire BRCA1 and BRCA2. DNA libraries of 96 samples with distinct indices were pooled before hybridizing to the capture probes, which largely reduced labor and cost. The captured library was run on the Illumina MiSeq sequencer. We applied the method to 384 Japanese individuals including 11 patients with breast cancer whose mutation statuses had been determined by standard clinical testing and 373 individuals from a general population. 99.99% of coding exons and their 20\u2009bp flanking regions were covered with a minimum of 20 reads and the average depth was 179.5, supporting confident variant detection. The sequencing method rendered concordant results for 11 patients with breast cancer compared with the standard clinical testing including nine mutations in eight patients. Among 373 individuals from the general population, novel stop gain and frameshift deletion in BRCA2 were identified, which led to truncated protein and were most likely to be pathogenic. The result suggests the importance of a large-scale population-wide screening for carriers of mutations in these genes.",

        "title": "\"I think we've got too many tests!\": Prenatal providers' reflections on ethical and clinical challenges in the practice integration of cell-free DNA screening.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The recent introduction of cell-free DNA-based non-invasive prenatal screening (cfDNA screening) into clinical practice was expected to revolutionize prenatal testing. cfDNA screening for fetal aneuploidy has demonstrated higher test sensitivity and specificity for some conditions than conventional serum screening and can be conducted early in the pregnancy. However, it is not clear whether and how clinical practices are assimilating this new type of testing into their informed consent and counselling processes. Since the introduction of cfDNA screening into practice in 2011, the uptake and scope have increased dramatically. Prenatal care providers are under pressure to stay up to date with rapidly changing cfDNA screening panels, manage increasing patient demands, and keep up with changing test costs, all while attempting to use the technology responsibly and ethically. While clinical literature on cfDNA screening has shown benefits for specific patient populations, it has also identified significant misunderstandings among providers and patients alike about the power of the technology. The unique features of cfDNA screening, in comparison to established prenatal testing technologies, have implications for informed decision-making and genetic counselling that must be addressed to ensure ethical practice.\nOBJECTIVES: This study explored the experiences of prenatal care providers at the forefront of non-invasive genetic screening in the United States to understand how this testing changes the practice of prenatal medicine. We aimed to learn how the experience of providing and offering this testing differs from established prenatal testing methodologies. These differences may necessitate changes to patient education and consent procedures to maintain ethical practice.\nMETHODS: We used the online American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Physician Directory to identify a systematic sample of five prenatal care providers in each U.S. state and the District of Columbia. Beginning with the lowest zip code in each state, we took every fifth name from the directory, excluding providers who were retired, did not currently practice in the state in which they were listed, or were not involved in a prenatal specialty. After repeating this step twice and sending a total of 461 invitations, 37 providers expressed interest in participating, and we completed telephone interviews with 21 providers (4.6%). We developed a semi-structured interview guide including questions about providers' use of and attitudes toward cfDNA screening. A single interviewer conducted and audio-recorded all interviews by telephone, and the interviews lasted approximately 30 minutes each. We collaboratively developed a codebook through an iterative process of transcript review and code application, and a primary coder coded all transcripts.\nRESULTS: Prenatal care providers have varying perspectives on the advantages of cfDNA screening and express a range of concerns regarding the implementation of cfDNA screening in practice. While providers agreed on several advantages of cfDNA, including increased accuracy, earlier return of results, and decreased risk of complications, many expressed concern that there is not enough time to adequately counsel and educate patients on their prenatal screening and testing options. Providers also agreed that demand for cfDNA screening has increased and expressed a desire for more information from professional societies, labs, and publications. Providers disagreed about the healthcare implications and future of cfDNA screening. Some providers anticipated that cfDNA screening would decrease healthcare costs when implemented widely and expressed optimism for expanded cfDNA screening panels. Others were concerned that cfDNA screening would increase costs over time and questioned whether the expansion to include microdeletions could be done ethically.\nCONCLUSIONS: The perspectives and experiences of the providers in this study allow insight into the clinical benefit, burden on prenatal practice, and potential future of cfDNA screening in clinical practice. Given the likelihood that the scope and uptake of cfDNA screening will continue to increase, it is essential to consider how these changes will affect frontline prenatal care providers and, in turn, patients. Providers' requests for additional guidance and data as well as their concerns with the lack of time available to explain screening and testing options indicate significant potential issues with patient care. It is important to ensure that the clinical integration of cfDNA screening is managed responsibly and ethically before it expands further, exacerbating pre-existing issues. As prenatal screening evolves, so should informed consent and the resources available to women making decisions. The field must take steps to maximize the advantages of cfDNA screening and responsibly manage its ethical issues.",

Participants completed a pictorial blood assessment chart (PBAC) with menses.\nRESULTS: The modified Screening Tool was positive in 32% family members, 77% VWD patients, and 19% controls (P < 0.001). Combined with low ferritin, the modified Screening Tool was positive in 66% family members, 92% VWD patients, and 44% controls (P = 0.001).

In the control group, NPV was between 92% and 95% for the modified Screening Tool and also for the modified Screening Tool combined with low ferritin or a positive PBAC.\nCONCLUSION: These data in a racially diverse population suggest the usefulness of a simple, easy to administer modified Screening Tool. In conjunction with ferritin it could be used in a primary care setting to stratify reproductive age women with a family history of VWD for haemostatic evaluation.",

        "title": "An observational study of the impact of genetic testing for pain perception in the clinical management of chronic non-cancer pain.",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Pain levels are a key metric in clinical care. However, the assessment of pain is limited to basic questionnaires and physician interpretation, which yield subjective data. Genetic markers of pain sensitivity, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms in the catechol-O-methyltransferase gene, have been shown to be associated with pain perception and have been used to provide objective information about a patient's pain. The goal of this study was to determine if physician treatment adjustments based on genetic tests of pain perception resulted in improved outcomes for patients.\nMATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective, longitudinal study was conducted with 134 chronic non-cancer pain patients genotyped for pain perception-related catechol-O-methyltransferase haplotypes. Physicians were provided with patients' results and asked to document 1) their assessment of benefit of the genetic test; 2) treatment changes made based on the genetic test; and 3) patient clinical responses to changes implemented.\nRESULTS: Based on genetic testing results, physicians adjusted treatment plans for 40% of patients. When medication changes were made based on genetic testing results, 72% of patients showed improvement in clinical status. When non-pharmacological actions were performed, 69% of physicians felt their patients' clinical status improved. Moreover, physicians believed the genetic test results were consistent with patient pain levels in 85% of cases.\nCONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that providing personalized medicine with genetic information related to pain perception affected physician clinical decision-making for a substantial proportion of patients in this study, and that the availability and utilization of this information was a contributing factor in clinical improvement.",

        "abstract": "Evidence requirements for implementation of precision medicine (PM), whether informed by genomic or clinical data, are not well defined. Evidence requirements are driven by uncertainty and its attendant consequences; these aspects can be quantified by a novel technique in health economics: value of information analysis (VOI). We utilized VOI analysis to compare the evidence levels over time for warfarin dosing based on pharmacogenomic vs. amiodarone-warfarin drug-drug interaction information. The primary outcome was the expected value of perfect information (EVPI), which is an estimate of the upper limit of the societal value of conducting future research. Over the past decade, the EVPI for the pharmacogenomic strategy decreased from $1,550 to $140 vs. $1,220 to $280 per patient for the drug-interaction strategy. Evidence levels thus appear to be higher for pharmacogenomic-guided vs. drug-interaction-guided warfarin dosing. Clinical guidelines and reimbursement policies for warfarin PM could be informed by these findings.",

Mutations were validated by Sanger sequencing and, where possible, segregation analysis was performed.\nRESULTS: We identified 73 interesting variants, of whom 17 were pathogenic and 19 were variants of unknown clinical significance in well-established cancer susceptibility genes. In addition, 37 potentially pathogenic variants in candidate colorectal cancer susceptibility genes were detected.\nCONCLUSION: In conclusion, we found a promising DNA variant in more than 25 % of the patients, which shows that gene panel testing is a more effective method to identify germline variants in CRC patients compared to a single gene approach.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Single gene tests to predict whether cancers respond to specific targeted therapies are performed increasingly often. Advances in sequencing technology, collectively referred to as next generation sequencing (NGS), mean the entire cancer genome or parts of it can now be sequenced at speed with increased depth and sensitivity. However, translation of NGS into routine cancer care has been slow. Healthcare stakeholders are unclear about the clinical utility of NGS and are concerned it could be an expensive addition to cancer diagnostics, rather than an affordable alternative to single gene testing.\nMETHODS AND FINDINGS: We validated a 46-gene hotspot cancer panel assay allowing multiple gene testing from small diagnostic biopsies. From 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2013, solid tumour samples (including non-small-cell lung carcinoma [NSCLC], colorectal carcinoma, and melanoma) were sequenced in the context of the UK National Health Service from 351 consecutively submitted prospective cases for which treating clinicians thought the patient had potential to benefit from more extensive genetic analysis. Following histological assessment, tumour-rich regions of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) sections underwent macrodissection, DNA extraction, NGS, and analysis using a pipeline centred on Torrent Suite software. With a median turnaround time of seven working days, an integrated clinical report was produced indicating the variants detected, including those with potential diagnostic, prognostic, therapeutic, or clinical trial entry implications. Accompanying phenotypic data were collected, and a detailed cost analysis of the panel compared with single gene testing was undertaken to assess affordability for routine patient care. Panel sequencing was successful for 97% (342/351) of tumour samples in the prospective cohort and showed 100% concordance with known mutations (detected using cobas assays). At least one mutation was identified in 87% (296/342) of tumours. A locally actionable mutation (i.e., available targeted treatment or clinical trial) was identified in 122/351 patients (35%). Forty patients received targeted treatment, in 22/40 (55%) cases solely due to use of the panel. Examination of published data on the potential efficacy of targeted therapies showed theoretically actionable mutations (i.e., mutations for which targeted treatment was potentially appropriate) in 66% (71/107) and 39% (41/105) of melanoma and NSCLC patients, respectively. At a cost of \u00a3339 (US$449) per patient, the panel was less expensive locally than performing more than two or three single gene tests. Study limitations include the use of FFPE samples, which do not always provide high-quality DNA, and the use of \"real world\" data: submission of cases for sequencing did not always follow clinical guidelines, meaning that when mutations were detected, patients were not always eligible for targeted treatments on clinical grounds.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that more extensive tumour sequencing can identify mutations that could improve clinical decision-making in routine cancer care, potentially improving patient outcomes, at an affordable level for healthcare providers.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Noninvasive prenatal screening (NIPS) using plasma cell-free DNA has gained tremendous popularity in the clinical assessment of fetal aneuploidy. Most, if not all, of these tests rely on complex and expensive massively parallel sequencing (MPS) techniques, hindering the use of NIPS as a common screening procedure.\nMETHODS: We have developed and optimized an MPS-independent noninvasive genetic test that can rapidly detect fetal aneuploidy at considerably lower costs. We used the high-throughput ligation-dependent probe amplification (HLPA) assay with standard z score statistics to identify the minute copy number change of targeted chromosomal regions. HLPA was modified from multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification to allow quantification of up to 200 genomic loci in a single multiplex PCR. As a proof of principle, we conducted Down syndrome screening in 1182 women with singleton pregnancies [maternal age (SD): 32.7 (4.6)] using whole-genome sequencing-based NIPS and our method.\nRESULTS: Nineteen fetuses with trisomy 21 were detected by both methods and confirmed by karyotyping of amniotic fluid. Overall, our method showed 100.0% sensitivity (19/19) and 99.7% specificity (1076/1079) in trisomy 21 screening, generating a positive predictive value of 86.4% (19/22) and a 7.1% (84/1182) no-call rate.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our technique potentially opens new avenues for the development of inexpensive, yet effective, prenatal aneuploidy tests. The simplicity and accuracy of this method make it a good candidate for clinical implementation as a standard screening procedure.",

We present recruitment of YBCS, identification and recruitment of at-risk relatives, and YBCS willingness to contact their cancer-free, female relatives.\nMETHODS: A random sample of 3,000 YBCS, stratified by race (Black vs. White/Other), was identified through a population-based cancer registry and recruited in a randomized trial designed to increase use of cancer genetic services. Baseline demographic, clinical, and family characteristics, and variables associated with the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) were assessed as predictors of YBCS' willingness to contact at-risk relatives.\nRESULTS: The 883 YBCS (33.2% response rate; 40% Black) who returned a survey had 1,875 at-risk relatives and were willing to contact 1,360 (72.5%). From 853 invited at-risk relatives (up to two relatives per YBCS), 442 responded (51.6% response rate). YBCS with larger families, with a previous diagnosis of depression, and motivated to comply with recommendations from family members were likely to contact a greater number of relatives. Black YBCS were more likely to contact younger relatives and those living further than 50 miles compared to White/Other YBCS.\nCONCLUSION: It is feasible to recruit diverse families at risk for hereditary cancer from a population-based cancer registry. This recruitment approach can be used as a paradigm for harmonizing processes and increasing internal and external validity of large-scale public health genomic initiatives in the era of precision medicine.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Driven by advances in genomic technology and reduction in costs, next-generation sequencing (NGS) is venturing into routine clinical care. The 'real-world' clinical utility of NGS remains to be determined in focal epilepsies, which account for 60% of all epilepsies and for which the importance of genetic factors is just beginning to emerge. We investigated the diagnostic yield and management implications of whole exome sequencing (WES)-based screening of selected genes in the routine care of common focal epilepsies suspected to have a genetic basis.\nMETHODS: We performed WES, followed by targeted analysis of 64 epilepsy genes, on 40 consecutive children and adults enrolled prospectively from routine clinical practice who had MRI-negative focal epilepsy and a family history of febrile seizures or any type of epilepsy in at least one first- or second-degree relative. Exclusion criteria were previous genetic testing, severe intellectual disability and benign focal epilepsies of childhood.\nRESULTS: 5/40 (12.5%) patients had a pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant, detected in SCN1A, DEPDC5, PCDH19, GABRG2 or NPRL2. Identifying a pathogenic SCN1A variant in a patient with drug-resistant epilepsy prompted to halt presurgical investigations due to concern of unfavorable post-surgical outcome. It also led in the same patient to discontinue long-standing carbamazepine therapy (a potentially aggravating drug in epilepsies due to SCN1A mutations), resulting in complete seizure control. Patients with pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants had a younger median age of seizure onset (range) compared to those without [18 months (8 months-18 years) vs 18 years (18 months-70 years), p=0.02].\nSIGNIFICANCE: Our data demonstrate that WES with targeted gene analysis is an effective diagnostic tool for patients with common focal epilepsies in whom a genetic etiology is suspected. It can also influence clinical decision-making, including antiepileptic drug selection and consideration of epilepsy surgery, hence supporting its incorporation in the routine clinical care of this patient group.",

To optimize such weight management interventions, target audiences will need to be engaged in research and implementation efforts. Investigation into approaches that engage these audiences will be required to ensure that genomic information, particularly with respect to genomic influences on endophenotypes like eating behavior, is understood and accepted, and not associated with unintended adverse outcomes. We took steps to characterize healthy individuals' beliefs about genetic influences on eating behavior.\nMETHODS: Data were collected via online survey from 261 participants selected at random from a database.\nRESULTS: Respondents infrequently spontaneously identified eating behavior-related factors as running in families. However, those who perceived themselves as overweight and perceived a family history of overweight were more likely to attribute eating behavior to genetics on closed-ended assessments, \u03b2=0.252, p=0.039. Genetic attributions for eating behaviors were associated with lower confidence in ability to control eating and weight, \u03b2=-0.119, p=0.035.\nCONCLUSIONS: These exploratory findings shed light on beliefs about genetic influences on eating, a behavioral trait (rather than a disease).

Technological developments have triggered a two-fold transition in carrier screening: the expansion from screening one single disorder to many disorders simultaneously, and offering screening universally, regardless of ancestry. This study aims to identify general and population-specific barriers and needs reflected by stakeholders regarding the implementation of carrier screening in a changing landscape.\nMETHODS: Seventeen semi-structured interviews were conducted with Dutch key stakeholders working in the practical and scientific field of carrier screening. The constellation approach was used to categorise barriers and needs into three levels: culture, structure and practice.\nRESULTS: Barriers on a cultural level include: undecidedness about the desirability of carrier screening, and a lack of priority of screening in mainstream healthcare. On a structural level barriers included: need for organisational structures in healthcare for embedding carrier screening, need for guidelines, financial structures, practical tools for overcoming challenges during counselling, and a need for training and education of both professionals and the public. A lack of demand for screening by the public, and a need for a division of responsibilities were barriers on a practical level.\nCONCLUSION: The absence of a collective sense of urgency for genetic carrier screening, a lack of organisational structures, and uncertainty or even disagreement about the responsibilities seem to be important barriers in the implementation of carrier screening. Stakeholders therefore suggest that change agents should be formally acknowledged to strategically plan broadening of current initiatives and attune different stakeholders.",

Current National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) breast and ovarian genetic/familial high risk assessment criteria for further genetic risk evaluation are useful, but lack specificity for reliably excluding patients with low a priori risk.

We compared TNBC to other breast cancers (OBC) by \u03c72 -test and logistic regression. Kaplan-Meier survival curves, up to 31-12-2014, were compared using log-rank test. TNBC risk of mortality overall (OS) and for breast cancer (BCSS) was evaluated through Cox models. Linkage with the Oncogenetics and Cancer Prevention Unit (OCPU) database of the Geneva University Hospitals provided genetic counseling information. TNBC patients (n\u00a0=\u00a0192, 7.4%) were younger, more often born in Africa or Central-South America than OBC, had larger and more advanced tumors. 18% of TNBC patients did not receive chemotherapy.

Participants completed a mailed questionnaire assessing demographics, clinical characteristics, healthcare utilization, psychosocial variables, and provider satisfaction. LS CRC survivors reported lower provider satisfaction scores on three subscales of the Primary Care Assessment Survey: communication (78.14 vs. 83.96; P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), interpersonal treatment (78.58 vs. 85.30; P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), and knowledge of the patient (60.34 vs. 69.86; P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Among LS CRC survivors, predictors for mean communication and trust subscale scores were location of treatment and socioeconomic status. Higher mean depression scores also were associated with trust, while social support predicted higher satisfaction with communication. Sporadic CRC survivor satisfaction is driven largely by age (communication, interpersonal treatment) and patient anxiety (communication), while seeing a provider more often was associated with increased satisfaction with knowledge of the patient. LS CRC survivors reported lower levels of provider satisfaction than sporadic CRC survivors. LS survivors who received care at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, a comprehensive cancer center (CCC), reported higher satisfaction than those receiving care at other institutions. Depressive symptoms and socioeconomic status may impact provider satisfaction ratings. Exploration of other potential predictors of provider satisfaction should be examined in this population. Additionally, further research is needed to examine the potential impact of provider satisfaction on adherence to medical recommendations in LS CRC survivors, particularly those being treated outside of CCCs.",

        "abstract": "Germline mutations in the BRCA tumor suppressor genes account for a substantial proportion of hereditary breast/ovarian cancer. However, this contribution is lower than expected. This underestimation can partly be explained by the BRCA alterations missed by using Sanger sequencing methods. Thus, large genomic rearrangements (LGRs) in BRCA1 and BRCA2 are responsible for 4-28% of all inherited BRCA mutations. In this study, Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) assay was used for detection of large rearrangements of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes in 36 unrelated high-risk breast/ovarian cancer patients negative for BRCA1/2 point mutations. MLPA assay for all exons of both genes and for 1100delC variant of CHEK2 gene were performed. Positive MLPA results were confirmed by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR). Two different rearrangements in the BRCA1 gene were identified consisting of exon 5 deletion and exon 20 duplication. MLPA analysis did not reveal any large genomic rearrangements in BRCA2 gene. Overall BRCA1/2 LGRs prevalence among high-risk Tunisian patients was 5.5%. Quantitative real-time PCR confirmed MPLA findings. Our results suggest the usefulness of screening for LGRs in BRCA genes in the Tunisian population. To avoid false-negative results, we suggest that MLPA should be used in genetic testing programs. These results are important for guidance counseling and clinical management of Tunisian high-risk patients.",

We aimed to demonstrate how this type of analysis can be used in medical decision making to assess whether psychiatrists were influenced in their treatment recommendations by information on the genotype of a patient, despite knowing the patient's response to treatment as measured by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. A patient's genetic information may be used to predict their response to therapy; such information, however, becomes redundant, and should not influence decisions, once a clinician knows the patient's actual response to treatment.\nMETHODS: Sixty-seven psychiatrists were presented with patients' pre- or post-treatment scores on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale for two hypothetical treatments for schizophrenia. Psychiatrists were also informed whether the patient possessed a genotype linked to hyper-responsiveness to one of the treatments, and were asked to recommend one of these two treatments. Attribute nonattendance assessed whether the information on genotype influenced psychiatrists' treatment recommendations.\nRESULTS: Years of experience predicted whether psychiatrists were influenced by the genetic information. Psychiatrists with 1 year or less of experience had a 46% probability of considering genetic information, whereas psychiatrists with at least 15 years of experience had a lower probability (7%).\nCONCLUSIONS: Psychiatrists and other clinicians should be cautious about allowing a patient's genetic information to carry unnecessary weight in their clinical decision making.",

Assessing the value of WGS is complex because WGS provides multiple findings, some of which can be incidental in nature and unrelated to the specific health concerns that motivated the test. In addition, WGS results can include actionable findings (variants considered to be clinically useful and can be acted on), findings for which evidence for best clinical action is not available (variants considered clinically valid but do not meet as high of a standard for clinical usefulness), and findings of unknown significance. We consider three key challenges encountered in designing our national study on the value of WGS-layers of uncertainty, potential downstream consequences with endogenous aspects, and both positive and negative utility associated with testing information-and potential solutions as strategies to address these challenges. We conceptualized the decision to acquire WGS information as a series of sequential choices that are resolved separately. To determine the value of WGS information at the initial decision to undergo WGS, we used contingent valuation questions, and to elicit respondent preferences for reducing risks of health problems and the consequences of taking the steps to reduce these risks, we used a discrete-choice experiment. We conclude by considering the implications for evaluating the value of other complex health technologies that involve multiple forms of uncertainty.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: New payment and care organization approaches, such as those of accountable care organizations (ACOs), are reshaping accountability and shifting risk, as well as decision making, from payers to providers, within the Triple Aim context of health reform. The Triple Aim calls for improving experience of care, improving health of populations, and reducing health care costs.\nOBJECTIVES: To understand how the transition to the ACO model impacts decision making on adoption and use of innovative technologies in the era of accelerating scientific advancement of personalized medicine and other innovations.\nMETHODS: We interviewed representatives from 10 private payers and 6 provider institutions involved in implementing the ACO model (i.e., ACOs) to understand changes, challenges, and facilitators of decision making on medical innovations, including personalized medicine. We used the framework approach of qualitative research for study design and thematic analysis.\nRESULTS: We found that representatives from the participating payer companies and ACOs perceive similar challenges to ACOs' decision making in terms of achieving a balance between the components of the Triple Aim-improving care experience, improving population health, and reducing costs. The challenges include the prevalence of cost over care quality considerations in ACOs' decisions and ACOs' insufficient analytical and technology assessment capacity to evaluate complex innovations such as personalized medicine. Decision-making facilitators included increased competition across ACOs and patients' interest in personalized medicine.\nCONCLUSIONS: As new payment models evolve, payers, ACOs, and other stakeholders should address challenges and leverage opportunities to arm ACOs with robust, consistent, rigorous, and transparent approaches to decision making on medical innovations.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The growth of \"big data\" and the emphasis on patient-centered health care have led to the increasing use of two key technologies: personalized medicine and digital medicine. For these technologies to move into mainstream health care and be reimbursed by insurers, it will be essential to have evidence that their benefits provide reasonable value relative to their costs. These technologies, however, have complex characteristics that present challenges to the assessment of their economic value. Previous studies have identified the challenges for personalized medicine and thus this work informs the more nascent topic of digital medicine.\nOBJECTIVES: To examine the methodological challenges and future opportunities for assessing the economic value of digital medicine, using personalized medicine as a comparison.\nMETHODS: We focused specifically on digital biomarker technologies and multigene tests. We identified similarities in these technologies that can present challenges to economic evaluation: multiple results, results with different types of utilities, secondary findings, downstream impact (including on family members), and interactive effects.\nRESULTS: Using a structured review, we found that there are few economic evaluations of digital biomarker technologies, with limited results.\nCONCLUSIONS: We conclude that more evidence on the effectiveness of digital medicine will be needed but that the experiences with personalized medicine can inform what data will be needed and how such analyses can be conducted. Our study points out the critical need for typologies and terminology for digital medicine technologies that would enable them to be classified in ways that will facilitate research on their effectiveness and value.",

The presence of two UGT1A1 variants (consistent with Gilbert or Crigler-Najjar syndrome) occurred less frequently in neonates (aged \u226428\u00a0days) than older children (aged 1-18\u00a0years) (31.3% in neonates vs. 85.1%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), and among neonates there was no significant difference in mean total bilirubin between those with two UGT1A1 variants and those without (p\u00a0=\u00a00.47). Three novel variants, including c.337T>G (p.Y113D), c.1037C>A (p.A346E), and c.1469A>C (p.D490A) were identified. Among older children, the most common reason for referral was Gilbert syndrome (83.8%) and UGT1A1 genetic analysis confirmed a diagnosis of Gilbert syndrome in 79.0% of those children.\nCONCLUSIONS: Among neonates, a population in which hyperbilirubinemia is common and often of multifactorial etiology, UGT1A1 genetic testing served as a useful clinical tool in ruling in or ruling out inherited hyperbilirubinemia. Here we describe our experience as a reference laboratory in clinical UGT1A1 full gene sequencing. Our results highlight the challenges in predicting the contribution of genetic variation in UGT1A1 to hyperbilirubinemia based on clinical parameters alone, particularly in neonates, and the utility of UGT1A1 full gene sequencing in the evaluation of neonatal and pediatric hyperbilirubinemia.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is most often of autosomal dominant inheritance with incomplete penetrance and variable expression. The main purpose of family screening is to identify relatives with unrecognized HCM and to monitor those at risk for disease, in order to minimize complications and to assess risk of sudden cardiac death. The ESC and ACCF/AHA guidelines on the diagnosis and management of HCM recommend the screening of child relatives from the age of 10-12 years.\nOBJECTIVES: We studied the outcome of clinical screening and genetic testing of child probands and relatives (<18 years of age) from families with HCM and assessed the age-related penetrance of HCM during the follow-up of these young relatives.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty patients from ten families were included between 2004 and 2013, consisting of three probands and 17 first-degree relatives (80% male; median age 10 years). Fourteen child relatives were mutation carriers (70%; median age eight years). Seven (50%) of the 14 mutation carriers were diagnosed with HCM at initial assessment. At-risk child relatives were defined as those with a positive mutation but a negative phenotype at enrollment. After 3.5\u00b10.8 years of follow-up, two of the phenotype-negative mutation carriers developed HCM at 10 and 15 years of age (28% penetrance rate).\nCONCLUSIONS: The penetrance of HCM in phenotype-negative child relatives was 28% after 3.5 years of follow-up. This underlines the need for long-term monitoring of mutation carriers irrespective of the presence of a positive phenotype.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Risk-reducing surgeries are a feasible option for mitigating the risk in individuals with inherited susceptibility to cancer, but are the procedures cost-effective in the current health-care system in Germany? This study compared the health-care costs for bilateral risk-reducing mastectomy (BRRM) and risk-reducing (bilateral) salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) with cancer treatment costs that could potentially be prevented.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: The analysis is based on interdisciplinary consultations with individuals with a high familial risk for breast and ovarian cancer at the University Breast Center for Franconia (Germany) between 2009 and 2013 (370 consultations; 44 patients with BRCA1 mutations and 26 with BRCA2 mutations). Health-care costs for risk-reducing surgeries in BRCA mutation carriers were calculated as reimbursements in the German diagnosis-related groups (DRG) hospital pricing system. These costs for the health-care system were compared with the potential cancer treatment costs that could possibly be prevented by risk-reducing surgeries.\nRESULTS: Long-term health-care costs can be reduced by risk-reducing surgeries after genetic testing in BRCA mutation carriers. The health-care system in Germany would have saved \u20ac 136,295 if BRRM had been performed and \u20ac 791,653 if RRSO had been performed before the development of cancer in only 50% of the 70 mutation carriers seen in our center. Moreover, in patients with combined RRSO and BRRM (without breast reconstruction), one further life-year for a 40-year-old BRCA mutation carrier would cost \u20ac 2,183.\nCONCLUSION: Intensive care, including risk-reducing surgeries in BRCA mutation carriers, is cost-effective from the point of view of the health-care system in Germany.",

Such outcomes have been described as components of \"personal utility,\" a concept that broadly encompasses patient-endorsed benefits, that is operationally defined as non-clinical outcomes. No empirical delineation of these outcomes has been reported.\nAIM: To address this gap, we administered a Delphi survey to adult participants in a National Institute of Health (NIH) clinical exome study to extract the most highly endorsed outcomes constituting personal utility.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty research participants responded to a Delphi survey to rate 35 items identified by a systematic literature review of personal utility.\nRESULTS: Two rounds of ranking resulted in 24 items that represented 14 distinct elements of personal utility. Elements most highly endorsed by participants were: increased self-knowledge, knowledge of \"the condition,\" altruism, and anticipated coping.\nDISCUSSION: Our findings represent the first systematic effort to delineate elements of personal utility that may be used to anticipate participant expectation and inform genetic counseling prior to sequencing. The 24 items reported need to be studied further in additional clinical genome sequencing studies to assess generalizability in other populations.

Despite the important health consequences of resistant hypertension, few studies of resistant hypertension have been conducted. To perform a genome-wide association study for resistant hypertension, we defined and identified cases of resistant hypertension and hypertensives with treated, controlled hypertension among >47,500 adults residing in the US linked to electronic health records (EHRs) and genotyped as part of the electronic MEdical Records & GEnomics (eMERGE) Network. Electronic selection logic using billing codes, laboratory values, text queries, and medication records was used to identify resistant hypertension cases and controls at each site, and a total of 3,006 cases of resistant hypertension and 876 controlled hypertensives were identified among eMERGE Phase I and II sites. After imputation and quality control, a total of 2,530,150 SNPs were tested for an association among 2,830 multi-ethnic cases of resistant hypertension and 876 controlled hypertensives. No test of association was genome-wide significant in the full dataset or in the dataset limited to European American cases (n = 1,719) and controls (n = 708). The most significant finding was CLNK rs13144136 at p = 1.00x10-6 (odds ratio = 0.68; 95% CI = 0.58-0.80) in the full dataset with similar results in the European American only dataset. We also examined whether SNPs known to influence blood pressure or hypertension also influenced resistant hypertension. None was significant after correction for multiple testing.

Here, we present the management of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer(HBOC)in our hospital. HBOC management commences with the selection of appropriate candidates for genetic testing, based on personal and familial characteristics that determine the individual's probability of being a mutation carrier. Pre-test counseling, which is an essential element of genetic counseling, should include discussion of why the test is being offered, how the test results may affect medical management, and the cancer risks associated with the gene mutation. Post-test counseling is also essential; this includes disclosure of the results, discussion of their significance, assessment of their impact on the individual's emotional state, discussion of their impact on the individual's medical management, and how and where the patient will be followed-up. Most women with epithelial ovarian cancer present with advanced-stage high-grade serous carcinoma accompanied by peritoneal dissemination. The absence of reliable early detection methods and the poor prognosis of advanced ovarian cancer have led to the performance of bilateral risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy(RRSO) after the completion of childbearing in these women. We performed RRSO procedures for 40 BRCA1/2 carriers. Occult invasive cancer and intraepithelial cancer were not detected. However, 4 cases(10%)showed p53overexpression, which was considered to be a p53 signature.

These guidelines facilitate decision making and support the delivery of cancer screening service.\nMETHODS: In the first step, a comparative study was performed by using secondary data extracted from the literature review. Three countries (Canada, Australia and United States) were selected from 25 countries that are member in the International Cancer Screening Network (ICSN). The second step of study was qualitative survey. The study was based on the grounded theory approach. Study tool was semi-structured interview. Interviewing involves asking questions and getting answers from participants. 22 expert's perspectives about guidelines of colorectal cancer screening were surveyed.\nRESULTS: Screening program of selected countries was compared. Countries were surveyed by number of risk groups and subgroups, criteria for risk assessment, beginning age, recommendations, screening approaches and intervals. Australia and United States have three risk groups and Canada has two risk groups. Four risk groups were defined in the national guideline, including high risk, increased risk, average and low risk group. The high risk group comprises of 8 subgroups, increased risk group comprises of 3 subgroups and average risk group contain 4 subgroups. Approved clinical criteria for hereditary syndromes and the roadmap of genetic and pathologic survey were designed.\nCONCLUSIONS: Guidelines and pathways have a vital role in the quality improvement of CRC screening program. National guidelines were refined according to the environmental and genetic criteria of colorectal cancer in Iran. These guidelines provide evidence-based recommendations by risk groups. National pathways as a risk assessment tool can evaluate and improve the processes and outcomes of cancer screening in practice.

This study evaluated variation in testing rates, and oncologist and organizational factors associated with variation, in a setting without financial influences on testing.\nMETHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using electronic data and oncologist surveys within Kaiser Permanente Northern California, a large integrated health care system. Analyses included all 2974 test eligible patients from 2013 to 2015, 113 oncologists, and 15 practice groups. Receipt of multigene testing was evaluated with generalized linear mixed models.\nRESULTS: Overall, 39% of eligible patients had multigene testing, but rates varied widely among practice groups, ranging from 24 to 48% after case mix adjustment. This 24% difference among practices was greater than the variation associated with most patient characteristics, including comorbidities and race/ethnicity, and similar to that associated with tumor size. Practice group and oncologist factors were statistically significant contributors to the variation in testing after adjusting for patient factors. Patients were more likely to be tested if they had a female oncologist (aOR 1.60, 95% CI 1.21-2.12) or were in a practice whose chief had a high testing rate (aOR 1.20, 95% CI 1.12-1.29 per 10% increase in the percent tested).\nCONCLUSIONS: Oncologist and leadership practices play a key role in the variation in genomic test use for cancer recurrence risk even in a healthcare system without financial barriers to testing and could be a leverage point for implementing desired practice changes for new genomic advances.",

The objective of this study was to develop an innovative model to assess the effectiveness, cost, and harms of risk stratified colorectal cancer screening.\nMETHODS: We updated a previously validated microsimulation model consisting of three interlinked components: risk assessment, natural history, and screening/treatment modules. We used data from representative national surveys and the literature to create a synthetic population that mimics the family history and genetic profile of the US population. We applied risk stratification based on published risk assessment tools to triage individuals into five risk categories: high, increased, medium, decreased, and low.\nRESULTS: On average, the incremental cost of risk stratified screening for colorectal cancer compared to the current approach at 60% and 80% compliance rates is $18,342 and $23,961 per life year gained. The harms in terms of false positives and perforations are consistently lower for personalized scenarios across all compliance rates. False positives are reduced by more than 47.0% and perforations by at least 9.9%. There is considerable uncertainty in the life years gained, but the reduction in harms remains stable under all scenarios.\nCONCLUSION: A key finding is that risk stratified screening can reduce harms at all levels of compliance. Therefore, selection of screening scenarios should include comprehensive comparisons of mortality, harms from screening, and cost. This study provides guidance for evaluating risk stratified cancer screening and further research is required to identify optimal implementation approaches in the real-world setting.",

        "abstract": "Carrier screening, whether targeted or expanded, allows individuals to consider their range of reproductive options. Ultimately, the goal of genetic screening is to provide individuals with meaningful information that they can use to guide pregnancy planning based on their personal values. Ethnic-specific, panethnic, and expanded carrier screening are acceptable strategies for prepregnancy and prenatal carrier screening. Because all of these are acceptable strategies, each obstetrician-gynecologist or other health care provider or practice should establish a standard approach that is consistently offered to and discussed with each patient, ideally before pregnancy. Carrier screening will not identify all individuals who are at risk of the screened conditions. Patients should be counseled regarding the residual risk with any test result. Screening for any condition is optional and, after counseling, a patient may decline any or all carrier screening. If a patient requests a screening strategy other than the one used by the obstetrician-gynecologist or other health care provider, the requested test should be made available to her after counseling on its limitations, benefits, and alternatives. Expanded carrier screening does not replace previous risk-based screening recommendations. The determination of the appropriate screening approach for any individual patient should be based on the patient's family history and personal values after counseling. Referral to an obstetrician-gynecologist or other health care provider with genetics expertise should be considered for risk assessment, evaluation, and consideration of diagnostic testing as indicated for any patient with a family history of a genetic condition or concern for a genetic diagnosis.",

        "abstract": "Carrier screening is a term used to describe genetic testing that is performed on an individual who does not have any overt phenotype for a genetic disorder but may have one variant allele within a gene(s) associated with a diagnosis. Information about carrier screening should be provided to every pregnant woman. Carrier screening and counseling ideally should be performed before pregnancy because this enables couples to learn about their reproductive risk and consider the most complete range of reproductive options. A patient may decline any or all screening. When an individual is found to be a carrier for a genetic condition, his or her relatives are at risk of carrying the same mutation. The patient should be encouraged to inform his or her relatives of the risk and the availability of carrier screening. If an individual is found to be a carrier for a specific condition, the patient's reproductive partner should be offered testing in order to receive informed genetic counseling about potential reproductive outcomes. If both partners are found to be carriers of a genetic condition, genetic counseling should be offered. What follows is a detailed discussion of some of the more common genetic conditions for which carrier screening is recommended in at least some segments of the population.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Succinate dehydrogenase B (SDHB) associated pheochromocytomas (PHEOs) are associated with a higher risk of tumor aggressiveness and malignancy. The aim of the present study was to evaluate (1) the frequency of germline SDHB mutations in apparently sporadic patients with PHEO who undergo preoperative genetic testing and (2) the ability to predict pathogenic mutations.\nMETHODS: From 2012 to 2016, 82 patients underwent a PHEO surgical resection. Sixteen were operated in the context of hereditary PHEO and were excluded from analysis. Among the 66 remaining cases, 48 were preoperatively screened for an SDHB mutation. In addition to imaging studies with specific radiopharmaceuticals (123I-MIBG or 18F-FDOPA) for exclusion of multifocality/metastases, 36 patients underwent 18F-FDG PET/CT.\nRESULTS: From the 48 genetically screened patients, genetic testing found a germline SDHB variant in two (4.2%) cases: a variant of unknown significance, exon 1, c.14T&gt;G (p.Val5Gly), and a most likely pathogenic mutation, exon 5, c.440A&gt;G (p.Tyr147Cys), according to in silico analysis. Structural and functional analyses of the protein predicted that p.Tyr147Cys mutant was pathogenic. Both tumors exhibited moderate 18F-FDG PET uptake with similar uptake patterns to non-SDHB mutated PHEOs. The two patients underwent total laparoscopic adrenalectomies. Of the remaining patients, 44 underwent a laparoscopic adrenalectomy, and two had an open approach. Pathological analysis of the tumors from patients bearing two germline SDHB variants revealed a typical PHEO (PASS 0 and 2). Ex-vivo analyses (metabolomics, SDHB immunohistochemistry, loss of heterozygosity analysis) allowed a reclassification of the two SDHB variants as probably non-pathogenic variants.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study illustrates that SDHx mutational analysis can be misleading, even if structural and functional analyses are done. Surgeons should be aware of the difficulty of classifying new SDHB variants prior to implementing SDHB mutation status into a tailored surgical management strategy of a patient.",

This study from a tertiary care hospital showed that of the 127 breast cancer patients on treatment during 2014-2015, 24 of them fulfilled the criteria of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome after detailed verbal autopsy and pedigree analysis, and BRCA1 and 2 next-generation sequencing done after pre-test counseling revealed mutations in 13 cases (54%), these included 9 BRCA1 mutations (69%) and 4 BRCA2 mutation (31%). Subsequent post-test counseling recommended targeted mutation analysis for 64 high-risk members in these 13 families with pathogenic mutations, which will help in surveillance for early detection, appropriate management, and prevention of the disease by decreasing the burden to both family and nation. Results from this preliminary study highlight the importance of genetic counseling, pedigree analysis, and genetic testing. It can be recommended that all oncology units should have a genetic counseling service for providing appropriate support to oncologists, patients, and families to prevent unnecessary testing; however, breast cancer screening program is incomplete without evaluating for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome.",

At present, the effects of genetic testing for obesity seem limited to improving consumers' weight control intentions and motivation rather than actual dietary behavior. Evidence for negative psychological consequences is scarce and seems of greater concern for normal weight persons than for those who are overweight.

Available assays make it possible to assess genetic losses, amplifications, translocations, mutations, or the expression levels of specific gene transcripts or proteins. Current molecular diagnostics frequently use a panel-based approach and whole genome analysis, and generally rely either on DNA sequencing or on hybridization-based methodologies, such as those used in cytogenomic microarrays. In some cases, immunohistochemistry can be used as a surrogate for genetic analysis when the mutation of interest consistently results in overexpression or underexpression of a known protein product. In surgical neuropathology practice, the diagnostic workup of diffuse gliomas, medulloblastomas, low-grade circumscribed gliomas, as well as other diseases, now routinely incorporates the results of genomic studies.

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Moffitt Cancer Center's Personalized Medicine Clinical Service (PMCS) reviews somatic next-generation sequencing (NGS) assay results, provides interpretations, and identifies potential therapeutic options. The number of individuals reviewed by our clinical service who are eligible for on-label or off-label drug therapy based on genetic test results has previously not been quantitated. We determined the number of patients harboring an actionable mutation that would qualify a patient for an on-label drug or consideration for off-label drug treatment.\nMETHODS: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Table of Pharmacogenomic Biomarkers in Drug Labeling was utilized to identify anticancer agents containing genomic markers in the Indications and Usage section of the drug label. A database containing discrete NGS patient data was queried retrospectively for those drugs and associated genomic mutations included in this study. On-label was defined as those patients who were eligible for a drug based on harboring a targetable mutation in the FDA-approved cancer type. Off-label was defined as those patients who may be considered for a drug based on harboring a targetable mutation in a non-FDA-approved cancer type.\nRESULTS: A total of 1072 patients and 1131 NGS results were eligible for study inclusion. Fifty-two patients (4.9%) had results for more than one NGS assay. Seventeen drugs targeting ALK, BRAF, BRCA1/BRCA2, EGFR, or ERBB2 mutations met the study inclusion criteria. Of the entire patient population, 92 (8.6%) unique patients were eligible for at least one on-label drug; off-label use of at least one drug could be considered in 103 (9.6%) unique patients.\nCONCLUSION: Combining both on-label and off-label opportunities, 175 (16.3%) unique patients had actionable mutations in six genes. Because most patients reviewed by our PMCS have previously treated advanced disease with limited treatment options, identifying additional lines of therapy is of clinical utility.",

In general, HER2 status is determined by the use of immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Comprehensive genomic sequencing (CGS) enables the detection of gene mutations and copy number alterations including KRAS mutation and HER2 amplification; however, little is known about the utility of CGS for detecting HER2-positive CRC. To assess its utility, we retrospectively investigated 201 patients with stage I-IV CRC. The HER2 status of the primary site was assessed using IHC and FISH, and HER2 amplification of the primary site was also assessed using CGS, and the findings of these approaches were compared in each patient. CGS successfully detected alterations in 415 genes including KRAS codon 12/13 mutation and HER2 amplification. Fifty-nine (29%) patients had a KRAS codon 12/13 mutation. Ten (5%) patients were diagnosed as HER2 positive because of HER2 IHC 3+, and the same 10 (5%) patients had HER2 amplification evaluated using CGS. The results of HER2 status and HER2 amplification were completely identical in all 201 patients (P < .001). Nine of the 10 HER2-positive patients were KRAS 12/13 wild-type and were considered possible candidates for HER2-targeted therapy. CGS has the same utility as IHC and FISH for detecting HER2-positive patients who are candidates for HER2-targeted therapy, and facilitates precision medicine and tailor-made treatment.",

This was achieved through three objectives - 1. identifying an optimal method of presenting risk data, 2. designing and building a risk application, and 3. testing the ability of the application to successfully modify patients perceived risk of cancer.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: A mobile application was developed for this project using best practice methods for displaying risk information. Patients (n\u00a0=\u00a084) were randomly allocated into two groups - 'Control' or 'Treatment'. Both groups underwent standard risk counseling while the application was employed in the 'Treatment' group. The patients were surveyed before their session, immediately after and six weeks later.\nRESULTS: Increases in accuracy were seen in both groups with larger increases demonstrated in the 'Treatment' group with 'Personal 10\u00a0Year Risk' statistically significant ('Control' group increase from 21% to 48% vs the 'Treatment' group increase from 33% to 71% - p\u00a0=\u00a00.003).\nCONCLUSION: This project demonstrated trends towards improved risk perception, however mixed logistic regression was unable to show a 30% difference between groups. Numerical literacy and understanding of risk were identified as issues amongst the general population. Overestimating risk remains high amongst attendees. Using mobile applications to convey risk information to patients is a new and evolving area with a corresponding paucity of data.

The primary objective of this study was to determine potential cost savings of combinatorial PGx testing over the course of 1 year in patients with mental illness treated by primary care providers (PCPs) and psychiatrists who had switched or added a new psychiatric medication after patients failed to respond to monotherapy. The current evaluation details cost savings of treatment decisions congruent and incongruent with the combinatorial PGx test recommendations specific to PCPs and psychiatrists.\nMETHODS: This study was a subanalysis of a 1-year, prospective trial comparing medication costs of 2168 patients undergoing GeneSight testing. Pharmacy claims were provided by a pharmacy benefits manager, comparing medication costs 6 months before combinatorial PGx testing and followed up for 1 year after the testing. This analysis compared congruence and cost savings per patient based on the type of health care provider administering care.\nFINDINGS: Using data from a large pharmacy benefits manager, we found that PCPs treat the majority of mental health patients receiving psychotropic medication prescriptions, including treatment-resistant patients. PCPs congruent with combinatorial PGx testing provided the most medication cost savings for payers and patients at $3988 per member per year (P < 0.001).\nIMPLICATIONS: Health care providers treating patients with mental illness can significantly reduce medication costs by following the combinatorial PGx report recommendations. PCPs, who treat the majority of patients with mental illness, reported a significant reduction in medication costs for both central nervous system and non-central nervous system drugs.",

Nineteen patients were diagnosed with invasive OC/FTC within 1 year of prior screening (13 diagnoses were screen-detected and six were occult at RRSO). No symptomatic interval cancers occurred. Ten (52.6%) of the total 19 diagnoses were stage I to II OC/FTC (CI, 28.9% to 75.6%). Of the 13 screen-detected cancers, five (38.5%) were stage I to II (CI, 13.9% to 68.4%). Of the six occult cancers, five (83.3%) were stage I to II (CI, 35.9% to 99.6%). Modeled sensitivity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for OC/FTC detection within 1 year were 94.7% (CI, 74.0% to 99.9%), 10.8% (6.5% to 16.5%), and 100% (CI, 100% to 100%), respectively. Seven (36.8%) of the 19 cancers diagnosed < 1 year after prior screen were stage IIIb to IV (CI, 16.3% to 61.6%) compared with 17 (94.4%) of 18 cancers diagnosed > 1 year after screening ended (CI, 72.7% to 99.9%; P < .001). Eighteen (94.8%) of 19 cancers diagnosed < 1 year after prior screen had zero residual disease (with lower surgical complexity, P = .16) (CI, 74.0% to 99.9%) compared with 13 (72.2%) of 18 cancers subsequently diagnosed (CI, 46.5% to 90.3%; P = .09). Conclusion ROCA-based screening is an option for women at high risk of OC/FTC who defer or decline RRSO, given its high sensitivity and significant stage shift. However, it remains unknown whether this strategy would improve survival in screened high-risk women.",

Readied catalytic frameworks that foster communication, collaboration, a shared vision, and transformative translational research across scientific and non-scientific divides are needed to foster rapid generation of novel solutions to address and ultimately eliminate disparities. To achieve this, we transformed and expanded a community-academic board into a translational science board with members from public, academic and private sectors. Rooted in team science, diverse board experts formed topic-specific \"accelerators\", tasked with collaborating to rapidly generate new ideas, questions, approaches, and projects comprising patients, advocates, clinicians, researchers, funders, public health and industry leaders. We began with four accelerators-digital health, big data, genomics and environmental health-and were rapidly able to respond to funding opportunities, transform new ideas into clinical and community programs, generate new, accessible, actionable data, and more efficiently and effectively conduct research. This innovative model has the power to maximize research quality and efficiency, improve patient care and engagement, optimize data democratization and dissemination among target populations, contribute to policy, and lead to systems changes needed to address the root causes of disparities.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The frequency of mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency (dMMR) in patients\u00a0< 50 years with adenomas without a known germline mutation is unknown. Our aim was to define the frequency of dMMRs in adenomas from patients aged\u00a0< 50 years.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: We identified all patients aged 18 to 49 years who had undergone colonoscopy at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center from 2008 to 2013 and were identified as having tubular, villous, or tubulovillous adenomas on pathology. Patients with a personal history of colorectal cancer, polyposis syndrome, or inflammatory bowel disease before colonoscopy were excluded. Age, demographic data, family history of cancer, personal history of cancer, use of radiation, reason for colonoscopy, and colonoscopy findings were recorded. Polyps were stained using immunohistochemistry for MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 proteins.\nRESULTS: A total of 208 patients with 266 polyps were identified. Of the 266 polyps, 259 could be stained. Of the 208 patients, 82 (40%) were men; their mean age was 44 years. The indication for colonoscopy was screening for 120, diagnostic for 75, and therapeutic for 15. Of the 259 examined polyps, 246 (95%) were tubular adenomas and 13 were tubulovillous adenomas (5%). One patient (0.4%) was found to have dMMRs in 1 polyp. This patient was a 42-year-old woman with a history of endometrial cancer who had undergone colonoscopy for hematochezia. A 15-mm transverse tubular adenoma was found that was deficient in MLH1 and PMS2.\nCONCLUSION: Our results indicate that routine screening of polyps in patients aged\u00a0< 50 years old is not an effective tool for identifying Lynch syndrome carriers.",

We assessed 5-year BC-specific survival (BCSS) in LN+ patients with RS results in SEER databases.\nMETHODS: In this population-based study, BC cases in SEER registries (diagnosed 2004-2013) were linked to RS results from assays performed by Genomic Health (2004-2014). The primary analysis included only patients (diagnosed 2004-2012) with LN+ (including micrometastases), HR+ (per SEER), and HER2-negative (per RT-PCR) primary invasive BC (N\u00a0=\u00a06768). BCSS, assessed by RS category and number of positive lymph nodes, was calculated using the actuarial method.\nRESULTS: The proportion of patients with RS results and LN+ disease (N\u00a0=\u00a08782) increased over time between 2004 and 2013, and decreased with increasing lymph node involvement from micrometastases to \u22654 lymph nodes. Five-year BCSS outcomes for those with RS\u00a0<\u00a018 ranged from 98.9% (95% CI 97.4-99.6) for those with micrometastases to 92.8% (95% CI 73.4-98.2) for those with \u22654 lymph nodes. Similar patterns were found for patients with RS 18-30 and RS\u00a0\u2265\u00a031. RS group was strongly predictive of BCSS among patients with micrometastases or up to three positive lymph nodes (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).\nCONCLUSIONS: Overall, 5-year BCSS is excellent for patients with RS\u00a0<\u00a018 and micrometastases, one or two positive lymph nodes, and worsens with additionally involved lymph nodes. Further analyses should account for treatment variables, and longitudinal updates will be important to better characterize utilization of Oncotype DX testing and long-term survival outcomes.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the 2nd most common cancer in women worldwide. In Italy, only 50% of people invited to get the Fecal Occult Blood Test (FOBT) decided to do it. Women's participation in breast and cervical screening is, instead, very high (>70%). The aim of our study was to investigate the beliefs, the feelings and the psychological factors that could influence the participation of women in CRC screening.\nMETHODS: We conducted a cross sectional study, in the Hospital of Siena, Central Italy, in 2011. We administered a questionnaire to 507 women of all ages, who attended mammography or clinical breast examination. The adherence to CRC screening was analyzed only in the group of 207 older women (age >50 years). We performed descriptive, bivariate and logistic regression analysis to identify whether an association was present between participant characteristics, willingness and adherence to screening.\nRESULTS: Family history of colorectal cancer (OR 4.3; p<0.007) and the General Practitioner's advice (OR: 3.4; p<0.003) were associated with a greater adherence to screening (colonoscopy). The embarrassment was another factor related to colonoscopy compliance (OR: 0.34; p<0.016).\nCONCLUSION: Family history of CRC, pain or embarassment and GP's advice are the factors that correlated more strongly (positively or negatively) with adherence to colorectal cancer screening. These elements should be further analyzed to choose the best solution to improve the adherence in campaigns on colorectal cancer.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: There is significant morbidity associated with fragile X syndrome. Unfortunately, most maternal carriers are clinically silent during their reproductive years. Because of this, many experts have put forward the notion of preconception or prenatal fragile X carrier screening for females. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of fragile X syndrome pre-mutation and asymptomatic full-mutation carriers in a Chinese pregnant population, and the distribution of cytosine-guanine-guanine (CGG) repeat numbers using a robust fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) polymerase chain reaction assay.\nMETHODS: This was a cross-sectional survey in prospectively recruited pregnant women from a university hospital in Hong Kong. Chinese pregnant women without a family history of fragile X syndrome were recruited between April 2013 and May 2015. A specific FMR1 polymerase chain reaction assay was performed on peripheral blood to determine the CGG repeat number of the FMR1 gene. Prenatal counselling was offered to full-mutation and pre-mutation carriers.\nRESULTS: In 2650 Chinese pregnant women, two individuals with pre-mutation alleles (0.08%, one in 1325) and one asymptomatic woman with full-mutation (0.04%, one in 2650) alleles were identified. The overall prevalence of pre-mutation and full-mutation alleles was 0.11% (1 in 883). Furthermore, 30 (1.1%) individuals with intermediate alleles were detected. In the 2617 women with normal CGG repeats, the most common CGG repeat allele was 30.\nCONCLUSIONS: The overall prevalence of pre-mutation and asymptomatic full-mutation carriers in the Chinese pregnant population was one in 883, detected by a new FMR1 polymerase chain reaction assay.",

        "abstract": "With the advancements in precision medicine and health care reform, it is critical that genetic counseling practice respond to emerging evidence to maximize client benefit. The objective of this review was to synthesize evidence on outcomes from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of genetic counseling to inform clinical practice. Seven databases were searched in conducting this review. Studies were selected for inclusion if they were: (a) RCTs published from 1990 to 2015, and (b) assessed a direct outcome of genetic counseling. Extracted data included study population, aims, and outcomes. Risk of bias was evaluated using the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions guidelines. A review of 1654 abstracts identified 58 publications of 54 unique RCTs that met inclusion criteria, the vast majority of which were conducted in cancer genetic counseling setting. Twenty-seven publications assessed 'enhancements' to genetic counseling, and 31 publications compared delivery modes. The methodological rigor varied considerably, highlighting the need for attention to quality criteria in RCT design. While most studies assessed several client outcomes hypothesized to be affected by genetic counseling (e.g., psychological wellbeing, knowledge, perceived risk, patient satisfaction), disparate validated and reliable scales and other assessments were often used to evaluate the same outcome(s). This limits opportunity to compare findings across studies. While RCTs of genetic counseling demonstrate enhanced client outcomes in a number of studies and pave the way to evidence-based practice, the heterogeneity of the research questions suggest an important need for more complementary studies with consistent outcome assessments.",

        "abstract": "Biomarkers play an essential role in the management of patients with invasive breast cancer. For selecting patients likely to respond to endocrine therapy, both oestrogen receptors (ERs) and progesterone receptors (PRs) should be measured on all newly diagnosed invasive breast cancers. On the other hand, for selecting likely response to all forms of anti-HER2 therapy (trastuzumab, pertuzumab, lapatinib\u00a0or ado-trastuzumab emtansine), determination of HER2 expression or gene copy number is mandatory. Where feasible, measurement of ER, PR and HER2 should be performed on recurrent lesions and the primary invasive tumour. Although methodological problems exist in the determination of Ki67, because of its clearly established clinical value, wide availability and low costs relative to the available multianalyte signatures, Ki67 may be used for determining prognosis, especially if values are low or high. In oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive, HER2-negative, lymph node-negative patients, multianalyte tests such as urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA)-PAI-1, Oncotype DX, MammaPrint, EndoPredict, Breast Cancer Index (BCI) and Prosigna (PAM50) may be used to predict outcome and aid adjunct therapy decision-making. Oncotype DX, MammaPrint, EndoPredict and Prosigna may be similarly used in patients with 1-3 metastatic lymph nodes.

Lynch syndrome is a potential screening target due to its prevalence, penetrance, and the availability of well-established, preventive interventions. However, while population screening may lower incidence of preventable conditions, implementation without evidence may lead to unintentional harms. We examined the literature to determine whether evidence exists that screening for Lynch-associated mismatch repair (MMR) gene mutations leads to improved overall survival, cancer-specific survival, or quality of life. Documenting evidence and gaps is critical to implementing genomic approaches in public health and guiding future research.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Our 2014-2015 systematic review identified studies comparing screening with no screening in the general population, and controlled studies assessing analytic validity of targeted next-generation sequencing, and benefits or harms of interventions or screening. We conducted meta-analyses for the association between early or more frequent colonoscopies and health outcomes.\nRESULTS: Twelve studies met our eligibility criteria. No adequate evidence directly addressed the main question or the harms of screening in the general population. Meta-analyses found relative reductions of 68% for colorectal cancer incidence (relative risk: 0.32, 95% confidence interval: 0.23-0.43, three cohort studies, 590 participants) and 78% for all-cause mortality (relative risk: 0.22, 95% confidence interval: 0.09-0.56, three cohort studies, 590 participants) for early or more frequent colonoscopies among family members of people with cancer who also had an associated MMR gene mutation.\nCONCLUSION: Inadequate evidence exists examining harms and benefits of population-based screening for Lynch syndrome. Lack of evidence highlights the need for data that directly compare benefits and harms.",

Applying a qualitative approach, we asked women to elaborate on the factors they considered in either opting for PGD or discontinuing the screening procedure. Participants were 18 Jewish Israeli women; 14 were carriers of one of the Ashkenazi founder mutations in BRCA1/2, and four were spouses of male mutation carriers, who underwent at least one cycle of PGD. Prior to seeking PGD, ten of the women had no children. At the time of the interview, all but three had at least one child. Three factors emerged as key motivators for PGD: having witnessed the disease in a close relative (n\u00a0=\u00a012); prior IVF treatment for infertility (n\u00a0=\u00a012); and having pre-existing frozen embryos (n\u00a0=\u00a06). Ten women withdrew from the PGD process due to clinical, logistical, and financial reasons. In conclusion, most women decided to withdraw from PGD instead of continuing until a successful conception was achieved. Those who opted for PGD attributed their discontinuation of further screening to the emotional burden that is greatly intensified by practical difficulties.",

We sought to understand the attitudes and perceptions of patients in an institutional implementation project and hypothesized that views would differ on the basis of experience with pharmacogenomic-guided care.\nMETHODS: Two focus groups were conducted - one group included patients who had previously been subjected to broad pharmacogenomic genotyping with results available to physicians (pharmacogenomic group), whereas the other had not been offered genotyping (traditional care). Five domains were explored: (i) experiences with medications/side effects, (ii) understanding of pharmacogenomics, (iii) impact of pharmacogenomics on relationships with healthcare professionals, (iv) scenarios involving pharmacogenomic-guided prescribing, and (v) responses to pharmacogenomic education materials.\nRESULTS: Nine pharmacogenomic and 13 traditional care participants were included. Participants in both groups agreed that pharmacogenomics could inform prescribing and help identify problem prescriptions, but expressed concerns over insurance coverage and employment discrimination. Both groups diverged on who should be permitted to access pharmacogenomic results, with some preferring access only for providers with a longstanding relationship, whereas others argued for open access. Notably, traditional care participants showed greater skepticism about how results might be used. Case scenarios and tested educational materials elicited strong desires on the part of patients for physicians to engage participants when considering pharmacogenomic-based prescribing and to utilize shared decision-making.\nCONCLUSION: Participants experiencing pharmacogenomic-guided care were more receptive toward pharmacogenomic information being used than traditional care participants.

Treatment with nitisinone and dietary restrictions are associated with improved outcomes; some studies suggest better outcomes when treatment begins at an asymptomatic stage. Newborn screening allows for earlier identification, but there is uncertainty regarding the test accuracy of the current method: succinylacetone measurement in dried blood spots using tandem mass spectrometry.\nMETHODS: We conducted a systematic review of literature published up to January 2016. Two reviewers independently assessed titles, abstracts, full texts, and conducted quality appraisals. A single reviewer extracted data, which was checked by a second reviewer.\nRESULTS: Ten studies provided test accuracy data: five studies reporting screening experiences and five case-control studies. Sensitivity (29 cases in total) and specificity (34,403 controls in total) were 100% in the case-control studies, but could not be calculated in the studies reporting screening experiences due to a lack of follow-up of screen-negative babies. Positive predictive values in the screening experience studies ranged from 66.7% (2 true positive cases, 1 false positive case from ~500,000 people screened) to 100% (8 true positive cases from 856,671 people screened); negative predictive values could not be calculated. Positive and negative predictive values cannot be calculated from case-control studies.\nCONCLUSIONS: Screening for Tyrosinemia type 1 using tandem mass spectrometry measurement of succinylacetone from dried blood spots appears to be promising. Confirmation of test accuracy data should be obtained from studies that include a two-year follow-up of individuals who screen negative.",

Because implementation of pharmacogenetics requires collaboration across many disciplines, residents works within an interprofessional team of physicians, nurses, informatics specialists, pharmacists, and clinical laboratory personnel to achieve program goals. Since the first resident graduated in 2012, the program has graduated 1 resident each year. Graduated residents have accepted pharmacogenetics positions at major academic medical centers and community hospitals, as well as academic and research positions with a pharmacogenetics emphasis.\nCONCLUSION: A PGY2 clinical pharmacogenetics residency was successfully developed at St. Jude in 2013. After completion of the program, residents are equipped with the clinical skills and necessary experience to drive precision medicine forward and lead the implementation of pharmacogenetic testing in other healthcare settings.",

        "abstract": "The advances made in genomics and molecular tools aid public health programs in the investigation of outbreaks and control of diseases by taking advantage of the precision medicine. Precision medicine means \"segregating the individuals into subpopulations who vary in their disease susceptibility and response to a precise treatment\" and not merely designing of drugs or creation of medical devices. By 2017, the United Kingdom 100,000 Genomes Project is expected to sequence 100,000 genomes from 70,000 patients. Similarly, the Precision Medicine Initiative of the United States plans to increase population-based genome sequencing and link it with clinical data. A national cohort of around 1 million people is to be established in the long term, to investigate the genetic and environmental determinants of health and disease, and further integrated to their electronic health records that are optional. Precision public health can be seen as administering the right intervention to the needy population at an appropriate time. Precision medicine originates from a wet-lab while evidence-based medicine is nurtured in a clinic. Linking the quintessential basic science research and clinical practice is necessary. In addition, new technologies to employ and analyze data in an integrated and dynamic way are essential for public health and precision medicine. The transition from evidence-based approach in public health to genomic approach to individuals with a paradigm shift of a \"reactive\" medicine to a more \"proactive\" and personalized health care may sound exceptional. However, a population perspective is needed for the precision medicine to succeed.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To explore the psychosocial implications of diagnostic uncertainty that result from inconclusive results generated by newborn bloodspot screening (NBS) for cystic fibrosis (CF).\nSTUDY DESIGN: Using a mixed methods prospective cohort study of children who received NBS for CF, we compared psychosocial outcomes of parents whose children who received persistently inconclusive results with those whose children received true positive or screen-negative results.\nRESULTS: Mothers of infants who received inconclusive results (n\u2009=\u200917), diagnoses of CF (n\u2009=\u200915), and screen-negative results (n\u2009=\u2009411) were surveyed; 23 parent interviews were completed. Compared with mothers of infants with true positive/screen-negative results, mothers of infants with inconclusive results reported greater perceived uncertainty (P\u2009<\u2009.006) but no differences in anxiety or vulnerability (P\u2009>\u2009.05). Qualitatively, parents valued being connected to experts but struggled with the meaning of an uncertain diagnosis, worried about their infant's health-related vulnerability, and had mixed views about surveillance.\nCONCLUSION: Inconclusive CF NBS results were not associated with anxiety or vulnerability but led to health-related uncertainty and qualitative concerns. Findings should be considered alongside efforts to optimize protocols for CF screening and surveillance. Educational and psychosocial supports are warranted for these families.",

Patients completed a baseline questionnaire on family history and were followed every 6 months until death or 5 years after randomization.\nRESULTS: We examined the endpoints of disease-free survival (DFS), time to recurrence (TTR) and overall survival (OS), comparing patients with a positive versus negative family history of colorectal cancer. The adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for patients with a positive family history were 0.95 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.78-1.16] for DFS, 0.94 (95% CI, 0.76-1.16) for TTR, and 0.92 (95% CI, 0.74-1.15) for OS (all adjusted P&gt;0.47). A non-significant trend toward improved DFS (P=0.17; adjusted P=0.34) was observed when 2 or more relatives were affected as compared to 0 relatives (multivariate HR: 0.72; 95% CI, 0.45-1.15), whereas subjects with histories of 0 or 1 affected relatives had similar DFS (multivariate HR for 1 vs. 0: 1.00; 95% CI, 0.81-1.24). Interactions of the molecular factors KRAS, BRAF, and MMR with family history were also explored. The only significant interaction was for deficient MMR (dMMR) and first-degree relatives with a family history of colorectal cancer (0 vs. 1 vs. 2+ relatives) for a benefit on OS (univariate P=0.001), which remained significant after adjusting for other factors (P=0.029).\nCONCLUSIONS: Among patients with stage III resected colon cancer treated with adjuvant FOLFOX, a family history of colorectal cancer did not significantly impact DFS, TTR, or OS outcomes, with the exception of patients with dMMR-expressing tumors.",

Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) have significant potential to inform such attempts. However there is limited understanding of the processes by which this can be achieved. This exploratory study followed attempts to utilise two different PROMs measures to support service quality improvement in clinical genetics. PROMs used were the Genetic Counseling Outcome Scale (GCOS-24), a well-validated clinical genetics-specific PROM and Euroqol (EQ-5D), a generic PROM favoured by the UK National Institute for Health and Excellence (NICE). Both of these PROMs enable pre/post intervention comparison. A service audit tool was also used, premised on a patient-reported experience measure. In addition, the study draws on interviews with clinical staff to identify challenges associated with the use of PROMs (response rate, data collection, analysis). Benefits are also explored and include the provision of insight into patients' needs; complementing clinical judgement; identification of needs being met, evidencing the benefit of services provided; prompting consideration of areas requiring attention; and encouraging professional development.",

Individuals' psychological reactions are influenced by both the content of the received information and the subjective perception of their own risk of becoming ill or being a carrier of a genetic mutation. This study included 120 participants who underwent genetic counselling for breast and/or ovarian cancer. The aim of the study was to examine the relation between their cancer risk perception and the genetic risk during CGO before receiving genetic test results, considering the influence of some psychological variables, in particular distress, anxiety and depression. Participants completed the following tools during a psychological interview: a socio-demographic form, Cancer Risk Perception (CRP) and Genetic Risk Perception (GRP), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and Distress Thermometer (DT). The data seem to confirm our hypothesis. Positive and significant correlations were found between the observed variables. Moreover, genetic risk perception determined an increase in depressive symptomatology and cancer risk perception led to an increase in anxious symptomatology, specifically in participants during cancer treatment. The present results suggest the importance of assessing genetic and cancer risk perception in individuals who undergo CGO, to identify those who are at risk of a decrease in psychological well-being and of developing greater psychological distress.",

        "abstract": "In the last decade, an increasing number of cardiac conditions have been shown to have a genetic basis. Cardiovascular genetic counseling has emerged as a subspecialty aiming to identify unaffected at-risk individuals. An important sector of this at-risk population also includes expectant mothers, in whom unique clinical challenges may arise. Genetic counselors, especially those in cardiovascular and prenatal settings, have an opportunity to identify and assist women who may benefit from cardiovascular care during pregnancy. This paper provides basic management and genetic evaluation principles for affected women, as well as guidance on identifying those who are at risk. We provide considerations for cardiac surveillance in pregnancy and the post-partum period. Finally, key psychosocial issues that appraise how to best provide support to at risk women as they make informed decisions are discussed. We propose that a team approach including cardiology, maternal fetal medicine, and genetic counseling best serves this patient population. Ongoing questions addressing an evidence based approach to cardiovascular genetic conditions in pregnancy still remain. Thus, well-designed research protocols are essential to mark progress in this area.",

Panelists were asked to base their responses to questions both on their clinical expertise and results of a literature review that was forwarded to each panelist. Three rounds of online questionnaires were conducted to identify areas of consensus and strength of that consensus, as well as areas of contention.\nRESULTS: The panel consisted of 13 physicians and five family members. Strong consensus was reached regarding typical clinical presentation of Dravet syndrome, range of electroencephalography and magnetic resonance imaging findings, need for genetic testing, critical information that should be conveyed to families at diagnosis, priorities for seizure control and typical degree of control, seizure triggers and recommendations for avoidance, first- and second-line therapies for seizures, requirement and indications for rescue therapy, specific recommendations for comorbidity screening, and need for family support. Consensus was not as strong regarding later therapies, including vagus nerve stimulation and callosotomy, and for specific therapies of associated comorbidities. Beyond the initial treatment with benzodiazepines and use of valproate, there was no consensus on the optimal in-hospital management of convulsive status epilepticus.\nCONCLUSIONS: We were able to identify areas where there was strong consensus that we hope will (1) inform health care providers on optimal diagnosis and management of patients with Dravet syndrome, (2) support reimbursement from insurance companies for genetic testing and Dravet syndrome-specific therapies, and (3) improve quality of life for patients with Dravet syndrome and their families by avoidance of unnecessary testing and provision of an early accurate diagnosis allowing optimal selection of therapeutic strategies.",

A traditional research and drug development paradigm continues to target heterogeneous late-stage clinically phenotyped patients with single 'magic bullet' drugs. Here, we propose that it is time for a paradigm shift towards the implementation of precision medicine (PM) for enhanced risk screening, detection, treatment, and prevention of AD. The overarching structure of how PM for AD can be achieved will be provided through the convergence of breakthrough technological advances, including big data science, systems biology, genomic sequencing, blood-based biomarkers, integrated disease modeling and P4 medicine. It is hypothesized that deconstructing AD into multiple genetic and biological subsets existing within this heterogeneous target population will provide an effective PM strategy for treating individual patients with the specific agent(s) that are likely to work best based on the specific individual biological make-up. The Alzheimer's Precision Medicine Initiative (APMI) is an international collaboration of leading interdisciplinary clinicians and scientists devoted towards the implementation of PM in Neurology, Psychiatry and Neuroscience. It is hypothesized that successful realization of PM in AD and other neurodegenerative diseases will result in breakthrough therapies, such as in oncology, with optimized safety profiles, better responder rates and treatment responses, particularly through biomarker-guided early preclinical disease-stage clinical trials.",

The first step is a clinical investigation involving: (i) a child psychiatric and psychological evaluation confirming autism diagnosis from different observational sources and assessing autism severity; (ii) a neuropediatric evaluation examining neurological symptoms and developmental milestones; and (iii) a genetic evaluation searching for dysmorphic features and malformations. The second step involves laboratory and if necessary neuroimaging and EEG studies oriented by clinical results based on clinical genetic and neuropediatric examinations.

Gaps in effective communication (where all parties share the same meaning) are widely recognized as a major contributor to health disparities. The purpose of this study was to examine GC-patient communication in real time, to assess its effectiveness from the patient perspective, and then to pilot intervention strategies to improve the communication. We observed 64 English-, 35 Spanish- and 25 Chinese-speaking (n\u00a0=\u00a0124) public hospital patients and 10 GCs in 170 GC appointments, and interviewed 49 patients who were offered testing using the audio recordings to stimulate recall and probe specific aspects of the communication. Data analyses were conducted using grounded theory methods and revealed a fundamental mismatch between the information provided by GCs and the information desired and meaningful to patients. Several components of the communication that contributed to this mismatch and often resulted in ineffective communication included: (1) too much information; (2) complex terminology and conceptually difficult presentation of information; (3) information perceived as not relevant by the patient; (4) unintentional inhibition of patient engagement and question-asking; (5) vague discussions of screening and prevention recommendations. Our findings indicate a need to transform the standard model of genetic counseling communication using evidence-based principles and strategies from other fields of Medicine. The high rates of limited health literacy in the US, increasing access of diverse populations to genetic services, and growing complexity of genetic information have created a perfect storm.

Despite several systematic reviews of RCTs, it is unclear under what circumstances that personalised risk estimates promotes change in four key health-related behaviours: smoking, physical activity, diet and alcohol consumption.\nPURPOSE: The present research aims to systematically identify, evaluate and synthesise the findings of existing systematic reviews.\nMETHODS: This systematic review of systematic reviews followed published guidance. A search of four databases and two-stage screening procedure with good reliability identified nine eligible systematic reviews.\nRESULTS: The nine reviews each included between three and 15 primary studies, containing 36 unique studies. Methods of personalising risk feedback included imaging/visual feedback, genetic testing, and numerical estimation from risk algorithms. The reviews were generally high quality. For a broad range of methods of estimating and communicating risk, the reviews found no evidence that risk information had strong or consistent effects on health-related behaviours. The most promising effects came from interventions using visual or imaging techniques and with smoking cessation and dietary behaviour as outcomes, but with inconsistent results. Few interventions explicitly used theory, few targeted self-efficacy or response efficacy, and a limited range of Behaviour Change Techniques were used.\nCONCLUSIONS: Presenting risk information on its own, even when highly personalised, does not produce strong effects on health-related behaviours or changes which are sustained. Future research in this area should build on the existing knowledge base about increasing the effects of risk communication on behaviour.",

The World Health Organization classifies combined hormonal contraception as an \"unacceptable health risk\" for women with thrombogenic mutations but advises against universal thrombophilia screening before prescribing COCs given the low prevalence of thrombophilia and high screening costs.\nOBJECTIVE: Through the lens of lifetime costs and benefits, this paper systematically and critically reviews all published economic evaluations of thrombophilia screening prior to prescribing COCs.\nMETHODS: We searched relevant databases for economic evaluations of thrombophilia screening before prescribing COCs. After extracting the key study characteristics and economic variables, we evaluated each article using the Quality of Health Economic Studies (QHES) and the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) instruments.\nRESULTS: Seven economic evaluations of thrombophilia screening before prescribing COCs met our inclusion criteria. Only the two economic evaluations focusing exclusively on selective screening exceeded the 75-point threshold for high-quality economic studies based on the QHES instrument, whereas only one of these exceeded the 85% CHEERS threshold. Only three of the seven economic evaluations performed sensitivity analysis on key parameters. Most studies underestimated the benefits of thrombophilia screening by comparing one-time costs of genetic screening against benefits per person-year, thus implicitly assuming a 1-year duration of COC use, neglecting the long-term implications of VTE and/or neglecting the lifetime benefits of awareness of inherited thrombophilia.\nCONCLUSION: Our review highlights the lack of methodologically rigorous economic evaluations of universal thrombophilia screening before prescribing COCs.",

Publicity surrounding celebrity health services use increases awareness of important health issues and demand for health services. We aimed to describe BRCA testing trends before and after Jolie's disclosure, breast cancer-related services use following testing, and test reimbursement trends. MarketScan Commercial Claims data were used to compare trends in BRCA testing before and after Jolie's health disclosure using an interrupted time series model among women aged 18-64. We used modified Poisson regression to estimate risks for health services use (surgical consult, mastectomy, mammography, magnetic resonance imaging, genetic counseling) following BRCA testing. BRCA testing rates increased from 12.5 to 19.0 tests/100,000 women between January 2013 and October 2014. Immediately following Jolie's disclosure, testing increased by approximately 37% (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Although BRCA testing increased, use of post-testing follow-up services declined after Jolie's disclosure. Mean insurance reimbursement and patient out-of-pocket spending on the test decreased by 3 and 36%, respectively. While genetic testing uptake increased following Jolie's disclosure, subsequent health services use associated with BRCA mutations declined, suggesting that celebrity disclosures may be associated with potential genetic testing overuse.",

        "abstract": "Noninvasive prenatal screening using cell-free DNA, which analyzes placental DNA circulating in maternal blood to provide information about fetal chromosomal disorders early in pregnancy and without risk to the fetus, has been hailed as a potential \"paradigm shift\" in prenatal genetic screening. Commercial provision of cell-free DNA screening has contributed to a rapid expansion of the tests included in the screening panels. The tests can include screening for sex chromosome anomalies, rare subchromosomal microdeletions and aneuploidies, and most recently, the entire fetal genome. The benefits of this screening tool are generally framed, by both providers and commercial laboratories, as enhancing reproductive autonomy and choice by providing an earlier, simpler, and more accurate screening while potentially reducing the need for invasive follow-up testing. The majority of the literature has explored these issues empirically or conceptually from a European or North American vantage point, one that assumes normative priorities such as individual reproductive autonomy and the clinical availability of maternal health care or prenatal screening programs within which cell-free DNA screening is offered. While its implementation has raised both challenges and opportunities, very little is known about real-world experiences and the implications of the rapid introduction of cell-free DNA screening outside of North America and Europe, especially in low- and middle-income countries. To begin addressing this gap in knowledge, we organized a four-day international workshop to explore the ethical, legal, social, economic, clinical, and practical implications of the global expansion of cell-free DNA screening.

Screen-positive cases were confirmed using leukocyte enzymatic activity and DNA molecular analysis.\nRESULTS: From July 2012 to April 2016, 20,018 patients were screened; 20 patients were confirmed to have an LSD phenotype (99.9 in 100,000 newborns). Final distributions include 11 Pompe disease, five Fabry disease, two MPS-I, and two Niemann-Pick type A/B patients. We did not find any Gaucher or Krabbe patients. A final frequency of 1 in 1001 LSD newborn phenotypes was established.\nDISCUSSION: NBS is a major public health achievement that has decreased the morbidity and mortality of inborn errors of metabolism. The introduction of NBS for LSD presents new challenges. This is the first multiplex Latin-American study of six LSDs detected through NBS.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Glutaric aciduria type 1 (GA-1) is an organic acidemia with potentially severe neurological sequelae. In Taiwan, newborn screening (NBS) for GA-1 began in 2001, but large-scale reporting is lacking. This study describes Taiwan's largest newborn screening population to date.\nMETHODS: Between 2001 and 2015, 1,490,636 newborns were screened for GA-1. Confirmatory examinations included the carnitine loading test. Confirmed patients were treated with a low lysine diet, carnitine, and high-energy intake during illness. Clinical, laboratory, and neuroimaging data were analyzed.\nRESULTS: Fourteen newborns were diagnosed with GA-1 (incidence: 1/106,474). C5DC concentration was clearly increased after carnitine loading in the affected newborns, but not in false-positive newborns (p\u00a0=\u00a00.004), indicating that this test is useful as an adjuvant diagnostic method. Eleven patients followed in our hospital were enrolled, namely nine NBS patients and two patients diagnosed clinically. IVS10-2A>C was the most common mutation. Two novel mutations (T36fs and N291K) were identified. Pendular nystagmus was found in two pediatric GA-1 patients. The corresponding pathology was optic atrophy in one patient, but remained undetermined in the other patient. The frequency of encephalopathic crisis decreased substantially following NBS. Among patients diagnosed by NBS, cognitive functioning was better among patients with good compliance than patients with poor compliance (p\u00a0=\u00a00.03). Abnormalities were detected by brain MRI including diffusion-weighted imaging and apparent diffusion coefficient maps; these affected various brain regions at different stages of the disease. Basal ganglion injuries occurred after an encephalopathic crisis. White matter disease was prevalent among older patients, either with or without an encephalopathic crisis.\nCONCLUSION: Early diagnosis by newborn screening followed by full compliance with treatment guidelines is important to a good outcome.",

Although initially most genetic tests for health purposes were offered as direct-to-consumer services, that is, without the mediation of a medical professional, currently many commercial providers require that their tests be ordered by a licensed physician. At the same time, some commercially developed health-related genetic tests are gaining support from the professional medical community and are finding their way into clinical practice. Therefore, we differentiated between three types of genetic testing offers: direct-to-consumer, physician-mediated, and clinic-based genetic testing. Expanded carrier screening tests for recessive disorders are currently available through all the three models of genetic testing. Herein, we review the present landscape of expanded carrier screening offers by highlighting the distinct issues associated with each of the three types of genetic testing.",

        "abstract": "Whether children should be offered genetic testing for cancer risk is much debated but young voices are rarely heard in these conversations. The current study explored perspectives of genetic testing held by adolescents and emerging adults in families with Li Fraumeni syndrome (LFS). Twelve 12- to 25-year-olds in families with LFS completed qualitative interviews for this study. All believed that testing should be offered for children but many qualified this statement saying parental approval would be needed and testing should be optional. Genetic testing was seen as way to learn of risk status, allow for disease prevention efforts, and reduce uncertainty and anxiety. Perceived disadvantages included negative emotions associated with the testing result. Participants generally felt that children should be involved in the testing decision, but that parents could unilaterally decide to have a child tested in certain circumstances (e.g., young age, high risk). All who were aware of having been tested and of their test result (n\u00a0=\u00a07; 4 positive) said testing had no negative impact on their outlook and they agreed with the decision to undergo testing. Implications of these findings for clinical practice and future research are discussed.",

Introduced in the field of oncology, it is now considered of major interest in other medical domains like allergy and chronic airway diseases, which face an urgent need to improve the level of disease control, enhance patient satisfaction and increase effectiveness of preventive interventions. The combination of personalized care, prediction of treatment success, prevention of disease and patient participation in the elaboration of the treatment plan is expected to substantially improve the therapeutic approach for individuals suffering from chronic disabling conditions. Given the emerging data on the impact of patient stratification on treatment outcomes, European and American regulatory bodies support the principles of PM and its potential advantage over current treatment strategies. The aim of the current document was to propose a consensus on the position and gradual implementation of the principles of PM within existing adult treatment algorithms for allergic rhinitis (AR) and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). At the time of diagnosis, prediction of success of the initiated treatment and patient participation in the decision of the treatment plan can be implemented. The second-level approach ideally involves strategies to prevent progression of disease, in addition to prediction of success of therapy, and patient participation in the long-term therapeutic strategy. Endotype-driven treatment is part of a personalized approach and should be positioned at the tertiary level of care, given the efforts needed for its implementation and the high cost of molecular diagnosis and biological treatment.",

The authors evaluated the effect on outcomes for patients diagnosed with neuropsychiatric disorders of pharmacogenetics (PGx)-guided treatment compared to usual standard of care.\nMETHODS: This was a prospective, randomized study of 237 patients at an outpatient community-based psychiatric practice conducted between April 2015 and October 2015. Baseline patient assessments and a buccal swab were collected for pharmacogenetic testing at study initiation. For the experimental group, PGx results were provided to the clinicians as guides to treatment. Control subjects were treated according to the usual standard of care with no clinician reference to their PGx results. Neuropsychiatric Questionnaire (NPQ) and Symbol Digit Coding Test (SDC) scores and adverse drug events, hospitalizations, and medication information were collected at 30, 60, and 90 days.\nRESULTS: More than half (53%) of patients in the control group reported at least 1 adverse drug event compared to 28% of patients with PGx-guided medication management (P = .001). NPQ and SDC scores improved for both groups, but no statistical difference in efficacy as measured by these assessments was observed within the 90-day observation period.\nCONCLUSIONS: Pharmacogenetic testing may facilitate psychiatric drug therapy with greater tolerability and similar efficacy compared to standard of care.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02411123\u200b\u200b.",

        "abstract": "Genomic carrier screening can identify more disease-associated variants than existing carrier screening methodologies, but its utility from patients' perspective is not yet established. A randomized controlled trial for preconception genomic carrier screening provided an opportunity to understand patients' decisions about whether to accept or decline testing. We administered a survey to potential genomic carrier screening recipients who declined participation (N\u00a0=\u00a0240) to evaluate their reasons for doing so. Two thirds of women declined participation. We identified major themes describing reasons these individuals declined to participate; the most common were time limitation, lack of interest, not wanting to know the information, and potential cause of worry or anxiety. Most women eligible for genomic carrier screening indicated that their reasons for opting out were due to logistical issues rather than opposing the rationale for testing. As expanded carrier screening and genomic sequencing become a more routine part of clinical care, it is anticipated there will be variable uptake from individuals for this testing. Thus, the advancement of clinical carrier screening from single genes, to expanded screening panels, to an exome- or genome-wide platform, will require approaches that respect individual choice to receive genetic testing for reproductive risk assessment.",

The specifications for variant files were initially developed to be flexible with regard to content representation to support a variety of research applications. This flexibility permits variation with regard to how sequence findings are described and this depends, in part, on the conventions used. For clinical laboratory testing, this poses a problem because these differences can compromise the capability to compare sequence findings among laboratories to confirm results and to query databases to identify clinically relevant variants. To provide for a more consistent representation of sequence findings described within variant files, the workgroup made several recommendations that considered alignment to a common reference sequence, variant caller settings, use of genomic coordinates, and gene and variant naming conventions. These recommendations were considered with regard to the existing variant file specifications presently used in the clinical setting. Adoption of these recommendations is anticipated to reduce the potential for ambiguity in describing sequence findings and facilitate the sharing of genomic data among clinical laboratories and other entities.",

        "abstract": "It is known that survival is unaffected by the choice of surgical management for breast cancer (BC) patients. Despite this fact, recent literature reveals that the number of bilateral mastectomies (BMs) in the United States is increasing. In an effort to elucidate potential factors influencing this trend, we investigated socioeconomic and clinicopathologic characteristics of our patient cohort that could have affected a patient's decision between unilateral mastectomy (UM) versus BM. Five-hundred-eight patients with unilateral BC who underwent mastectomy between 2000 and 2009 were analyzed: 397-UM; 111-BM. Influence of patient's age, insurance status, residence (rural versus urban), subsequent reconstruction, marital status, smoking history, family cancer history, cancer stage and grade on the BM versus UM patient's decision were analyzed using independent sample t tests, \u03c72 and logistic regression analysis. BM was more likely to be chosen by younger (<50 years) patients (P < 0.001); patients with private insurance [odds ratio (OR) = 2.22, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.4-3.5]; residence in urban settings (OR = 5.09, 95% CI = 2.5-10.4); and plans for subsequent reconstruction (OR = 2.31, 95% CI = 1.4-3.8). Marital status, smoking history, family cancer history, BC stage and grade did not significantly impact patient's choice of BM versus UM. We found that patients with unilateral BC who are younger (<50 year) have private insurance, reside in urban settings, or plan for subsequent reconstruction are more likely to undergo BM for unilateral BC.

Diagnosis is often delayed, resulting in missed crucial diagnostic and therapeutic opportunities.\nOBJECTIVES: This study sought to determine if whole-exome sequencing (WES) as part of a potential NBS program could be used to diagnose TS.\nDESIGN, SETTING, PATIENTS: Karyotype, chromosomal microarray, and WES were performed on blood samples from women with TS (n = 27) enrolled in the Personalized Genomic Research study at the National Institutes of Health. Female control subjects (n = 37) and male subjects (n = 27) also underwent WES. Copy number variation was evaluated using EXCAVATOR2 and B allele frequency was calculated from informative single nucleotide polymorphisms. Simulated WES data were generated for detection of low-level mosaicism and complex structural chromosome abnormalities.\nRESULTS: We detected monosomy for chromosome X in all 27 TS samples, including 1 mosaic for 45,X/46,XX and another with previously unreported material on chromosome Y. Sensitivity and specificity were both 100% for the diagnosis of TS with no false-positive or false-negative results. Using simulated WES data, we detected isochromosome Xq and low-level mosaicism as low as 5%.\nCONCLUSION: We present an accurate method of diagnosing TS using WES, including cases with low-level mosaicism, isochromosome Xq, and cryptic Y-chromosome material. Given the potential use of next-generation sequencing for NBS in many different diseases and syndromes, we propose WES can be used as a screening test for TS in newborns.",

We created Breast Screening Decisions (BSD), a personalized, web-based decision aid, to help women decide when to start and how often to have routine screening mammograms. We evaluated BSD in a large, prospective pilot trial of women and their clinicians.\nMETHODS: Women ages 40-49 were invited to use BSD before a scheduled preventive care visit. One month post-visit, users were asked about decisional conflict, knowledge, perceptions and worry about breast cancer and screening. They were also asked whether they had a screening mammogram since their visit, scheduled an appointment for a screening mammogram, or if they were planning to schedule an appointment within the next six months. Women who responded \"no\" to each of these successive questions were considered to have no plan for a screening mammogram within the next 6\u00a0months, unless they explicitly stated that they were unsure about screening mammography. Clinicians were surveyed regarding mammography discussions and perceived patient knowledge and anxiety.\nRESULTS: Of 1,100 women invited to use BSD, 253 accessed the website, and 168 were eligible to participate in the pilot study. One-fifth had a family history of breast cancer, and at least 76% had any prior mammogram. At follow-up, 88% of BSD users reported discussing mammography at their visit, and 77% said they had a screening mammogram since the visit or that they made or were planning to make a screening mammogram appointment. The average decisional conflict score was 22.5, within the threshold for implementing decisions. Decisional conflict scores were lowest in women who said that they had or planned to have a mammogram (mean 21.4, 95% CI 18.3-24.6), higher in those who did not (mean 24.8, 95% CI 19.2-30.5), and highest in those who were unsure (mean 31.5, 95% CI 13.9-49.1). Most BSD users expressed accurate perceptions of their breast cancer risk and the benefits and limitations of screening.\nCONCLUSIONS: A web-based decision aid may support informed, individualized decisions about screening mammography and facilitate discussions about screening between women in their 40s and their clinicians.",

Effective translation will require ongoing efforts in a number of areas including: selection of appropriate patients, provision of effective consent, pre- and post-test genetic counselling, improving variant interpretation algorithms and practices, and management of secondary findings including those found incidentally and those actively sought. Allied to this is the need for an effective education programme for all members of clinical teams involved in care of patients with rare disease, as well as to maintain public confidence in the use of these technologies. We established a Genomic Medicine Multidisciplinary Team (GM-MDT) in 2014 to build on the experiences of earlier successful research-based WES/WGS studies, to address these needs and to review results including pertinent and secondary findings. Here we report on a qualitative study of decision-making in the GM-MDT combined with analysis of semi-structured interviews with GM-MDT members. Study findings show that members appreciate the clinical and scientific diversity of the GM-MDT and value it for education and oversight. To date, discussions have focussed on case selection including the extent and interpretation of clinical and family history information required to establish likely monogenic aetiology and inheritance model.

        "abstract": "Realizing the benefits of translating psychiatric genomics research into mental health care is not straightforward. The translation process gives rise to ethical challenges that are distinctive from challenges posed within psychiatric genomics research itself, or that form part of the delivery of clinical psychiatric genetics services. This article outlines and considers three distinct ethical concerns posed by the process of translating genomic research into frontline psychiatric practice and policy making. First, the genetic essentialism that is commonly associated with the genomics revolution in health care might inadvertently exacerbate stigma towards people with mental disorders. Secondly, the promises of genomic medicine advance a narrative of individual empowerment. This narrative could promote a fatalism towards patients' biology in ways that function in practice to undermine patients' agency and autonomy, or, alternatively, a heightened sense of subjective genetic responsibility could become embedded within mental health services that leads to psychosocial therapeutic approaches and the clinician-patient therapeutic alliance being undermined. Finally, adopting a genomics-focused approach to public mental health risks shifting attention away from the complex causal relationships between inequitable socio-economic, political, and cultural structures and negative mental health outcomes. The article concludes by outlining a number of potential pathways for future ethics research that emphasizes the importance of examining appropriate translation mechanisms, the complementarity between genetic and psychosocial models of mental disorder, the implications of genomic information for the clinician-patient relationship, and funding priorities and resource allocation decision making in mental health.",

In this analysis, tests were considered useful if a positive result established (or helped to establish) this cause of death or a negative result excluded a cause of death that was suspected based on the clinical history or other results.\nRESULTS: The usefulness of each test was as follows: placental pathology 64.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] 57.9-72.0), fetal autopsy 42.4% (95% CI 36.9-48.4), genetic testing 11.9% (95% CI 9.1-15.3), testing for antiphospholipid antibodies 11.1% (95% CI 8.4-14.4), fetal-maternal hemorrhage 6.4% (95% CI 4.4-9.1), glucose screen 1.6% (95% CI 0.7-3.1), parvovirus 0.4% (95% CI 0.0-1.4), and syphilis 0.2% (95% CI 0.0-1.1). The utility of the tests varied by clinical presentation, suggesting a customized approach for each patient.\nCONCLUSION: The most useful tests were placental pathology and fetal autopsy followed by genetic testing and testing for antiphospholipid antibodies.",

        "abstract": "Given the increasing availability and complexity of genetic testing, it is imperative that the practicing obstetrician-gynecologist or other health care provider has a firm comprehension of the benefits, limitations, and risks of offering a specific genetic test, as well as the importance of appropriate pretest and posttest counseling. The purpose of this Committee Opinion is to provide an outline of how obstetrician-gynecologists and other health care providers can best incorporate these tests into their current practices and provide appropriate pretest and posttest counseling to patients. Obstetrician-gynecologists and other health care providers should determine which tests will be offered as the standard in their practices so that similar testing strategies are made available to all patients. Practices should have procedures in place that ensure timely disclosure of test results to patients. As with any medical test, expectations regarding the performance of a genetic test should be discussed with the patient before the test is ordered. After counseling, patients should have the option to decline any or all testing. Pretest and posttest counseling should be done in a clear, objective, and nondirective fashion, which allows patients sufficient time to understand information and make informed decisions regarding testing and further evaluation or treatment. In addition to counseling each patient about her own personal risk, obstetrician-gynecologists and other health care providers should counsel patients regarding the risk for family members, including their potential to have affected offspring.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Implementation of novel genetic diagnostic tests is generally driven by technological advances because they promise shorter turnaround times and/or higher diagnostic yields. Other aspects, including impact on clinical management or cost-effectiveness, are often not assessed in detail prior to implementation.\nMETHODS: We studied the clinical utility of whole-exome sequencing (WES) in complex pediatric neurology in terms of diagnostic yield and costs. We analyzed 150 patients (and their parents) presenting with complex neurological disorders of suspected genetic origin. In a parallel study, all patients received both the standard diagnostic workup (e.g., cerebral imaging, muscle biopsies or lumbar punctures, and sequential gene-by-gene-based testing) and WES simultaneously.\nRESULTS: Our unique study design allowed direct comparison of diagnostic yield of both trajectories and provided insight into the economic implications of implementing WES in this diagnostic trajectory. We showed that WES identified significantly more conclusive diagnoses (29.3%) than the standard care pathway (7.3%) without incurring higher costs. Exploratory analysis of WES as a first-tier diagnostic test indicates that WES may even be cost-saving, depending on the extent of other tests being omitted.\nCONCLUSION: Our data support such a use of WES in pediatric neurology for disorders of presumed genetic origin.Genet Med advance online publication 23 March 2017.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A patient's medical history and familial cancer history are important information for assessing the risk of hereditary cancer. We have generated a self-administered questionnaire for patients with gynecologic cancer. This pilot study analyzed the usefulness of this questionnaire and the rates of patients that meet the Society of Gynecologic Oncology criteria in ovarian cancer and endometrial cancer patients.\nMETHOD: Ovarian or endometrial cancer patients were recruited for this study. After informed consent was obtained, participants completed the questionnaire. Genetic risks were assessed from the data of each patient's questionnaire by Society of Gynecologic Oncology guideline. Clinical and pathological findings were compared between the genetic risk groups.\nRESULTS: A total of 105 patients were identified with ovarian cancer and 56 patients with endometrial cancer eligible for this study. According to the Society of Gynecologic Oncology guideline, of the 105 ovarian cancer patients, 25 patients (23%) had a 20-25% risk and three patients (2.9%) had a 5-10% risk of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome. A further 22 patients (21%) had a 5-10% risk of Lynch syndrome. Two patients (1.9%) met the Amsterdam criteria II. Of 56 endometrial cancer patients, 24 patients (42.9%) had a 5-10% risk of Lynch syndrome. The endometrial cancer patients with genetic risk of Lynch syndrome were younger (mean age: 47.79) at diagnosis compared to patients without a genetic risk of Lynch syndrome (mean age: 57.91).\nCONCLUSIONS: In this study, we were able to show that the newly designed questionnaire is a useful tool for evaluating cancer family history along with Society of Gynecologic Oncology criteria or Amsterdam criteria II. When considering the risk of Lynch syndrome for a patient with ovarian cancer, it is important to collect a second and third relative's family history.",

        "abstract": "The aim of this study was to assess attitudes toward ovarian cancer risk management options for BRCA mutation carriers in healthy Italian women, and to identify predictors of the preference for risk reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) over surveillance. One hundred eighty-one women aged 30-45 completed a questionnaire about preferences, knowledge, risk perception, and socio-demographic information. Participants were randomly presented with a pamphlet about BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation-specific testing, consequences of testing and preventive options for carriers, and they were stratified by having children or not and by age group. Surveillance was the preferred option (64.6%), followed by RRSO (24.3%). Although RRSO is the only effective strategy available to BRCA carriers, most healthy women faced for the first time with this option may not consider it as their preferred choice. Predictors associated with a higher likelihood to prefer surgery over surveillance were: knowing that life expectancy is longer with surgery, perceived comprehension of the consequences of testing, previous knowledge about BRCA testing, anticipated worry about developing cancer, and feelings of risk. Childbearing intentions and the effect of childbearing intentions on choice were associated with a lower preference for surgery. Further research is needed to confirm the role of the factors identified in this study in order to promote informed decision-making about RRSO.",

Tasks involved hypothetical clinical situations requiring interpretation of pharmacogenomics information to determine optimal prescribing for specific patients.\nRESULTS: Pharmacists were better able to perform certain tasks using the redesigned resource relative to the Pharmacogenomic Knowledgebase (PharmGKB) and the FDA Table of Pharmacogenomic Biomarkers in Drug Labeling. On average, participants completed tasks in 107.5\u2009s using our resource, compared to 188.9\u2009s using PharmGKB and 240.2\u2009s using the FDA table. Using the System Usability Scale, participants rated our resource 79.62 on average, compared to 53.27 for PharmGKB and 50.77 for the FDA table. Participants found the correct answers for 100% of tasks using our resource, compared to 76.9% using PharmGKB and 69.2% using the FDA table.\nDISCUSSION: We present structured, clinically relevant pharmacogenomic FDA drug product label information with visualizations to help explain the relationships between gene variants, drugs, and phenotypes. The results from our evaluation suggest that user-centered interfaces for pharmacogenomics information can increase ease of access and comprehension.\nCONCLUSION: A clinician-focused pharmacogenomics information resource can answer pharmacogenomics-related medication questions faster, more correctly, and more easily than widely used alternatives, as perceived by pharmacists.",

FD is underdiagnosed or even misdiagnosed in patients undergoing kidney transplantation. We initiated a selective screening study for FD among kidney transplant patients in our center. In this study, 1095 male and female patients were included. Dried blood samples on Guthrie papers were used to analyze galactosidase A enzyme for male patients. Genetic analyses were performed in all female and male patients with low enzyme activity. In total, 648 female and 447 male patients with functioning grafts were evaluated. Among 1095 patients, 5 male patients had AGALA activity below threshold and 3 female patients had galactosidase alpha gene DNA variations. One male patient had a disease-causing mutation. The other 4 patients had polymorphisms causing low enzyme activity. All the 3 female patients had mutations that were associated with FD according to Human Gene Mutation Database (ID: CM025441). In contrast, these mutations were reported as unknown clinical significance in Clinvar (rs149391489). The patients with clinical findings suggesting FD were planned to be analyzed for Lyso Gb3. In our selective screening study, 8 variations were found among 1095 kidney transplantation patients, which needs further investigation to determine causes of FD. Clinical findings, physical examination, and family history are also necessary to evaluate the genetic changes as a mutation in this selected population.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: To assess the clinical usefulness of genetic testing in a pediatric population with inherited retinal disease (IRD).\nDESIGN: Single-center retrospective case series.\nPARTICIPANTS: Eighty-five unrelated children with a diagnosis of isolated or syndromic IRD who were referred for clinical genetic testing between January 2014 and July\u00a02016.\nMETHODS: Participants underwent a detailed ophthalmic examination, accompanied by electrodiagnostic testing (EDT) and dysmorphologic assessment where appropriate. Ocular and extraocular features were recorded using Human Phenotype Ontology terms. Subsequently, multigene panel testing (105 or 177 IRD-associated genes) was performed in an accredited diagnostic laboratory, followed by clinical variant interpretation.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Diagnostic yield and clinical usefulness of genetic testing.\nRESULTS: Overall, 78.8% of patients (n\u00a0= 67) received a probable molecular diagnosis; 7.5% (n\u00a0= 5) of these had autosomal dominant disease, 25.4% (n\u00a0= 17) had X-linked disease, and 67.2% (n\u00a0= 45) had autosomal recessive disease. In a further 5.9% of patients (n\u00a0= 5), a single heterozygous ABCA4 variant was identified; all these participants had a spectrum of clinical features consistent with ABCA4 retinopathy. Most participants (84.7%; n\u00a0= 72) had undergone EDT and 81.9% (n\u00a0= 59) of these patients received a probable molecular diagnosis. The genes most frequently mutated in the present cohort were CACNA1F and ABCA4, accounting for 14.9% (n\u00a0= 10) and 11.9% (n\u00a0= 8) of diagnoses respectively. Notably, in many cases, genetic testing helped to distinguish stationary from progressive IRD subtypes and to establish a precise diagnosis in a timely fashion.\nCONCLUSIONS: Multigene panel testing pointed to a molecular diagnosis in 84.7% of children with IRD. The\u00a0diagnostic yield in the study population was significantly higher compared with that in previously reported unselected IRD cohorts. Approaches similar to the one described herein are expected to become a standard component of care in pediatric ophthalmology. We propose the introduction of genetic testing early in the diagnostic pathway in children with clinical and/or electrophysiologic findings, suggestive of\u00a0IRD.",

There are over 65,000 people estimated to have FH in Australia, but many remain undiagnosed. Patients with FH are often under-treated, but with early detection, cascade family testing and adequate treatment, patient outcomes can improve. Patient registries are key tools for providing new information on FH and enhancing care worldwide. The development and design of the FH Australasia Network Registry is a crucial component in the comprehensive model of care for FH, which aims to provide a standardized, high-quality and cost-effective system of care that is likely to have the highest impact on patient outcomes. Informed by stakeholder engagement, the FH Australasia Network Registry was collaboratively developed by government, patient and clinical networks and research groups. The open-source, web-based Rare Disease Registry Framework was the architecture chosen for this registry owing to its open-source standards, modular design, interoperability, scalability and security features; all these are key components required to meet the ever changing clinical demands across regions.

We conducted a randomized controlled trial on 199 patients with chronic disease each receiving eight personalized and actionable complex disease reports online. Primary study aims were to assess the impact of in-person genomic counseling on 1) causal attribution of disease risk, 2) personal awareness of disease risk, and 3) perceived risk of developing a particular disease. Of 98 intervention arm participants (mean age\u00a0=\u00a057.8; 39% female) randomized for in-person genomic counseling, 76 (78%) were seen. In contrast, control arm participants (n\u00a0=\u00a0101; mean age\u00a0=\u00a058.5; 54% female) were initially not offered genomic counseling as part of the study protocol but were able to access in-person genomic counseling, if they requested it, 3-months post viewing of at least one test report and post-completion of the study-specific follow-up survey. A total of 64 intervention arm and 59 control arm participants completed follow-up survey measures. We found that participants receiving in-person genomic counseling had enhanced objective understanding of the genetic variant risk contribution for multiple complex diseases. Genomic counseling was associated with lowered participant causal beliefs in genetic influence across all eight diseases, compared to control participants. Our findings also illustrate that for the majority of diseases under study, intervention arm participants believed they knew their genetic risk status better than control arm subjects. Disease risk was modified for the majority during genomic counseling, due to the assessment of more comprehensive family history. In conclusion, for patients receiving personalized and actionable genomic results through a web portal, genomic counseling enhanced their objective understanding of the genetic variant risk contribution to multiple common diseases. These results support the development of additional genomic counseling interventions to ensure a high level of patient comprehension and improve patient-centered health outcomes.",

        "title": "Primary Carnitine Deficiency",
        "abstract": "CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Primary carnitine deficiency (PCD) is a disorder of the carnitine cycle that results in defective fatty acid oxidation. If untreated, it encompasses a broad clinical spectrum including: (1) metabolic decompensation in infancy typically presenting between age three months and two years with episodes of hypoketotic hypoglycemia, poor feeding, irritability, lethargy, hepatomegaly, elevated liver transaminases, and hyperammonemia triggered by fasting or common illnesses such as upper respiratory tract infection or gastroenteritis; (2) childhood myopathy involving heart and skeletal muscle with onset between age two and four years; (3) pregnancy-related decreased stamina or exacerbation of cardiac arrhythmia; (4) fatigability in adulthood; and (5) absence of symptoms. The latter two categories often include mothers diagnosed with PCD after newborn screening has identified low carnitine levels in their infants.\nDIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of PCD is established in a proband with consistent biochemical analyte findings and/or suggestive clinical and laboratory features by identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in SLC22A5 on molecular genetic testing. In individuals with suspected PCD and negative molecular testing, a carnitine transport assay using cultured skin fibroblasts may be available.\nMANAGEMENT: Targeted therapy: Metabolic decompensation and skeletal and cardiac muscle function improve with 100-200 mg/kg/day oral levocarnitine if it is started before irreversible organ damage occurs. Supportive care: Routine treatment includes preventing hypoglycemia with frequent feeding and avoidance of prolonged fasting; notifying designated metabolic center in advance of scheduled surgical or medical procedures; hospitalization for intravenous glucose administration for individuals who are required to fast for a procedure or who cannot tolerate oral intake due to illness such as gastroenteritis; implementing transitional care plan prior to adulthood. Emergency outpatient treatment includes levocarnitine and carbohydrate supplementation, antipyretics for fever, and antiemetics for occasional vomiting. Acute inpatient treatment includes high-calorie fluids, insulin as needed, intravenous or oral levocarnitine (100-200 mg/kg/day), evaluation of muscle and liver involvement by measuring serum creatine kinase concentration and liver transaminases, and evaluation by cardiologist with EKG and echocardiogram for cardiomyopathy. Surveillance: Monitor plasma carnitine concentration frequently until levels reach normal range; once levels reach normal range, measure three times a year during infancy and early childhood, twice a year in older children, and annually in adults. Assess growth and development at each visit throughout childhood. Neuropsychological testing and quality of life assessment as needed. EKG and echocardiogram annually during childhood and less frequently in adulthood. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Fasting longer than age-appropriate periods; catabolic illness; inadequate calorie provision during other stressors. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Evaluation of all sibs of any age by molecular genetic testing if the SLC22A5 pathogenic variants in the family are known or measurement of plasma-free carnitine concentration to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from institution of treatment and preventive measures. Pregnancy management: Pregnant women with PCD require close monitoring of plasma carnitine levels and increased carnitine supplementation as needed to maintain plasma carnitine levels in the normal range.\nGENETIC COUNSELING: PCD is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for an SLC22A5 pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Once the SLC22A5 pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, molecular genetic carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal/preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

Land-use change and drainage has severely damaged or annihilated these services in many parts of North America and Europe; restoration plans are urgently needed at the landscape level. We review the major constraints on the restoration of rich fens and fen water bodies in agricultural areas in Europe and disturbed landscapes in North America: (i) habitat quality problems: drought, eutrophication, acidification, and toxicity, and (ii) recolonization problems: species pools, ecosystem fragmentation and connectivity, genetic variability, and invasive species; and here provide possible solutions. We discuss both positive and negative consequences of restoration measures, and their causes. The restoration of wetland ecosystem functioning and services has, for a long time, been based on a trial-and-error approach. By presenting research and practice on the restoration of rich fen ecosystems within agricultural areas, we demonstrate the importance of biogeochemical and ecological knowledge at different spatial scales for the management and restoration of biodiversity, water quality, carbon sequestration and other ecosystem services, especially in a changing climate. We define target processes that enable scientists, nature managers, water managers and policy makers to choose between different measures and to predict restoration prospects for different types of deteriorated fens and their starting conditions.",

Major advances in cancer control will be greatly aided by early detection for the diagnosis and treatment of cancer in its pre-invasive state. Cancer being a diverse disease involves alterations in three classes of genes viz. (proto) oncogenes, tumour suppressor genes and DNA repair genes offering a wide variety of opportunities for the development of biomarkers. The emergence of innovative technologies in genomics, proteomics, metabolomics and imaging allows researchers to facilitate inclusive analysis of cancer cells. These approaches have already demonstrated its power to discriminate cancer cells from normal cells and to identify specific genetic elements involved in cancer progression. Cancer evolves via manifold pathways and is a culmination of a variety of genetic, molecular and clinical events. In the past few years, several reports have led to identification of novel cancer signatures via high throughput biology. Current review gives an overview of the bioinformatics tools, cancer database and available software package tools and further summarizes about different strategies involved in Omics research (genomics, proteomics, metabolomics) for the development of cancer biomarkers. We also discuss about the current and emerging biomarkers in breast cancer with fundamental insight into different markers used in breast cancer detection. In addition, we focus upon the systematic integration of various omic data for accelerating cancer biomarker discovery with evidence based cancer management. The above strategies may lead to significant improvement in cancer screening, prognosis and management of therapeutic response in cancer patients.",

        "abstract": "The hourglass model of development postulates divergence in early and late embryo development bridged by a period of developmental constraint at mid-embryogenesis. Recently, molecular support for the hourglass model of development has accumulated, with the emphasis on studies using zebrafish and Drosophila species. Across mammals, the hourglass model and specifically divergence in early development has thus far received little attention. Divergence in mammalian pre-implantation development is particularly interesting because of its potential impact on derivation of pluripotent embryonic stem cells. Here, we review recent findings that support the hourglass model of development. We provide striking examples of variation in key events in mammalian peri-implantation development and their potential consequences for pluripotency of embryonic stem cell lines, including mechanisms of cell signalling and differentiation, gene regulatory networks, X-chromosome inactivation, and epigenetic regulation. The variation in these processes indicates divergence in early mammalian development as was postulated by the hourglass model of development. We discuss the naive and primed states of pluripotency in light of this developmental divergence and their implications for human pluripotent stem cell states.",

        "abstract": "We found that congenital uterine anomalies have a negative impact on reproductive outcome in recurrent-miscarriage couples, being associated with further miscarriage with a normal embryonic karyotype. There has been no study comparing live birth rates between patients with and without surgery. We conducted a prospective study to prove that surgery for a bicornuate or septate uterus might improve the live birth rate. A total of 170 patients with congenital uterine anomalies suffering two or more miscarriages were examined. The live birth rate after ascertainment of anomalies, cumulative live birth rate and infertility rate, were compared between patients with and without surgery. In patients with a septate uterus, the live birth rate (81.3%) at the first pregnancy after ascertainment of anomalies with surgery tended to be higher than that (61.5%) in those without surgery. The infertility rates were similar in both groups, while the cumulative live birth rate (76.1%) tended to be higher than without surgery (60.0%). Surgery showed no benefit in patients with a bicornuate uterus for having a baby, but tended to decrease the preterm birth rate and the low birth weight. The possibility that surgery has benefits for having a baby in patients with a septate uterus suffering recurrent miscarriage could not be excluded.",

Since it is possible that the balance of oxidants and antioxidants can be affected by different genetic variants, gene polymorphisms have been proposed as a susceptibility factor that increases the chance of miscarriage. Manganese superoxide dismutase is an important antioxidant enzyme encoded by manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) gene. The aim of this experiment was to assess whether Val16Ala polymorphism of MnSOD gene is associated with miscarriage in northern Iran. Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) was used for genotyping. Statistical analyses were conducted using the \u03c7(2)-test. The genetic distributions did not differ significantly between cases and controls, however slightly more Val/Val genotypes were found among the patients compared with control subjects (p = 0.059). No correlation was observed between susceptibility to abortion and MnSOD Val16Ala polymorphism. Larger population-based studies are needed for clarifying the relationship between abortion and MnSOD genotypes.",

PATH assisted WRA in designing an approach to measure the short- and long-term results of WRA's advocacy efforts.Expert rating instruments have been widely used since 1970s to track country-level program efforts focusing on family planning, maternal and neonatal health, and HIV/AIDS. This article assesses and establishes the strength and applicability of an expert rating tool, the Maternal Health Policy Score (MHPS), in measuring and guiding a non-profit's advocacy efforts.The tool was assessed using five criteria: validity of results, reproducibility of results, acceptability to respondents, internal consistency and cost. The tool proved effective for measuring improvements in the policy environment at both the national and subnational levels that the non-profit intended to effect and useful for identifying strong and weak policy domains. The results are reproducible, though ensuring fidelity in implementation during different rounds of data collection may be difficult. The acceptability of the tool was high among respondents, and also among users of the information.MHPS provides a quick, low-cost method to measure overall changes in the policy environment, giving advocacy organizations and grant makers timely information to gauge the influence of their work and take corrective action. WRA demonstrated the use of MHPS at multiple points in the project: at the onset of a project to identify and strategize around policy domains that need attention, during and at the end of the project to monitor progress made and redirect efforts.",

For Australia and France, obesity causality was a combination of individual and environmental factors, but for Switzerland, it was predominantly individual. The primary solutions for all countries were health promotion strategies and children's education. Industry groups proposed more school education while health advocates advised government intervention. Where France emphasized cultural attitudes towards taste, Australia focused on sport. The French were most keen on legislating against unhealthy foods compared with Switzerland where there was opposition towards regulation of individual's choices.

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: In the absence of a known affected family member, frequent symptoms of Gaucher disease (GD), a rare lysosomal storage disorder, such as thrombocytopenia or splenomegaly, often lead to hematological diagnostic workup.\nOBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to compare the clinical utility of aspiration biopsy of the bone marrow (ASP) with trephine biopsy (TB) for the diagnosis of GD type 1 (GD1).\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: Six non-Jewish patients with sporadic GD1 were initially examined with ASP and TB to establish the cause of cytopenia and splenomegaly. In the current study, samples from each patient consisted of 2 bone marrow slides. On each slide, 500 nucleated cells were counted and then averaged. The composition of bone marrow TBs was assessed using digital images analyzed on a computer.\nRESULTS: Of 6 patients, 5 carried at least 1 N370S allele with a c.1226A>G mutation in the GBA1 gene. The median number of Gaucher cells identified during cytological assessment of bone marrow smears was 4 (range, 1-18), and the median percentage of Gaucher cells was 0.4% (range, 0.1%-1.8%). The absolute proportion of Gaucher cells in histological samples ranged from 22% to 36% (median value, 28%), and the ratio of Gaucher cell infiltrate to hematopoietic tissue ranged from 34% to 54% (median value, 47%). The median value of the ratio of Gaucher cells to hematopoietic tissue was strikingly lower when using ASP compared with TB (P = 0.028).\nCONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that ASP is not a reliable diagnostic tool for the detection of GD1. Thus, patients with unclear long-lasting splenomegaly and/or thrombocytopenia, in whom bone marrow aspirate cytology is negative for Gaucher cells, should be routinely referred for an enzymatic assay for GD.",

We measured cycloplegic refraction, corneal curvature, intraocular pressure, axial length, body height, and weight. Questionnaires about the children's daily lifestyles, family members' myopia and parents' socio-demographic status were completed. The children were followed up every 6 months in a 3-year period.\nSTATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Bivariate correlations, simple and multiple regression.\nRESULTS: Eighty-eight children participated in this study. Forty-eight were myopic at the beginning of the study, and their myopia correlated with longer axial length and parental myopia (P = 0.015, 0.012). Sixty-five children (74%) completed the study, and the rates of change per year were -0.43 \u00b1 0.58 (mean + standard deviation) diopters in spherical equivalence, 0.32 \u00b1 0.25 mm in axial length (AL), 5.73 \u00b1 2.71 cm in body height, and 3.84 \u00b1 2.23 kg in weight. The axial length change was positively correlated with the height change (P < 0.001). The myopia shift was correlated to axial length change (P = 0.000) but not correlated to height change. Using multiple regression test, near work was the only significant risk factor for myopia progression (P = 0.022).\nCONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that body height increment was correlated to axial length elongation but not to myopia shift in children aged 7-9 years. Genetic factors such as parental myopia and body height had a possible influence on myopia development, and the environment factor as near work intensity was related to myopia progression.",

All pregnant women with a singleton pregnancy who were not diabetic, had no family history of diabetes, had no history of previous GDM, were of white race and non-smokers were enrolled. Total testosterone and DHEA-S were measured at 11-14\u2009weeks of gestation. The patients were called for routine pregnancy visits and followed accordingly. Forty-two patients did not come to their visits and were excluded. During gestational weeks 24-28, the remaining 408 patients were screened for GDM. The total testosterone and DHEA-S levels were compared between patients with and without GDM. Regression and receiver-operator curve analysis were performed.\nRESULTS: GDM developed in 22 women (5.7%). Compared with women without GDM, first trimester total testosterone levels were higher among women in whom GDM subsequently developed. The DHEA-S level did not differ. Age, total testosterone and body mass index were found to be independent predictors of GDM development. A total testosterone value of 0.45\u2009ng/mL was found to predict development of GDM with a sensitivity of 63.6% and a specificity of 62.7%.\nCONCLUSION: First trimester total testosterone has a low testing power for GDM screening with low sensitivity and specificity values and cannot be used as a marker alone.

The genetic testing industry is passing through a period of profound structural change in response to shifts in technology and in the legal environment. Making genetic testing safe and effective for consumers increasingly requires access to comprehensive genomic data infrastructures that can support accurate, state-of-the-art interpretation of genetic test results. At present, there are significant barriers to access and there is no sector-specific regulator with power to ensure appropriate data access. Without it, genetic testing will not be safe for consumers even when it is performed at CLIA-certified laboratories using tests that have been FDA-cleared or approved. This article explores the emerging structure of the genetic testing industry and describes its present economic regulatory vacuum. In view of this gap in regulation, the article explores whether generally applicable law, particularly antitrust law, may offer solutions to the industry's data access problems. It concludes that courts may have a useful role to play, particularly in Europe and other jurisdictions where the essential facilities doctrine enjoys continued vitality. After Verizon Communications v. Law Offices of Curtis V. Trinko, the role of U.S. federal courts is less certain. Congress has demonstrated willingness to address access issues as they emerged in other infrastructure industries in recent decades. This article expresses no preference between legislative and judicial solutions. Its aim is simply to highlight an emerging economic regulatory issue which, if left unresolved, presents real health and safety concerns for consumers who receive genetic tests.",

        "abstract": "Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is defined as carbohydrate intolerance that begins or is first recognized during pregnancy. The prevalence of GDM is highly variable, depending on the population studied, and reflects the underlying pattern of diabetes in the population. GDM manifests by the second half of pregnancy and disappears following delivery in most cases, but is associated with the risk of subsequent diabetes development. Normal pregnancy induces carbohydrate intolerance to favor the availability of nutrients for the fetus, which is compensated by increased insulin secretion from the maternal pancreas. Pregnancy shares similarities with adiposity in metabolism to save energy, and both conditions favor the development of insulin resistance (IR) and low-grade inflammation. A highly complicated network of modified regulatory mechanisms may primarily affect carbohydrate metabolism by promoting autoimmune reactions to pancreatic \u03b2 cells and affecting insulin function. As a result, diabetes development during pregnancy is facilitated. Depending on a pregnant woman's genetic susceptibility to diabetes, autoimmune mechanisms or IR are fundamental to the development autoimmune or non-autoimmune GDM, respectively. Pregnancy may facilitate the identification of women at risk of developing diabetes later in life; autoimmune and non-autoimmune GDM may be early markers of the risk of future type 1 and type 2 diabetes, respectively. The most convenient and efficient way to discriminate GDM types is to assess pancreatic \u03b2-cell autoantibodies along with diagnosing diabetes in pregnancy.",

However, little is known about factors that maintain PTSD symptoms.\nMETHODS: This study is part of the Akershus Birth Cohort. Questionnaire data from pregnancy week 17, 8 weeks postpartum and 2 years postpartum were used. 1473 women completed all these three questionnaires and were included in the analyses. Post-traumatic stress symptoms were measured with the Impact of Event Scale. Potential maintaining factors were personality, sleep, support and life events. The factors that were significantly correlated with post-traumatic stress symptoms were entered into regression analyses. Mediation analyses were run to test whether significant predictors would serve as mediator of post-traumatic stress symptoms at 8 weeks postpartum to post-traumatic stress symptoms at 2 years postpartum.\nRESULTS: We found several low to moderate associations between maintaining factors and PTSD symptoms two years postpartum. Adjusting for the starting point - PTSD symptoms 8 weeks postpartum - only insomnia remained significantly associated. Further, insomnia mediated a small portion of the effect of PTSD symptoms 8 weeks postpartum to PTSD symptoms 2 years postpartum.\nLIMITATIONS: Limitations of the study include a relative homogeneous sample, modest effect sizes, low internal consistency of some of the measures and the challenge to distinguish insomnia from PTSD symptoms.\nCONCLUSIONS: Treatment of postpartum PTSD might benefit from addressing insomnia if present.

However, analytical processes such as the centralization step may profoundly affect CGH array results and therefore may adversely affect outcomes in the precision medicine context.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: The effect of three different centralization methods: median, maximum peak, alternative peak, were evaluated on three datasets: (i) the NCI60 cell lines panel, (ii) the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) panel, and (iii) the patients enrolled in prospective molecular screening trials (SAFIR-01 n = 283, MOSCATO-01 n = 309), and compared with karyotyping, drug sensitivity, and patient-drug matching, respectively.\nRESULTS: Using the NCI60 cell lines panel, the profiles generated by the alternative peak method were significantly closer to the cell karyotypes than those generated by the other centralization strategies (P < 0.05). Using the CCLE dataset, selected genes (ERBB2, EGFR) were better or equally correlated to the IC50 of their companion drug (lapatinib, erlotinib), when applying the alternative centralization. Finally, focusing on 24 actionable genes, we observed as many as 7.1% (SAFIR-01) and 6.8% (MOSCATO-01) of patients originally not oriented to a specific treatment, but who could have been proposed a treatment based on the alternative peak centralization method.\nCONCLUSION: The centralization method substantially affects the call detection of CGH profiles and may thus impact precision medicine approaches.

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: We present formulation and stability evaluation of a 2% (w/v) phenylephrine hydrochloride biocompatible eye drop solution, routinely prepared in hospital pharmacy under aseptic conditions, for retinal examination of neonates and premature infants.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Eye drop solution was formulated by dissolution of phenylephrine hydrochloride and disodium hydrogen phosphate as buffering agent in sterile water for injection and sodium chloride for injection as isotonic agent. The previous solution was sterile filtered through under aseptic conditions, in an iso class 5 air quality clean room under horizontal laminar airflow hood. Physical stability (visual inspection, osmolality measurements), chemical stability (pH measurement, phenylephrine assay by liquid chromatography coupled with an ultra-high resolution and accurate mass) and sterility evaluation of phenylephrine eye drop solution stored at ambient temperature were studied during 60 days.\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The formulated eye drop solution had a pH of 6.90\u00b10.05 and an osmolality of 285\u00b12 mOsm/kg. Throughout the 60 days study the solutions remained clear without any precipitation or color modification, sterility was maintained, pH and osmolality were not significantly modified and no significant loss of product was detected using liquid chromatography coupled with an ultra-high resolution and accurate mass instrument suggesting the lack of degradation.\nCONCLUSION: These results indicate that 2% phenylephrine hydrochloride eye drop solutions were physically, chemically and microbiologically stable for at least 60 days when stored in type I amber glass vials at room temperature, allowing the compounding of higher batch sizes.",

The mean RNFL thickness, total retinal thickness (TRT) at a superior and inferior edge of the disc and the quadrant wise topography of increased RNFL were compared in all three groups. Sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AROC) were calculated for all the parameters.\nRESULTS: The median RNFL thickness was 185.4 (129.5-349.3 \u03bcm), 122.3 (109-156.3 \u03bcm) and 91.62 \u00b1 7 \u03bcm in papilledema, pseudopapilledema, and controls, respectively. Papilledema group had thicker PPRNFL in all quadrants except temporal quadrant. TRT was thicker in papilledema and pseudopapilledema compared to controls. ONHD could be directly visualized as high reflective clumps in the sub-retinal space or the RNFL in 30 eyes. Increased RNFL thickness in all four quadrants was noted 43.3% in papilledema and 9.7% in pseudopapilledema. Normal RNFL thickness in all four quadrants was noted in 0% in papilledema and 32.3% in pseudopapilledema. Nasal RNFL had the highest AROC (0.792) indicating high diagnostic ability to differentiate papilledema from pseudopapilledema.\nCONCLUSION: SD-OCT can be used as a tool to differentiate between papilledema and pseudopapilledema.",

        "abstract": "Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) is the most aggressive solid tumour known and is a rare but highly lethal form of thyroid cancer that requires a multidisciplinary team approach. No Spanish consensus exists for management of patients with ATC. The Thyroid Cancer Group of the Spanish Society of Endocrinology and Nutrition and the GETHI (Grupo Espa\u00f1ol de Enfermedades Hu\u00e9rfanas e Infrecuentes) of the Spanish Society of Oncology, in agreement with the Boards of these Societies, commissioned an independent task force to develop a wide consensus on ATC. The relevant literature was reviewed, including serial PubMed searches supplemented with additional articles. The consensus includes the characteristics, diagnosis, initial evaluation, establishment of treatment goals, approaches to locoregional disease (surgery, radiotherapy, systemic therapy, supportive care during active treatment), approaches to advanced/metastatic disease, palliative care options, monitoring, and long-term follow-up of ATC. For operable disease, a combination of radical surgery with adjuvant radiotherapy or chemotherapy, using agents such as doxorubicin, cisplatin and paclitaxel, is the best treatment strategy. Cytotoxic drugs are poorly effective for advanced/metastatic ATC. On the other hand, targeted agents may represent a viable therapeutic option. Patients with stage IVA/IVB resectable disease have the best prognosis, particularly if a multimodal approach is used, and some stage IVB unresectable patients may respond to aggressive therapy. Patients with stage IVC disease should be considered for clinical trials or for hospice/palliative care depending on their preference. This is the first Spanish consensus for ATC, and provides recommendations for management of this extremely aggressive malignancy. Novel systemic therapies are being tested, and more effective combinations are needed to improve patient outcomes. Although more aggressive radiotherapy has reduced locoregional recurrence, mean overall survival has not improved in the past 50 years.",

        "abstract": "Monoamine oxidase types A and B (MAO-A, MAO-B) regulate the levels of monoamine neurotransmitters in the brain, and their dysfunction may be involved in the pathogenesis and influence the clinical phenotypes of neuropsychiatric disorders. Reversible MAO-A inhibitors, such as moclobemide and befloxatone, are currently employed in the treatment of emotional disorders by inhibiting the enzymatic degradation of dopamine, serotonin and norepinephrine in the central nervous system (CNS). It has been suggested that the irreversible MAO-B inhibitors selegiline and rasagiline exert a neuroprotective effect in Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. This effect, however, is not related to their inhibition of MAO activity; in animal and cellular models, selegiline and rasagiline protect neuronal cells through their anti-apoptotic activity and induction of pro-survival genes. There is increasing evidence that MAO-A activity, but not that of MAO-B, is implicated in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative disorders, but also in gene induction by MAO-B inhibitors; on the other hand, selegiline and rasagiline increase MAO-A mRNA, protein, and enzyme activity levels. Taken together, these results suggest that each MAO subtype exerts effects that modulate the expression and activity of the other isoenzyme. The roles of MAO-A and -B in the CNS should therefore be re-evaluated with respect to the \"type-specificity\" of their inhibitors, which may not be unconditional during chronic treatment. Mao-a expression, in particular, may be implicated in pathogenesis and phenotypes in neuropsychiatric disorders. MAO-A expression is modified by mao polymorphisms affecting its transcriptional efficiency, as well as by mutations and polymorphism of parkin, Sirt1, FOXO, microRNA, presenilin-1, and other regulatory proteins. In addition, childhood maltreatment has been shown to have an impact upon adolescent social behavior in children with mao-a polymorphisms of low transcriptional activity. Low MAO-A activity may increase the levels of serotonin and norepinephrine, resulting in disturbed neurotransmitter system development and behavior. This review discusses genetic and environmental factors involved in the regulation of MAO-A expression, in the contexts of neuropsychiatric function and of the regulation of neuronal survival and death.",

Newborns with low TREC values were subjected to complete blood cell counts and flow cytometry.\nRESULTS: A total of 106,391 newborns were screened using the TREC assay over a period of 19 months. Five newborns were immediately referred for confirmatory tests, including two SCID patients and two patients with persistent T-cell lymphopenia; a third SCID patient was found 2 months after the study period. All three SCID cases received stem cell transplantation at the age of 2-5 months. We also identified five cases of 22q11.2 microdeletion syndrome. During this period, two SCID patients from among the unscreened newborns were reported, and they died at ages 3 months and 4 months, respectively.\nCONCLUSION: Newborn screening to measure the number of TREC copies successfully identifies newborns with T-cell lymphopenia, 22q11.2 microdeletion syndrome, and other high-risk conditions. Taken together, the incidence of T-cell lymphopenia in apparently healthy newborns is more than 1 in 11,821, and further attention to their immune functions is warranted.",

Parental haplotypes were constructed using target-region sequencing data from the parents and the probands. Fetal haplotypes were constructed using a hidden Markov model through maternal plasma DNA sequencing. The presence of haplotypes linked to the maternal mutant alleles in males indicated affected fetuses. This method was further validated by comparing the inferred single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotypes to the direct sequencing results of fetal genomic DNA. Prenatal diagnosis was confirmed with amniocentesis, and those results were interpreted in a blinded fashion.\nRESULTS: The results showed an average accuracy of 99.98% for the total inferred maternal SNPs. With a mean depth of 30\u00d7 achieved in the 10-Mb target region of each sample, the noninvasive results were consistent with those of the invasive procedure.\nCONCLUSION: This is the first report of NIPT for DMD and the first application of a haplotype-based approach in NIPT for X-linked diseases.

Noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT), first trimester maternal serum markers, and fetal nuchal translucency are the most recently developed screening tests added to the testing repertoire for detection of chromosomal disorders such as trisomy 21 (Down syndrome). NIPT is a new, highly accurate technique that uses maternal serum and is rapidly being introduced as a first trimester screening tool and increasingly being requested by pregnant women. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that all pregnant women be offered first and second trimester screening options, regardless of risk status, but does not yet recommend NIPT. It is important for prenatal care providers to be aware of and understand these testing options in order to assist women and their families in making well-informed decisions during pregnancy. The purpose of this article is to update midwives and other prenatal care providers on the current prenatal genetic testing options available and how to appropriately offer and discuss them with their clients. We discuss how these tests work; what to do with the results; and most importantly, how to support and communicate accurate information to women and families as they navigate through an increasingly complicated array of testing choices.",

The diagnosis is difficult and frequently delayed. Ascertainment is likely incomplete because of both these factors and because the full phenotypic spectrum may not have been fully delineated. Given the recent development of a blood-based diagnostic test and the development of potential therapies, understanding the incidence of NPC and defining at-risk patient populations are important.\nMETHOD: We evaluated data from four large, massively parallel exome sequencing data sets. Variant sequences were identified and classified as pathogenic or nonpathogenic based on a combination of literature review and bioinformatic analysis. This methodology provided an unbiased approach to determining the allele frequency.\nRESULTS: Our data suggest an incidence rate for NPC1 and NPC2 of 1/92,104 and 1/2,858,998, respectively. Evaluation of common NPC1 variants, however, suggests that there may be a late-onset NPC1 phenotype with a markedly higher incidence, on the order of 1/19,000-1/36,000.\nCONCLUSION: We determined a combined incidence of classical NPC of 1/89,229, or 1.12 affected patients per 100,000 conceptions, but predict incomplete ascertainment of a late-onset phenotype of NPC1.

We also extracted data from other cases in mainland China from the China Academic Journals Full-Text Database by the end of 2012. A total of 127 cases of PCD were summarized and analyzed in this study.\nRESULTS: Seven patients in Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University were finally confirmed to have PCD. All of them had clinical history of recurrent respiratory infection. Imaging analysis showed varying degrees of bronchiectasis. Pulmonary function tests in four patients showed combined obstructive and restrictive patterns. Three cases were confirmed to have PCD by electron microscopy. We then further extracted information from literature for those 127 PCD patients in mainland China. All of them had chronic respiratory infection. Seven cases were complicated with recurrent otitis media and 15 cases were complicated with infertility. A total of 119 patients were diagnosed with situs inversus totalis (94%). Among those 127 patients, only 9 patients' diagnosis was confirmed by electron microscopy. Four patients received sinus resection, and one patient received pulmonary lobectomy due to recurrent hemoptysis. One patient died of massive hemoptysis.\nCONCLUSIONS: Being a rare disease and easily confused with uncomplicated bronchiectasis, PCD diagnosis warrants particular attention.

As genetic sequencing becomes better, cheaper, and more accessible, the expected increase in the number of genetic tests will become evident, resulting in numerous genetic variants that need to be evaluated for disease-causing effects based on database information. The aim of this study was to evaluate genetic variants in four databases and review the relevant literature.\nMETHODS: We assessed background data on 23 common variants registered in ESP6500 and classified as causing MFS in the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD). We evaluated data in four variant databases (HGMD, UMD-FBN1, ClinVar, and UniProt) according to the diagnostic criteria for MFS and compared the results with the classification of each variant in the four databases.\nRESULTS: None of the 23 variants was clearly associated with MFS, even though all classifications in the databases stated otherwise.\nCONCLUSION: A genetic diagnosis of MFS cannot reliably be based on current variant databases because they contain incorrectly interpreted conclusions on variants. Variants must be evaluated by time-consuming review of the background material in the databases and by combining these data with expert knowledge on MFS. This is a major problem because we expect even more genetic test results in the near future as a result of the reduced cost and process time for next-generation sequencing.Genet Med 18 1, 98-102.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: The von Hippel-Lindau (vHL) phenotype is variable, which complicates genetic counseling and surveillance. We describe how the rate of new tumor development varies through the lifetimes of vHL patients and how it is influenced by age and genotype.\nMETHODS: In a national cohort study, we included 52 VHL mutation carriers who were retrospectively followed for a total of 799 person-years. From birth to current age, 581 manifestations were diagnosed during 2,583 examinations in the study subjects. Manifestation rates were analyzed using Poisson regression and compared in groups of different ages, tumor sites, and genotypes.\nRESULTS: The rate of new tumor development varied significantly with age and was highest at 30-34 years (0.4 new tumors/year). Tumor location further influenced the rate. The risk of retinal tumors was highest in subjects during the teenage years but was highest for cerebellar tumors in subjects during their 30s. Truncating VHL mutation carriers had a significantly higher manifestation rate compared with missense mutation carriers (hazard ratio = 1.85, 95% confidence interval: 1.06-3.24, P value = 0.031).\nCONCLUSION: The rate of new manifestation development is not constant throughout the life span of vHL patients; instead, it varies significantly with age and genotype and depends on anatomical location. Retinal surveillance is crucial during the teenage years, whereas cerebellar surveillance is especially important in adulthood.Genet Med 18 1, 89-97.",

        "abstract": "Germ-line mutations in MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 have been shown to cause Lynch syndrome. The penetrance of the cancer and tumor spectrum has been repeatedly studied, and multiple professional societies have proposed clinical management guidelines for affected individuals. Several studies have demonstrated a reduced penetrance for monoallelic carriers of PMS2 mutations compared with the other mismatch repair (MMR) genes, but clinical management guidelines have largely proposed the same screening recommendations for all MMR gene carriers. The authors considered whether enough evidence existed to propose new screening guidelines specific to PMS2 mutation carriers with regard to age at onset and frequency of colonic screening. Published reports of PMS2 germ-line mutations were combined with unpublished cases from the authors' research registries and clinical practices, and a discussion of potential modification of cancer screening guidelines was pursued. A total of 234 monoallelic PMS2 mutation carriers from 170 families were included. Approximately 8% of those with colorectal cancer (CRC) were diagnosed before age 30, and each of these tumors presented on the left side of the colon. As it is currently unknown what causes the early onset of CRC in some families with monoallelic PMS2 germline mutations, the authors recommend against reducing cancer surveillance guidelines in families found having monoallelic PMS2 mutations in spite of the reduced penetrance.Genet Med 18 1, 13-19.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Essential tremor (ET) is the most common tremor disorder in adults. In addition to upper limbs, the tremor in ET may also involve head, jaw, voice, tongue, and trunk. Though head tremor (HT) is commonly present in patients with ET, large comparative studies of ET patients with HT (HT+) and without HT (HT-) are few.\nMETHODS: To determine whether ET with HT is a distinct clinical subtype by comparing ET patients with and without HT, a chart review of 234 consecutive patients with ET attending the neurology clinics of the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences, India, was done. A movement disorder specialist confirmed the diagnosis of ET in all patients using the National Institutes of Health collaborative genetic criteria.\nRESULTS: HT was present in 44.4% of the patients. Comparison between HT+ and HT- showed that the HT+ group patients: (1) were older, (2) had later onset of tremor, (3) had unimodal distribution of age at onset with a single peak in the fifth decade, (4) had more frequent voice tremor, and (5) were more likely to have mild cervical dystonia. HT was part of presenting symptoms in nearly two thirds of the ET patients and in the rest it was detected during clinical examination.\nCONCLUSIONS: Several demographic and clinical variables suggest that ET patients with HT have a distinct clinical phenotype.",

Despite the availability of neuroimaging and neurophysiological testing, tools for accurate early diagnosis and prediction of developmental outcome are still lacking. The goal of this study was to determine if combined use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) findings could support outcome prediction.\nMETHODS: We retrospectively reviewed records of 17 HIE neonates, classified brain MRI and EEG findings based on severity, and assessed clinical outcome up to 48 months. We determined the relation between MRI/EEG findings and clinical outcome.\nRESULTS: We demonstrated a significant relationship between MRI findings and clinical outcome (Fisher's exact test, p\u00a0=\u00a00.017). EEG provided no additional information about the outcome beyond that contained in the MRI score. The statistical model for outcome prediction based on random forests suggested that EEG readings at 24 hours and 72 hours could be important variables for outcome prediction, but this needs to be investigated further.\nCONCLUSION: Caution should be used when discussing prognosis for neonates with mild-to-moderate HIE based on early MR imaging and EEG findings. A robust, quantitative marker of HIE severity that allows for accurate prediction of long-term outcome, particularly for mild-to-moderate cases, is still needed.",

        "abstract": "Monitoring and surveillance strategies are imperative for managing genetic defects in livestock populations in order to avoid detrimental effects on animal welfare and productivity. Recently, a number of previously unknown defects have been described in cattle, fostered by the huge progress in genome analysis and genomic selection. In response to reports about a potentially new defect in Holstein cattle, case-control studies were carried out to confirm a genetic background of the defect and to evaluate its phenotypic relevance. Eighty-five potentially affected offspring of a suspected carrier sire for the defect and 41 matched control calves were subjected to clinical and epidemiological monitoring on 39 farms. Forty-one animals, all offspring of the suspected carrier sire, showed pathognomonic tail malformations providing highly significant evidence for a congenital inherited defect, which was subsequently termed vertebral and spinal dysplasia (VSD). The defect is characterised by vertebral (specifically tail) deformities and neurological dysfunctions with gait abnormalities of the hind limbs. The deformities and neurological dysfunctions varied from very mild (only tail deformities) to severe (paraparesis). Detailed epidemiological monitoring provided no indication of environmental factors affecting VSD. The malformations and dysfunctions associated with VSD, as well as its mode of inheritance and the genotyping of the suspected carrier sire, indicated that VSD is a defect previously not described in cattle. VSD is inherited in a dominant mode, but shows incomplete penetrance of the phenotype, which impedes unequivocal identification of VSD carriers. A direct diagnostic genetic test for VSD is available.",

Neuropsychological testing was available for 5429-32,070 subjects of European ancestry aged 45 years or older, free of dementia and clinical stroke at the time of cognitive testing from 20 cohorts in the discovery phase. We analyzed performance on the Trail Making Test parts A and B, the Letter Digit Substitution Test (LDST), the Digit Symbol Substitution Task (DSST), semantic and phonemic fluency tests, and the Stroop Color and Word Test. Replication was sought in 1311-21860 subjects from 20 independent cohorts. A significant association was observed in the discovery cohorts for the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs17518584 (discovery P-value=3.12 \u00d7 10(-8)) and in the joint discovery and replication meta-analysis (P-value=3.28 \u00d7 10(-9) after adjustment for age, gender and education) in an intron of the gene cell adhesion molecule 2 (CADM2) for performance on the LDST/DSST. Rs17518584 is located about 170 kb upstream of the transcription start site of the major transcript for the CADM2 gene, but is within an intron of a variant transcript that includes an alternative first exon. The variant is associated with expression of CADM2 in the cingulate cortex (P-value=4 \u00d7 10(-4)). The protein encoded by CADM2 is involved in glutamate signaling (P-value=7.22 \u00d7 10(-15)), gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transport (P-value=1.36 \u00d7 10(-11)) and neuron cell-cell adhesion (P-value=1.48 \u00d7 10(-13)).

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: With the aging of the population living with HIV, the absolute risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is increasing. There is a need to further facilitate the identification of persons at elevated risk in routine practice.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Prospective information was collected on 32,663 HIV-positive persons from 20 countries in Europe and Australia, who were free of CVD at entry into the Data-collection on Adverse Effects of Anti-HIV Drugs (D:A:D) study. Cox regression models (full and reduced) were developed that predict the risk of a global CVD endpoint. The predictive performance of the D:A:D models were compared with a recent CVD prediction model from the Framingham study, which was assessed recalibrated to the D:A:D dataset. A total of 1010 CVD events occurred during 186,364.5 person-years. The full D:A:D CVD prediction model included age, gender, systolic blood pressure, smoking status, family history of CVD, diabetes, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, CD4 lymphocyte count, cumulative exposure to protease- and nucleoside reverse transcriptase-inhibitors, and current use of abacavir. A reduced model omitted antiretroviral therapies. The D:A:D models statistically significantly predicted risk more accurately than the recalibrated Framingham model (Harrell's c-statistic of 0.791, 0.783 and 0.766 for the D:A:D full, D:A:D reduced, and Framingham models respectively; p\u2009<\u20090.001). The D:A:D models also more accurately predicted five-year CVD-risk for key prognostic subgroups.\nCONCLUSIONS: An updated, easily recalibrated, global CVD-risk equation tailored to HIV-positive persons was developed using routinely collected CVD risk parameters and incorporating markers on immune function (CD4 lymphocyte count), and exposure to antiretroviral therapies. The estimated CVD risk can be used to quantify risk and to guide preventive care.",

Twenty-two neuroblastoma samples of patients who were surgically treated at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf were evaluated immunohistochemically for expression of CAIX. Results were correlated with clinical parameters and outcome. Neuroblastoma Kelly and SH-EP-Tet-21/N cells were examined for CAIX expression and inhibited with specific inhibitors, FC5-207A and FC8-325A. 32% of neuroblastoma tumors expressed CAIX. This was significantly associated with poorer survival. Kelly and SH-EP-Tet-21/N cells showed a major increase of CAIX RNA under hypoxic conditions. Proliferation of Kelly cells was significantly decreased by CAIX inhibitors, FC5-207A and FC8-325A, while proliferation of SH-EP-Tet-21/N cells was only significantly affected by FC8-325A.

The aim of this study was to assess the association between breast feeding (BF) and birth weight (BW) with anthropometric measures and blood pressure (BP) in a nationally-representative sample of Iranian children and adolescents.\nMETHODS: In this national survey, 14,880 children and adolescents, aged 6-18 years, were selected using a multistage, cluster sampling method from rural and urban areas of 30 provinces of Iran. BF duration and BW were assessed by validated questionnaires completed by parents.\nRESULTS: The study participants were 13,486 students (participation rate of 90.6%). They consisted of 49.24% girls, 75.6% urban residents, with a mean age of 12.5 years (95% confidence interval: 12.3-12.6). The family history of obesity had a significant association with BW (p < 0.001). A substantial association was found between BF duration and the order of children in the family, both in boys (p < 0.001) and girls (p < 0.001). The mean values for height, weight, body mass index, as well as waist, wrist, and hip circumferences were higher in those with higher BW categories (p for trend < 0.001). As BW increased, there was a linear decrease in underweight (p for trend < 0.001) and a linear increase in the prevalence of generalized obesity (p for trend < 0.001) was documented.\nCONCLUSION: BW was associated with a higher prevalence in general obesity and a lower prevalence of being underweight.

We evaluate the performance of an HRMA-based kit for a carrier-screening test of SMA that was designed to detect the substitution of a single nucleotide in SMN1 exon 7. Carriers were identified in 453 participants by quantifying the SMN1 gene and compared with denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) assay.

All the neonates underwent DPOAE testing in both ears (the f2 primary tone was presented at 2.0, 2.5, 3.2, and 4.0 kHz). We found that 41 patients in group A (39.0%) and 13 in group B (43.3%) failed the DPOAE test in one or both ears; the difference between these two groups was not statistically significant (p = 0.673). In group C, the DPOAE fail rate was 13.8% (4 newborns). In group A, there was no statistically significant association between the pass/fail rate and the specific aminoglycoside that was administered, or in the duration of antibiotic treatment, the number of doses, and the size of the mean daily dose and the mean total dose. In clinical practice, DPOAE testing is a sensitive method of evaluating the integrity of the outer hair cells in the basal turn of the cochlea after exposure to ototoxic drugs such as aminoglycosides.

Moreover, a preliminary genome of N. denticulata is available and efforts toward complete genome sequencing and transcriptome sequencing have been initiated. Neocaridina denticulata possesses the best combination of traits that make it most suitable as a model for functional genomics.

        "abstract": "The insecticide chlordecone applied for decades in banana plantations currently contaminates 20,000 ha of arable land in the French West Indies. Although the impact of various pesticides on soil microorganisms has been studied, chlordecone toxicity to the soil microbial community has never been assessed. We investigated in two different soils (sandy loam and silty loam) exposed to different concentrations of CLD (D0, control; D1 and D10, 1 and 10 times the agronomical dose) over different periods of time (3, 7, and 32 days): (i) the fate of chlordecone by measuring (14)C-chlordecone mass balance and (ii) the impact of chlordecone on microbial community structure, abundance, and function, using standardized methods (-A-RISA, taxon-specific quantitative PCR (qPCR), and (14)C-compounds mineralizing activity). Mineralization of (14)C-chlordecone was inferior below 1 % of initial (14)C-activity. Less than 2 % of (14)C-activity was retrieved from the water-soluble fraction, while most of it remained in the organic-solvent-extractable fraction (75 % of initial (14)C-activity). Only 23 % of the remaining (14)C-activity was measured in nonextractable fraction. The fate of chlordecone significantly differed between the two soils. The soluble and nonextractable fractions were significantly higher in sandy loam soil than in silty loam soil. All the measured microbiological parameters allowed discriminating statistically the two soils and showed a variation over time. The genetic structure of the bacterial community remained insensitive to chlordecone exposure in silty loam soil. In response to chlordecone exposure, the abundance of Gram-negative bacterial groups (\u03b2-, \u03b3-Proteobacteria, Planctomycetes, and Bacteroidetes) was significantly modified only in sandy loam soil. The mineralization of (14)C-sodium acetate and (14)C-2,4-D was insensitive to chlordecone exposure in silty loam soil. However, mineralization of (14)C-sodium acetate was significantly reduced in soil microcosms of sandy loam soil exposed to chlordecone as compared to the control (D0). These data show that chlordecone exposure induced changes in microbial community taxonomic composition and function in one of the two soils, suggesting microbial toxicity of this organochlorine.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Determining whether anti-D represents active or passive alloimmunization after RhIg administration is challenging. The objectives were to use antibody reaction strength to differentiate patients who may have become RhD alloimmunized during pregnancy from those manifesting passive anti-D and to investigate which methods work best for this determination.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were collected from patients residing in the Edmonton region of Canada, \u226518 years old, undergoing antibody screening in late pregnancy, who received 300 \u03bcg (1500 IU) of RhIg in the preceding 120 days. A total of 1106 tests were performed on 1050 blood samples from 963 patients: 640 by PEG, 156 by gel-card and 310 by solid-phase methodology.\nRESULTS: PEG was the least sensitive to passive anti-D, with significantly fewer positive results at \u22658 weeks after RhIg compared to the other methods. Strength of reactivity and time since RhIg injection could be used to identify patients at high risk using PEG as a 4+ reaction at any time, \u22653+ at >2 weeks, \u22652+ at >6 weeks and \u22651+ at >14 weeks. Similarly, the gel-card method thresholds were 4+ at >5 weeks, \u22653+ at >10 weeks and \u22652+ at >15 weeks. Reaction strength by solid-phase was too variable to establish useful thresholds by this method. Infant RhD status did not significantly affect results.\nCONCLUSION: Patients can be risk stratified for alloimmunization by anti-D reaction strength and time after RhIg administration. The PEG method was the best of those investigated, but the gel-card method can also be used.",

        "abstract": "Oyster species suffer from numerous disease outbreaks, often causing high mortality. Because the environment cannot be controlled, genetic improvement for disease resistance to pathogens is an attractive option to reduce their impact on oyster production. We review the literature on selective breeding programs for disease resistance in oyster species, and the impact of triploidy on such resistance. Significant response to selection to improve disease resistance was observed in all studies after two to four generations of selection for Haplosporidium nelsoni and Roseovarius crassostrea in Crassostrea virginica, OsHV-1 in Crassostrea gigas, and Martelia sydneyi in Saccostrea glomerata. Clearly, resistance in these cases was heritable, but most of the studies failed to provide estimates for heritability or genetic correlations with other traits, e.g., between resistance to one disease and another. Generally, it seems breeding for higher resistance to one disease does not confer higher resistance or susceptibility to another disease. For disease resistance in triploid oysters, several studies showed that triploidy confers neither advantage nor disadvantage in survival, e.g., OsHV-1 resistance in C. gigas. Other studies showed higher disease resistance of triploids over diploid as observed in C. virginica and S. glomerata. One indirect mechanism for triploids to avoid disease was to grow faster, thus limiting the span of time when oysters might be exposed to disease.",

The purpose of this pilot study was to investigate the association between active Hp-I, confirmed by histology, and CIS and to evaluate the impact of Hp eradication on the CIS clinical course.\nMATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a study on 48 patients with CIS and 20 matched controls. At baseline, apart from histology, serum anti-Hp-specific IgG titer, inflammatory mediators, and HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-DR genetic polymorphisms were estimated. Hp-positive patients received standard triple eradication regimen, and all patients were followed up for 2 years.\nRESULTS: The prevalence of Hp-I was significantly higher in patients with CIS (43/48, 89.6%) than in control (10/20, 50%) (P < 0.001, OR: 8.6, 95% CI: 2.4-30.8). When compared with controls, patients with CIS also showed significantly higher serum anti-Hp IgG titer and HLA-A26, HLA-A30, and HLA-B57 frequencies. Hp-positive patients also showed higher serum concentrations of inflammatory cytokines and homocysteine. At 2-year clinical endpoint, in the subgroup of CIS patients with successful Hp eradication, the number of patients who presented with a second episode was significantly lower accompanied by significant improvement in mean Expanded Disability Status Scale score.\nCONCLUSIONS: Hp-I seems more frequent in a Greek CIS cohort and its eradication might delay CIS progression, suggesting a possible link between Hp-I and CIS.",

        "abstract": "The clinical course of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) is characterized by wide variability reflecting the underlying genetic and biological heterogeneity of the disease. Accurate prediction of outcomes for individual patients is an integral part of the evidence-based risk/benefit calculations that are necessary for tailoring the aggressiveness of therapeutic interventions. While several prognostication tools have been developed and validated for risk stratification, each of these systems has limitations. The recent progress in genomic sequencing techniques has led to discoveries of recurrent molecular mutations in MDS patients with independent impact on relevant clinical outcomes. Reliable assays of these mutations have already entered the clinic and efforts are currently ongoing to formally incorporate mutational analysis into the existing clinicopathologic risk stratification tools. Additionally, mutational analysis holds promise for going beyond prognostication to therapeutic selection and individualized treatment-specific prediction of outcomes; abilities that would revolutionize MDS patient care. Despite these exciting developments, the best way of incorporating molecular testing for use in prognostication and prediction of outcomes in clinical practice remains undefined and further research is warranted.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Parental empowerment signifies parents' sense of confidence in managing their children, interacting with services that their children use and improving child care services. High empowerment is associated with parents' resilience to demands and their confidence to make decisions and take actions that positively affect their families. Most families with children access various healthcare and education services. Professionals working in these services are therefore ideally placed to reinforce parental empowerment. However, little is known about the characteristics associated with parental empowerment within a generic sample of parents or in the context of basic child care services.\nAIM: The aim of this study was to assess how family characteristics are associated with maternal and paternal empowerment in the family, in service situations and in the service system.\nMETHOD: Parental empowerment was measured among 955 parents (mothers\u2009=\u2009571; fathers\u2009=\u2009384) of children aged 0-9\u2009years using the Generic Family Empowerment Scale. Family characteristics were assessed through questions on children, parents and the life situation. Associations between empowerment and family characteristics were evaluated using one-way analysis of variance and t-test. Parental empowerment was predicted by multiple linear regression analysis.\nRESULTS: Parents' concerns related to their parenting, such as whether they possessed sufficient skills as a parent or losing their temper with children, as well as experiences of stress in everyday life, were negatively associated with all dimensions of maternal and paternal empowerment. Both determinants were more common and more significant in empowerment than child-related problems.\nCONCLUSION: Promoting parental self-confidence and providing appropriate emotional and concrete support for everyday functioning may reinforce parental empowerment, thereby enhancing families' well-being and coping, as well as improving their access to required services and timely support. Finally, it may facilitate the provision of better services to all families.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: About 15,000 persons receive the diagnosis of kidney cancer in Germany every year. Surgical resection is the standard treatment for locally confined tumors, but minimally invasive thermoablative techniques are increasingly being used as well.\nMETHODS: This article is based on publications retrieved by a selective literature search in PubMed regarding the thermoablative techniques now used in clinical practice, with particular attention to radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and cryoablation (CA).\nRESULTS: RFA and CA are suitable for patients who cannot undergo surgery because of comorbid illnesses or who have contralateral recurrences or a hereditary precancerous condition. The primary technical success rate of these procedures ranges from 88% to 100%. More than 95% of tumors under 3 cm in diameter can be completely ablated. Reported complication rates range from 1% to 7%. New data on long-term outcomes reveal metastasis-free survival rates of 88% to 99% five years after ablation. A major advantage of these procedures is that thermoablation does not impair renal function to any relevant extent and is thus a good option for patients with limited renal function or a single kidney.\nCONCLUSION: The thermoablative techniques are an important addition to the armamentarium of effective treatments for locally confined renal tumors. The guidelines of the American and European urological societies now list thermoablation with RFA or CA as an option for the treatment of small renal tumors with curative intent. Thermoablation of renal tumors has not yet been studied in randomized controlled trials; these will be needed so that the efficacy of tumor control, survival rates, complication rates, and quality of life after treatment can be reliably evaluated to provide definitive confirmation of the value of interstitial techniques.",

The first group was given normal food and water (control). The second group was given normal food and GumA (15% w/v) in drinking water. The third group was fed powder diet containing adenine (ADE) (0\u00b775% w/w in feed). The fourth group was fed like in the third group, plus GumA in drinking water (15%, w/v).\nRESULTS: ADE feeding induced CRF (as measured by several physiological, biochemical and histological indices) and also caused a significant genetic damage and significant decreases in urinary 8-oxo Gua and 8-oxoGuo, but not in the other nucleic acids. However, concomitant GumA treatment reduced the level of genetic damage in kidney cells as detected by Comet assay and significantly reversed the effect of adenine on urinary 8-oxoGuo.\nCONCLUSIONS: Treatment with GumA is able to mitigate genetic damage in renal tissues of rats with ADE-induced CRF.",

        "abstract": "In 1996, a new type of bilateral hearing disorder was discerned and published almost simultaneously by Kaga et al. [1] and Starr et al. [2]. Although the pathophysiology of this disorder as reported by each author was essentially identical, Kaga used the term \"auditory nerve disease\" and Starr used the term \"auditory neuropathy\". Auditory neuropathy (AN) in adults is an acquired disorder characterized by mild-to-moderate pure-tone hearing loss, poor speech discrimination, and absence of the auditory brainstem response (ABR) all in the presence of normal cochlear outer hair cell function as indicated by normal distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) and evoked summating potentials (SPs) by electrocochleography (ECoG). A variety of processes and etiologies are thought to be involved in its pathophysiology including mutations of the OTOF and/or OPA1 genes. Most of the subsequent reports in the literature discuss the various auditory profiles of patients with AN [3,4] and in this report we present the profiles of an additional 17 cases of adult AN. Cochlear implants are useful for the reacquisition of hearing in adult AN although hearing aids are ineffective. In 2008, the new term of Auditory Neuropathy Spectrum Disorders (ANSD) was proposed by the Colorado Children's Hospital group following a comprehensive study of newborn hearing test results. When ABRs were absent and DPOAEs were present in particular cases during newborn screening they were classified as ANSD. In 2013, our group in the Tokyo Medical Center classified ANSD into three types by following changes in ABRs and DPOAEs over time with development. In Type I, there is normalization of hearing over time, Type II shows a change into profound hearing loss and Type III is true auditory neuropathy (AN). We emphasize that, in adults, ANSD is not the same as AN.",

        "abstract": "Extensive similarities in the molecular architecture of the crustacean immune system to that of insects give credence to the current view that the Hexapoda, including Insecta, arose within the clade Pancrustacea. The crustacean immune system is mediated largely by hemocytes, relying on suites of pattern recognition receptors, effector functions, and signaling pathways that parallel those of insects. In crustaceans, as in insects, the cardiovascular system facilitates movement of hemocytes and delivery of soluble immune factors, thereby supporting immune surveillance and defense along with other physiological functions such as transport of nutrients, wastes, and hormones. Crustaceans also rely heavily on their cardiovascular systems to mediate gas exchange; insects are less reliant on internal circulation for this function. Among the largest crustaceans, the decapods have developed a condensed heart and a highly arteriolized cardiovascular system that supports the metabolic demands of their often large body size. However, recent studies indicate that mounting an immune response can impair gas exchange and metabolism in their highly developed vascular system. When circulating hemocytes detect the presence of potential pathogens, they aggregate rapidly with each other and with the pathogen. These growing aggregates can become trapped in the microvasculature of the gill where they are melanized and may be eliminated at the next molt. Prior to molting, trapped aggregates of hemocytes also can impair hemolymph flow and oxygenation at the gill. Small shifts to anaerobic metabolism only partially compensate for this decrease in oxygen uptake. The resulting metabolic depression is likely to impact other energy-expensive cellular processes and whole-animal performance. For crustaceans that often live in microbially-rich, but oxygen-poor aquatic environments, there appear to be distinct tradeoffs, based on the gill's multiple roles in respiration and immunity. Insects have developed a separate tracheal system for the delivery of oxygen to tissues, so this particular tradeoff between oxygen transport and immune function is avoided. Few studies in crustaceans or insects have tested whether mounting an immune response might impact other functions of the cardiovascular system or alter integrity of the gut, respiratory, and reproductive epithelia where processes of the attack on pathogens, defense by the host, and physiological functions play out. Such tradeoffs might be fruitfully addressed by capitalizing on the ease of molecular and genetic manipulation in insects. Given the extensive similarities between the insect and the crustacean immune systems, such models of epithelial infection could benefit our understanding of the physiological consequences of immune defense in all of the Pancrustacea.",

Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) frequently involves drugs with narrow therapeutic windows and can be harmful to the patient if changes are made based on erroneous serum drug concentrations. Too little of the drug will result in ineffective therapy and too much of the drug can cause life threatening toxicities. There are many factors that can result in unexpected serum drug concentrations including differences in analytical methods being used, diet, timing of blood draw, genotype and compliance. All these factors should all be considered before deciding if changes should be made in a patient's therapeutic course.\nCASE REPORT: We determined the cause of 2 patient's unexpected TDM concentrations for sirolimus and tacrolimus. Using this approach in 2 patient cases, we describe how co-treatment and uncommon genotypes result in unexpected drug concentrations.\nCONCLUSIONS: Both cases involved unexpected drug values. In the first case, the cause was revealed to be a drug that was added to the patient's treatment regimen (posaconazole) that inhibits CYP3A4 which is responsible for sirolimus metabolism. In the second case, the patient was revealed to have an uncommon genotype for CYP3A5, causing higher metabolism and lower serum tacrolimus concentrations than the general population.",

        "abstract": "Adjuvant endocrine therapy (ET) reduces the odds of distant recurrence and mortality by nearly one-half in women with hormone receptor (HR) positive early stage breast cancer. While the risk of recurrence is lower for HR positive than negative patients during the first 5-7 years, HR positive patients suffer ongoing recurrences between 0.5 and 2% year over subsequent years. Extended adjuvant ET further reduces recurrence during this late phase of follow-up. ET is associated with post-menopausal side effects (hot flashes, sexual dysfunction, mood changes, and weight gain), and occasional major toxicities (thrombosis and endometrial cancer with tamoxifen; bone mineral loss and possibly heart disease with AIs) persist throughout therapy. Accurate and reliable estimates of the risk of recurrence after five years of ET for women with prior HR positive breast cancer would permit appropriate extended ET decisions. The risk of long-term relapse is related to lymph node status and size of tumor, but these are relatively crude. Several groups have investigated whether multi-parameter tumor biomarker tests might identify those patients whose risk of recurrence is so low that extended ET is not justified. These assays include IHC4, the 21-gene \"OncotypeDX\", the 12-gene \"Endopredict,\" the PAM50, and the 2-gene \"Breast Cancer Index (BCI)\" assays. The clinical validity of all these tests for this use context have been established, with at least one paper for each that shows a statistically significant difference in risk of distant recurrence during the 5-10 years after the initial five years of adjuvant endocrine therapy. However, the stakes are high, and although each of these represents a \"prospective retrospective\" study, they require further validation in subsequent datasets before they should be considered to have \"clinical utility\" and are used to withhold potentially life-saving treatment. Perhaps more importantly, the clinical breast cancer community, and especially the patient, need to determine how low the risk of late recurrence needs to be to forego the toxicities and side effects of extended adjuvant ET.",

Phenotyping by administration of a selective enzyme substrate, followed by the determination of a specific phenotyping metric, is an appropriate approach to assess the in vivo activity of CYP450 enzymes as it takes into account all influencing factors. A phenotyping protocol should be as simple and convenient as possible. Typically, phenotyping metrics are determined in traditional matrices, such as blood, plasma or urine. Several sampling strategies have been proposed as an alternative for these traditional sampling techniques. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of available methods using dried blood spots (DBS), hair, oral fluid, exhaled breath and sweat for in vivo CYP450 phenotyping. We discuss the relation between phenotyping metrics measured in these samples and those in conventional matrices, along with the advantages and limitations of the alternative sampling techniques. Reliable phenotyping procedures for several clinically relevant CYP450 enzymes, including CYP1A2, CYP2C19 and CYP2D6, are currently available for oral fluid, breath or DBS, while additional studies are needed for other CYP450 isoforms, such as CYP3A4. The role of hair analysis for this purpose remains to be established. Being non- or minimally invasive, these sampling strategies provide convenient and patient-friendly alternatives for classical phenotyping procedures, which may contribute to the implementation of CYP450 phenotyping in clinical practice.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: The expression of HAGE as a novel prognostic and predictive tool was assessed in 1,079 triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC).\nEXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: HAGE protein expression was investigated in an early primary TNBC (EP-TNBC; n = 520) cohort who received adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT) and in a locally advanced primary TNBC cohort who received anthracycline combination Neo-ACT (n = 110; AC-Neo-ACT). HAGE-mRNA expression was evaluated in the METABRIC-TNBC cohort (n = 311) who received ACT and in a cohort of patients with TNBC who received doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide Neo-ACT, followed by 1:1 randomization to ixabepilone (n = 68) or paclitaxel (n = 64) as part of a phase II clinical trial. Furthermore, a cohort of 128 tumors with integrated HAGE gene copy number changes, mRNA, and protein levels were analyzed.\nRESULTS: In patients with EP-TNBC, who were chemotherapy-na\u00efve, high HAGE protein expression (HAGE(+)) was associated with a higher risk of death [HR, 1.3; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.2-1.5; P = 0.000005] when compared with HAGE(-) cases. Patients who received ACT and expressed mRNA-HAGE(+) were at a lower risk of death than those who were mRNA-HAGE(-) (P = 0.004). The expression of HAGE was linked to the presence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL), and both features were found to be independent predictors for pathologic complete response (pCR, P < 0.001) and associated with prolonged survival (P < 0.01), following AC-Neo-ACT. In patients with residual disease, HAGE(+) had a 2-fold death risk increase (P = 0.018) compared with HAGE(-).\nCONCLUSIONS: HAGE expression is a potential prognostic marker and a predictor of response to anthracycline treatment in TNBC. A prospective clinical trial to examine the therapeutic value of HAGE for TNBC cases is warranted.",

        "abstract": "Causative variants in APP, PSEN1 or PSEN2 account for a majority of cases of autosomal dominant early-onset Alzheimer disease (ADEOAD, onset before 65 years). Variant detection rates in other EOAD patients, that is, with family history of late-onset AD (LOAD) (and no incidence of EOAD) and sporadic cases might be much lower. We analyzed the genomes from 264 patients using whole-exome sequencing (WES) with high depth of coverage: 90 EOAD patients with family history of LOAD and no incidence of EOAD in the family and 174 patients with sporadic AD starting between 51 and 65 years. We found three PSEN1 and one PSEN2 causative, probably or possibly causative variants in four patients (1.5%). Given the absence of PSEN1, PSEN2 and APP causative variants, we investigated whether these 260 patients might be burdened with protein-modifying variants in 20 genes that were previously shown to cause other types of dementia when mutated. For this analysis, we included an additional set of 160 patients who were previously shown to be free of causative variants in PSEN1, PSEN2 and APP: 107 ADEOAD patients and 53 sporadic EOAD patients with an age of onset before 51 years. In these 420 patients, we detected no variant that might modify the function of the 20 dementia-causing genes. We conclude that EOAD patients with family history of LOAD and no incidence of EOAD in the family or patients with sporadic AD starting between 51 and 65 years have a low variant-detection rate in AD genes.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Epidemiologic studies involving birth defects are extremely sensitive to phenotype accuracy and precision. We devised a case review and classification protocol for a project to study school achievement in children with idiopathic, nonsyndromic orofacial clefts to improve the reliability of phenotypic classification from the statewide birth defects registry.\nMETHODS: Surveillance-program abstraction data and medical records at the birth or treating hospitals were used when available. Exclusion criteria included: median cleft lip; Tessier cleft; premaxillary agenesis; presence of a recognizable syndrome, phenotype, association, or sequence (other than Robin sequence); clefts with other malformations not considered to be normal or common variants in the newborn; and cases with documented or suspected genetic or teratogenic causes.\nRESULTS: Of 712 children identified with orofacial clefts, 153 were excluded, leaving 559 nonsyndromic orofacial cleft cases of unknown cause in the final study. These cases were grouped into the following clinically meaningful types: cleft lip with or without cleft alveolus; cleft lip and cleft palate; and cleft palate only. This review and classification process resulted in the elimination of 21.5% of the original cohort of identified cases, with most exclusions being due to suspected syndromic associations.\nCONCLUSION: Verbatim descriptions of the clinical findings are critical for accurate classification of diagnoses. This review process improved the precision of orofacial cleft phenotype classification for our study. Precision would have been further improved if all of the cases had verbatim descriptions of diagnoses and all medical records could have been reviewed by the classification team.",

The objective of this study was to describe and evaluate the role of evidence analysts in the systematic review phase of guideline development to improve quality of process and output and inform future guideline development projects.\nMETHODS: Recruitment, training and output of evidence analysts were documented throughout the MSUD project. The role of analysts was to critically review and rate the scientific quality of published literature and abstract pertinent information using quality checklists and abstraction worksheets. A secure, web-based application was developed to standardize the process and establish permanent documentation. Analysts completed a post-project survey on perceptions of their role, training and the evidence analysis process.\nRESULTS: Of 23 recruits, 65% (15) completed evidence analyst training; 73% of those (11) participated in the analysis of 98 literature articles. Analysts reviewed a median of four articles (range 1-16) with median productivity of 1.1 articles per month. All analysts surveyed (n\u2009=\u20099) understood their role and agreed that training was adequate; 100% agreed that analyst involvement was critical in developing guidelines for MSUD.\nCONCLUSION: Evidence analysts played a key role in appraising and abstracting evidence to develop nutrition guidelines for MSUD. With critical improvements to the process, particularly more stringent and systematic evaluation and documentation of analyst performance related to productivity and quality, we will continue to recruit, train and support evidence analysts in evidence-based guideline development projects.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Nowadays, 65-80% of pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (PPGL) cases are explained by germline or somatic mutations in one of 22 genes. Several genetic testing algorithms have been proposed, but they usually exclude sporadic-PPGLs (S-PPGLs) and none include somatic testing. We aimed to genetically characterise S-PPGL cases and propose an evidence-based algorithm for genetic testing, prioritising DNA source.\nMETHODS: The study included 329 probands fitting three criteria: single PPGL, no syndromic and no PPGL family history. Germline DNA was tested for point mutations in RET and for both point mutation and gross deletions in VHL, the SDH genes, TMEM127, MAX and FH. 99 tumours from patients negative for germline screening were available and tested for RET, VHL, HRAS, EPAS1, MAX and SDHB.\nRESULTS: Germline mutations were found in 46 (14.0%) patients, being more prevalent in paragangliomas (PGLs) (28.7%) than in pheochromocytomas (PCCs) (4.5%) (p=6.62\u00d710(-10)). Somatic mutations were found in 43% of those tested, being more prevalent in PCCs (48.5%) than in PGLs (32.3%) (p=0.13). A quarter of S-PPGLs had a somatic mutation, regardless of age at presentation. Head and neck PGLs (HN-PGLs) and thoracic-PGLs (T-PGLs) more commonly had germline mutations (p=2.0\u00d710(-4) and p=0.027, respectively). Five of the 29 metastatic cases harboured a somatic mutation, one in HRAS.\nCONCLUSIONS: We recommend prioritising testing for germline mutations in patients with HN-PGLs and T-PGLs, and for somatic mutations in those with PCC. Biochemical secretion and SDHB-immunohistochemistry should guide genetic screening in abdominal-PGLs. Paediatric and metastatic cases should not be excluded from somatic screening.",

A decade ago, MRSA colonisation was studied in Swiss paediatric hospitals and revealed an extraordinarily low proportion (<1 %). The primary goal of this study was to determine if the current proportion of nasal colonisation with MRSA in hospitalised children was still favourable. We aimed to screen all children from the age of 0-16 years admitted to the paediatric and surgical wards at the University Children's Hospital Basel (UKBB) during 8 pre-defined surveillance weeks. After obtaining consent, a nasal swab was taken and analysed for growth of S. aureus. Furthermore, a standardised questionnaire was completed by interview with a parent. Of 535 eligible children, 340 (64 %) were enrolled. Mean age was 6.2 years (median 4.3, IQR 1 to 11.25), 111 (33 %) children were colonised with S. aureus but no MRSA was found.\nCONCLUSION: The prevalence of MRSA in children admitted to the UKBB during this surveillance period was zero. General MRSA screening in hospitalised children continues to be unjustified in our area.\nWHAT IS KNOWN: \u2022 The prevalence of nasal methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) colonisation in children is increasing in many regions worldwide. \u2022 Surveillance for MRSA colonisation in healthcare settings varies considerably.\nWHAT IS NEW: \u2022 Periodic and risk-factor-based surveillance for MRSA colonisation is sufficient when regional prevalence is low.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Genome-wide association study meta-analyses have robustly implicated three loci that affect susceptibility for smoking: CHRNA5\\CHRNA3\\CHRNB4, CHRNB3\\CHRNA6 and EGLN2\\CYP2A6. Functional follow-up studies of these loci are needed to provide insight into biological mechanisms. However, these efforts have been hampered by a lack of knowledge about the specific causal variant(s) involved. In this study, we prioritized variants in terms of the likelihood they account for the reported associations.\nMETHODS: We employed targeted capture of the CHRNA5\\CHRNA3\\CHRNB4, CHRNB3\\CHRNA6, and EGLN2\\CYP2A6 loci and flanking regions followed by next-generation deep sequencing (mean coverage 78\u00d7) to capture genomic variation in 363 individuals. We performed single locus tests to determine if any single variant accounts for the association, and examined if sets of (rare) variants that overlapped with biologically meaningful annotations account for the associations.\nRESULTS: In total, we investigated 963 variants, of which 71.1% were rare (minor allele frequency < 0.01), 6.02% were insertion/deletions, and 51.7% were catalogued in dbSNP141. The single variant results showed that no variant fully accounts for the association in any region. In the variant set results, CHRNB4 accounts for most of the signal with significant sets consisting of directly damaging variants. CHRNA6 explains most of the signal in the CHRNB3\\CHRNA6 locus with significant sets indicating a regulatory role for CHRNA6. Significant sets in CYP2A6 involved directly damaging variants while the significant variant sets suggested a regulatory role for EGLN2.\nCONCLUSIONS: We found that multiple variants implicating multiple processes explain the signal. Some variants can be prioritized for functional follow-up.",

Hematological analysis including complete blood counts and quantification of Hb levels were performed by capillary electrophoresis. The identified carriers were further detected for molecular analysis by multiple gap-polymerase chain reactions (gap-PCR) and the PCR-reverse dot-blot.\nRESULTS: Hematological results showed that 345 subjects were identified to be Hb E carriers (1.1%). The high incidence of carrying Hb E occurred in Achang (25.0%), Jingpo (23.5%), Dai (16.0%), and Lisu (13.6%). After performing molecular analysis in 201 carriers, 192 cases (95.5%) were heterozygous Hb E and 29 cases (14.4%) of Hb E were con-inherited with \u03b1-thal cases. The other \u03b2-globin chain mutation included homozygous Hb E (three cases), \u03b2(+)-thal/Hb E (one case) and \u03b2(0)-thal/Hb E (five cases). Individuals in Dai had the most types of Hb E-related disorders. Severe anemia was observed in cases of \u03b2(+)-thal/Hb E and \u03b2(0)-thal/Hb E.\nCONCLUSIONS: There is a high prevalence of Hb E among Yunnan populations, especially in ethnic groups. In addition, the spectrums of Hb gene mutations would provide a support for the genetic counseling of Hb E-related disorders among Yunnan populations.",

The aim of this study was to identify predictors of psychosocial well-being of parents of affected children.\nMETHODS: The study included a total sample of 287 parents (171 mothers and 116 fathers) of children with oral clefts. Parents completed validated psychosocial instruments to measure social avoidance and distress, fear of negative evaluation scale, self-esteem and interpersonal support. Regression analysis was used to evaluate how selected child, parent and household characteristics relate to psychosocial outcomes focusing on child's cleft type, sex and age, differences between mothers and fathers, marital status and household income.\nRESULTS: Fathers had higher self-esteem than mothers (P\u2009=\u20090.01) and lower concern of being negatively judged by others (P\u2009<\u20090.0001) but also had lower perception of having someone to talk to about their problems (P\u2009=\u20090.01). High household income was associated with greater self-esteem and perception of social support (<0.05). Parents of male affected children had greater perception of social support than parents of female affected children (P\u2009=\u20090.04). No significant differences in parental psychosocial status measures were found by cleft type. Similarly, there is little evidence of changes with child age, except for an increase in parental distress and decline in self-esteem during mid-adolescence (age 15-17\u2009years).\nCONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that mothers and fathers of children with oral clefts may differ in their psychosocial adjustment and that mothers may overall experience more psychosocial problems than fathers. Also, parents from less wealthy households may be at greater risk. Parental psychosocial status should be considered in holistic family-based treatment approaches to reduce burden on affected families and improve their well-being.",

After adjusting for depressive symptoms and motor functioning, individuals estimated to be closest to HD diagnosis displayed higher levels of across- and within-task variability when compared to controls and those prodromal HD participants far from disease onset (F ICV(3,877)=11.25; p<.0001; F PacedTiming(3,877)=22.89; p<.0001).

        "abstract": "RCI2 / PMP3 s participate in abiotic stress responses and impact the expression of other genes. Their multifunctionality is determined by differential expression and by distinct activities of their structurally different proteins. In plants, RCI2/PMP3 genes, which encode small membrane proteins of the PMP3 family, are closely associated with abiotic stress responses. Their involvement in mediating stress tolerance is supported by genetic evidence and overexpression studies. RCI2/PMP3s occur as multigenes in plant genomes and their encoded proteins belong to distinct and conserved structural groups. In addition, different isoforms appear to be targeted to the plasma membrane or to distinct endomembrane compartments in cells. Several studies have revealed that RCI2/PMP3 proteins participate in cell ion homeostasis, and in regulation of membrane stability and polarization. They also appear to potentiate plant transcriptional responses to abiotic stresses. However, their mechanisms of action remain unknown. This paper reviews the current knowledge of the multiple roles of plant RCI2/PMP3 genes resulting from their differential expression under normal and stress conditions. The structural diversity of RCI2/PMP3 proteins is analyzed and evidence supporting their functional specialization and possible activity mechanisms is examined. Finally, strategies are discussed for exploiting new and established technologies to overcome the difficulties posed by the multigene status of RCI2s and the integral membrane character of their proteins, enabling the probing of their individual functions and collective significance.",

Broadly, HNPCC may be dichotomized into conditions that demonstrate defective DNA MMR and microsatellite instability (MSI) vs those conditions that demonstrate intact DNA MMR. Conditions characterized by MMR deficient CRCs include Lynch syndrome (germline MMR mutation), Lynch-like syndrome (biallelic somatic MMR mutations), constitutional MMR deficiency syndrome (biallelic germline MMR mutations), and sporadic MSI CRC (somatic biallelic methylation of MLH1). HNPCC conditions with intact DNA MMR associated with familial CRC include polymerase proofreading associated polyposis and familial colorectal cancer type X. Although next generation sequencing technologies have elucidated the genetic cause for some HNPCC conditions, others remain genetically undefined. Differentiating between Lynch syndrome and the other HNPCC disorders has profound implications for cancer risk assessment and surveillance of affected patients and their at-risk relatives. Clinical suspicion coupled with molecular tumor analysis and testing for germline mutations can help differentiate the clinical mimicry within HNPCC and facilitate diagnosis and management.",

        "abstract": "Most exposure assessments are conducted without the aid of robust personal exposure data and are based instead on qualitative inputs such as education and experience, training, documentation on the process chemicals, tasks and equipment, and other information. Qualitative assessments determine whether there is any follow-up, and influence the type that occurs, such as quantitative sampling, worker training, and implementing exposure and risk management measures. Accurate qualitative exposure judgments ensure appropriate follow-up that in turn ensures appropriate exposure management. Studies suggest that qualitative judgment accuracy is low. A qualitative exposure assessment Checklist tool was developed to guide the application of a set of heuristics to aid decision making. Practicing hygienists (n = 39) and novice industrial hygienists (n = 8) were recruited for a study evaluating the influence of the Checklist on exposure judgment accuracy. Participants generated 85 pre-training judgments and 195 Checklist-guided judgments. Pre-training judgment accuracy was low (33%) and not statistically significantly different from random chance. A tendency for IHs to underestimate the true exposure was observed. Exposure judgment accuracy improved significantly (p <0.001) to 63% when aided by the Checklist. Qualitative judgments guided by the Checklist tool were categorically accurate or over-estimated the true exposure by one category 70% of the time. The overall magnitude of exposure judgment precision also improved following training. Fleiss' \u03ba, evaluating inter-rater agreement between novice assessors was fair to moderate (\u03ba = 0.39). Cohen's weighted and unweighted \u03ba were good to excellent for novice (0.77 and 0.80) and practicing IHs (0.73 and 0.89), respectively. Checklist judgment accuracy was similar to quantitative exposure judgment accuracy observed in studies of similar design using personal exposure measurements, suggesting that the tool could be useful in developing informed priors and further demonstrating its usefulness in producing accurate qualitative exposure judgments.",

A total of 62 SNP and 6 CNV assays were evaluable after removing the variants, which were homozygous in (nearly) all samples. For sirolimus, rs2032582 (ABCB1) T-carriers versus non-T-carriers were associated with higher blood levels (P\u00a0= .01), with similar results for C/D ratio. Generalized estimating equation analysis supported these findings. For tacrolimus, rs776746 CYP3A5*3/*3 and CYP3A5*3/*1 were associated with higher blood levels than CYP3A5*1/*1 (P\u00a0= .002). By multivariable analysis, rs776746 CYP3A5*3/*3 and CYP3A5*3/*1 were independently associated with decreased acute GVHD compared with CYP3A5*1/*1, after adjustment for conditioning, donor type, race/ethnicity, and age. We demonstrated association of specific ADME genetic polymorphisms with blood levels of tacrolimus/sirolimus, and incidence of acute GVHD after HCT, in spite of TDM and dose adjustment. A larger ongoing study will determine whether these associations have clinical utility beyond TDM.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)-associated pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a well-known complication of prematurity; however, the additional impact of a left-to-right interatrial shunt on this condition remains poorly understood. The aim of the present study was to identify the significance of atrial left-to-right shunt lesions in PH infants with moderate or severe BPD.\nMETHODS: The medical records of 383 preterm infants (gestational age of < 32 weeks) who were diagnosed with BPD between 2005 and 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. Baseline characteristics such as interatrial shunts and outcomes were compared between the infants who developed PH (n = 50) and infants who did not (n = 144). Infants with hemodynamically significant residual patent ductus arteriosus were excluded. Among the infants diagnosed with PH (n = 50), the outcomes were compared between the patients with (n = 21) and without atrial shunts (n = 29) at 36 weeks corrected postmenstrual age.\nRESULTS: Fifty (15%) preterm infants with BPD were diagnosed with PH. The number of infants with a history of atrial shunt lesions was significantly higher in the PH group than in the non-PH group (42% vs. 15.3%, respectively). The adjusted odds ratio for PH in the atrial shunt group was 3.8 (95% confidence interval, 1.8-8.0), compared to PH-BPD infants without an atrial shunt.\nCONCLUSION: The presence of an atrial left-to-right shunt was associated with PH in preterm infants with moderate or severe BPD. Close follow up is needed for infants with interatrial shunts, and a more tailored prognostic evaluation and treatment are recommended.",

The novel IdyllaTMBRAF Mutation Test has high sensitivity and shorter turnaround times compared to other methods. We used Idylla to detect BRAF V600 mutations in archived formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor samples and compared these results with those obtained using the cobas 4800 BRAF V600 Mutation Test or MiSeq deep sequencing system and with those obtained by a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified laboratory employing polymerase chain reaction-based sequencing, mass spectrometric detection, or next-generation sequencing. In one set of 60 FFPE tumor samples (15 with BRAF mutations per Idylla), the Idylla and cobas results had an agreement of 97%. Idylla detected BRAF V600 mutations in two additional samples. The Idylla and MiSeq results had 100% concordance. In a separate set of 100 FFPE tumor samples (64 with BRAF mutation per Idylla), the Idylla and CLIA-certified laboratory results demonstrated an agreement of 96% even though the tests were not performed simultaneously and different FFPE blocks had to be used for 9 cases. The IdyllaTMBRAF Mutation Test produced results quickly (sample to results time was about 90 minutes with about 2 minutes of hands on time) and the closed nature of the cartridge eliminates the risk of PCR contamination. In conclusion, our observations demonstrate that the Idylla test is rapid and has high concordance with other routinely used but more complex BRAF mutation-detecting tests.",

        "abstract": "Although a higher protein intake, particularly from vegetable sources, has been shown to be associated with higher bone mineral density (BMD) the relative impact of specific amino acids on BMD and risk of osteoporosis remains to be determined. Mechanistic research suggests that a number of specific amino acids, including five nonessential amino acids--alanine, arginine, glutamic acid, glycine, and proline--may play a role in bone health, principally through improved production of insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 and the synthesis of collagen and muscle protein. However to date, no previous studies have examined the associations between habitual intake of amino acids and direct measures of BMD and prevalence of osteoporosis or osteopenia, and no studies have examined this relationship in discordant identical twin-pairs. In these analyses of female monozygotic twin-pairs discordant for amino acid intake (n = 135), twins with higher intakes of alanine and glycine had significantly higher BMD at the spine than their co-twins with within-pair differences in spine-BMD of 0.012 g/cm(2) (SE 0.01; p = 0.039) and 0.014 g/cm(2) (SE 0.01; p = 0.026), respectively. Furthermore, in cross-sectional multivariable analyses of 3160 females aged 18 to 79 years, a higher intake of total protein was significantly associated with higher DXA-measured BMD at the spine (quartile Q4 to quartile Q1: 0.017 g/cm(2), SE 0.01, p = 0.035) and forearm (Q4 to Q1: 0.010 g/cm(2), SE 0.003, p = 0.002). Intake of six amino acids (alanine, arginine, glutamic acid, leucine, lysine, and proline) were associated with higher BMD at the spine and forearm with the strongest association observed for leucine (Q4 to Q1: 0.024 g/cm(2), SE 0.01, p = 0.007). When intakes were stratified by protein source, vegetable or animal, prevalence of osteoporosis or osteopenia was 13% to 19% lower comparing extreme quartiles of vegetable intake for five amino acids (not glutamic acid or proline). These data provide evidence to suggest that intake of protein and several amino acids, including alanine and glycine, may be beneficial for bone health, independent of genetic background.",

In recent years, there has been a proliferation of health IT applications such as outpatient portals. Rigorous evaluation is fundamental to ensure effectiveness and sustainability, as resistance to more widespread adoption of outpatient portals may be due to lack of user friendliness. Health IT applications that integrate with the existing electronic health record and present information in a condensed, user-friendly format could improve coordination of\u00a0care and communication. Importantly, these applications should be developed systematically with appropriate methodological design and testing to ensure usefulness, adoption, and sustainability. Based on our prior work that identified numerous information needs and challenges of HCT, we developed an experimental prototype of a health IT tool, the BMT Roadmap. Our goal was to develop a tool that could be used in the real-world, daily practice of HCT patients and caregivers (users) in the inpatient setting. Herein, we examined the views, needs, and wants of users in the design and development process of the BMT Roadmap through user-centered Design Groups. Three important themes emerged: 1) perception of core features as beneficial (views), 2)\u00a0alerting the design team to potential issues with the user interface (needs); and 3) providing a deeper understanding of the user experience in terms of wider psychosocial requirements (wants). These findings resulted in changes that led to an improved, functional BMT Roadmap product, which will be tested as an intervention in the pediatric HCT population in the fall of 2015 (ClinicalTrials.govNCT02409121).",

Overexpressing two defense-related genes (OsOXO4 and OsCHI11) cloned from rice is effective at enhancing resistance against sheath blight caused by Rhizoctonia solani. These genes were expressed under the control of two different green tissue-specific promoters, viz. maize phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase gene promoter, PEPC, and rice cis-acting 544-bp DNA element, immediately upstream of the D54O translational start site, P D54O-544 . Putative T0 transgenic rice plants were screened by PCR and integration of genes was confirmed by Southern hybridization of progeny (T1) rice plants. Successful expression of OsOXO4 and OsCHI11 in all tested plants was confirmed. Expression of PR genes increased significantly following pathogen infection in overexpressing transgenic plants. Following infection, transgenic plants exhibited elevated hydrogen peroxide levels, significant changes in activity of ROS scavenging enzymes and reduced membrane damage when compared to their wild-type counterpart. In a Rhizoctonia solani toxin assay, a detached leaf inoculation test and an in vivo plant bioassay, transgenic plants showed a significant reduction in disease symptoms in comparison to non-transgenic control plants. This is the first report of overexpression of two different PR genes driven by two green tissue-specific promoters providing enhanced sheath blight resistance in transgenic rice.",

Resistance to acetolactate synthase (ALS) and photosystem II inhibiting herbicides was confirmed in a population of allotetraploid annual bluegrass (Poa annua L.; POAAN-R3) selected from golf course turf in Tennessee. Genetic sequencing revealed that seven of eight POAAN-R3 plants had a point mutation in the psbA gene resulting in a known Ser-264-Gly substitution on the D1 protein. Whole plant testing confirmed that this substitution conferred resistance to simazine in POAAN-R3. Two homeologous forms of the ALS gene (ALSa and ALSb) were detected and expressed in all POAAN-R3 plants sequenced. The seven plants possessing the Ser-264-Gly mutation conferring resistance to simazine also had a homozygous Ala-205-Phe substitution on ALSb, caused by two nucleic acid substitutions in one codon. In vitro ALS activity assays with recombinant protein and whole plant testing confirmed that this Ala-205-Phe substitution conferred resistance to imidazolinone, sulfonylurea, triazolopyrimidines, sulfonylamino-carbonyl- triazolinones, and pyrimidinyl (thio) benzoate herbicides.

        "abstract": "Drug toxicity is a key issue for drug R&D, a fundamental challenge of which is to screen for the targets genome-wide. The anticancer tyrosine kinase inhibitor sunitinib is known to induce cardiotoxicity. Here, to understand the molecular insights of cardiotoxicity by sunitinib at the genome level, we used a genome-wide drug target screening technology (GPScreen) that measures drug-induced haploinsufficiency (DIH) in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe genome-wide deletion library and found a mitochondrial DNA polymerase (POG1). In the results, sunitinib induced more severe cytotoxicity and mitochondrial damage in POG1-deleted heterozygous mutants compared to wild type (WT) of S. pombe. Furthermore, knockdown of the human ortholog POLG of S. pombe POG1 in human cells significantly increased the cytotoxicity of sunitinib. Notably, sunitinib dramatically decreased the levels of POLG mRNAs and proteins, of which downregulation was already known to induce mitochondrial damage of cardiomyocytes, causing cardiotoxicity. These results indicate that POLG might play a crucial role in mitochondrial damage as a gene of which expressional pathway is targeted by sunitinib for cardiotoxicity, and that genome-wide drug target screening with GPScreen can be applied to drug toxicity target discovery to understand the molecular insights regarding drug toxicity.",

IL-1\u03b2 shortened the time to thrombosis in wild-type mice, while Psgl-1(-/-) mice were protected from the prothrombotic effects of IL-1\u03b2.

        "abstract": "Bacterial CRISPR-Cas systems provide insight into recent population history because they rapidly incorporate, in a unidirectional manner, short fragments (spacers) from coexisting infective virus populations into host chromosomes. Immunity is achieved by sequence identity between transcripts of spacers and their targets. Here, we used metagenomics to study the stability and dynamics of the type I-E CRISPR-Cas locus of Leptospirillum group II bacteria in biofilms sampled over 5 years from an acid mine drainage (AMD) system. Despite recovery of 452,686 spacers from CRISPR amplicons and metagenomic data, rarefaction curves of spacers show no saturation. The vast repertoire of spacers is attributed to phage/plasmid population diversity and retention of old spacers, despite rapid evolution of the targeted phage/plasmid genome regions (proto-spacers). The oldest spacers (spacers found at the trailer end) are conserved for at least 5 years, and 12% of these retain perfect or near-perfect matches to proto-spacer targets. The majority of proto-spacer regions contain an AAG proto-spacer adjacent motif (PAM). Spacers throughout the locus target the same phage population (AMDV1), but there are blocks of consecutive spacers without AMDV1 target sequences. Results suggest long-term coexistence of Leptospirillum with AMDV1 and periods when AMDV1 was less dominant. Metagenomics can be applied to millions of cells in a single sample to provide an extremely large spacer inventory, allow identification of phage/plasmids and enable analysis of previous phage/plasmid exposure.

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Tobacco smoking is a leading cause of mortality in developed and developing countries. Despite antitobacco and smoke-free policies, the prevalence of active smokers in Mexican urban populations has remained stable. Mexican smokers differ from Caucasian and other ethnic groups, probably due to sociocultural and genetic background characteristics. This study explored the effect of known genetic variants on smoking behavior in Mexico City residents.\nMETHODS: Three hundred sixty-four Mexican Mestizo Mexico City residents from 87 families with at least one smoker were assessed for association of 12 gene variants of six candidate genes (CHRNA4, CHRNB2, DRD2, ANKK1, SLC6A3, and CYP2A6) with cigarette consumption, age of initiation and smoking duration. The Family Based Association Test, an extension of the Transmission Disequilibrium Test, was used to perform family-based association analysis.\nRESULTS: The Family Based Association Test showed statistically significant association between the rs2072658 polymorphism of the CHRNB2 gene and smoking-related phenotypes such as: smoking status (SS), age of onset (AO), years of smoking, and psychological dependence (PD) evaluated by the Glover-Nilsson Smoking Behavior Questionnaire. After Bonferroni correction, only the association with AO remained significant (P = .003). Statistically significant association was also observed for the CYP2A6 rs28399433 T allele with SS (P = .003) and PD (P = .003).\nCONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate effects of the rs2072658 CHRNB2 and rs28399433 CYP2A6 gene variants on AO, SS and PD in Mexican Mestizo smokers. A mild effect of other analyzed gene variants, which may contribute to a putative polygenic predisposition for smoking, is suggested.\nIMPLICATIONS: The understanding of genetic and environmental determinants in the Mexican population is important for other Latin American populations as well, living in their own countries or moving to other ones, particular due to the current migration characteristics and particular genetic background like the Mexican Mestizo and other Central American populations with similar characteristics and migrating to neighbor developed countries, introducing their own smoking behavior and contributing importantly to the genetic pool of the receptor country.",

        "abstract": "This paper provides new insights into source-sink relationships and transpiration processes which will eventually help to interpret \u03b4 (18) O as a genotype selection and ecophysiological tool for maize adaptation to drought. Oxygen isotope composition (\u03b4(18)O) has been proposed as a phenotyping tool to integrate leaf transpiration in C4 crops, such as maize. Within this context we hypothesize that \u03b4(18)O in leaves may reflect primarily environmental and genetic variability in evaporative processes, but that this signal may become dampened in transit from source to sink tissues. The aim of this study was to assess the relative importance of transpirative or translocation-related factors affecting \u03b4(18)O in plant tissues of maize. We performed two water regime experiments, one with two varieties under semi-controlled conditions, and another in the field with 100 genotypes during two consecutive years. The \u03b4(18)O in organic matter at the leaf base was strongly correlated with the \u03b4(18)O in stem water, indicating that it could be a good proxy for source water in extensive samplings. Compared to leaves, we observed an (18)O depletion in silks and grains, but not in stem-soluble organic matter. We interpret this as evidence of exchange with unenriched water from source to sink, but mainly occurring within sink tissues. Although grain yield (GY) and physiological variables did not show clear intra-trial patterns against \u03b4(18)O, the only tissues that correlated with GY in the linear regression approach were that of silks, giving an insight of evapotranspirative demand during female flowering and thus of potential maize lines that are better adapted to drought. This finding will eventually help to interpret \u03b4(18)O as a genotype selection and ecophysiological tool for the adaption of maize and other crops to drought, offering insight into source-sink relationships and transpiration processes.",

Seventeen other Xanthomonas isolates, including closely related Xanthomonas vasicola, other bacterial pathogens/endophytes of Musa and two healthy Musa varieties gave negative results with the LAMP assay. The assay showed good sensitivity, detecting as little as 51\u00a0fg of Xcm DNA, a greater level of sensitivity than that of an Xcm PCR assay. Amplification with the LAMP assay was very rapid, typically within 9\u00a0min from bacterial cultures.

To evaluate the effect of storage time on the chromosomal radiosensitivity assessment in lymphocytes, micronuclei (MN) yields in blood samples received and processed on the same day were compared with MN yields obtained when blood cultures were set up 24 and 48h after blood sampling. Furthermore, the influence of general anaesthesia on MN and binucleated cells (BN) yields in the MN assay was considered. Blood samples of 10 healthy donors were irradiated and blood cultures were set up during the same day of blood sampling or with a delay of 24 or 48h. The MN assay was also performed on two blood samples from 60 women undergoing breast surgery. The first blood sample was taken before general anaesthesia and the second sample, 2h after anaesthesia induction. Fifty percent of the blood samples were transported to the cytogenetics lab within 2h while the other 50% reached the lab after 24h. The results of this study show a decrease in BN and an increase in MN yields with increasing storage time before irradiation and setting up of the MN assay for both healthy controls and patients. The administration of general anaesthesia in patients resulted in lower BN yields, higher spontaneous MN yields but no differences in radiation-induced MN yields. In conclusion, this study indicates that the time between blood sampling and the in vitro irradiation of the samples for the MN assay influences the MN yields. Delays of more than 24h should be avoided. To assess chromosomal radiosensitivity in patients, blood samples should be taken before induction of general anaesthesia as anaesthesia can have an impact on the reliability of the MN results.",

Based on microarray, TNF and IL6 were among the most highly upregulated genes in both stimulated conditions, each of which was significantly inhibited by preincubation with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). In contrast, following stimulation of macrophages with either TNF-\u03b1 or IFN-\u03b1, which do not signal through TLR, the resultant gene expression was refractory to HCQ. Ligation of TLR7/8 resulted in increased histone methylation as measured by increased H3K4me2, a requirement for binding of NF-\u03baB at certain promoters, specifically the kB1 region in the TNF promoter (ChIP-qPCR), which was significantly decreased by HCQ. In summary, these results support that the HCQ-sensitive phenotype of hY3 stimulated macrophages reflects the bifurcation of TLR downstream signals involving NF-\u03baB and STAT 1 pathways and for the former dimethylation of H3K4. Accordingly, HCQ may act more as a preventive measure in downregulating the initial production of IFN-\u03b1 or TNF-\u03b1 and not affect the resultant autocoid stimulation reflected in TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b1 responsive genes. The beneficial scope of antimalarials in the prevention of organ damage, inclusive of heart block in an anti-Ro offspring or more broadly SLE, may include in part, a mechanism targeting TLR-dependent epigenetic modification.",

        "abstract": "In this manuscript, we expand upon sociological research in lay knowledge about health and healthicization by examining socially mediated ways in which 40 African American adults in two communities acquired information about eating practices. Participants employed a variety of socially informed information-seeking strategies. Many, but not all, used socially prescribed sources exhorting them to maximize their own health and reported an amalgam of experiences concerning their interpretation of healthist messages. Participants variously accepted messages about healthy eating or engaged in strategies of micro-resistance that decentered and/or reinterpreted health promotion discourse. Furthermore, participants used emic community-based resources including those that prioritized familial engagement over individual responsibility in eating practices or that drew upon alternative health practices. We discuss the implications our work has for further research on healthicization and lay knowledge about eating practices, in which community members are actively engaged in meaning-making within local socio-structural contexts.",

        "abstract": "High-throughput technologies such as next-generation genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics are capable of generating massive amounts of data quickly, and at relatively low costs. It is tempting to use this data for various medical applications including preclinical disease detection and for prediction of disease predisposition. Pilot projects, initiated by various research groups and Google, are currently underway, but results with not be available for a few years. We here summarize some possible difficulties with these approaches, by using examples from already tried cancer and other screening programs. Population screening, especially with multiparametric algorithms, will identify at least some false positive parameters and screening programs will identify abnormal results in otherwise healthy individuals. Whole genome sequencing will identify genetic changes of unknown significance and may not predict accurately future disease predisposition if the disease is also influenced by environmental factors. In screening programs, if the disease is rare, the positive predictive value of the test will be low, even if the test has excellent sensitivity and specificity. False positive results may require invasive procedures to delineate. Furthermore, screening programs are not effective if the cancer grows quickly, and will identify indolent forms of the disease with slow-growing tumors. It has also been recently shown that for some cancers, more intensive and radical treatments do not usually lead to better clinical outcomes. We conclude that new omics testing technologies should avoid overdiagnosis and overtreatment and need to be evaluated for overall clinical benefit before introduction to the clinic.",

        "abstract": "The increased incidence of solar ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation has been proposed as an environmental stressor, which may help to explain the enigmatic decline of amphibian populations worldwide. Despite growing knowledge regarding the UV-induced biological effects in several amphibian models, little is known about the efficacy of DNA repair pathways. In addition, little attention has been given to the interplay between these molecular mechanisms with other physiological strategies that avoid the damage induced by sunlight. Here, DNA lesions induced by environmental doses of solar UVB and UVA radiation were detected in genomic DNA samples of treefrog tadpoles (Hypsiboas pulchellus) and their DNA repair activity was evaluated. These data were complemented by monitoring the induction of apoptosis in blood cells and tadpole survival. Furthermore, the tadpoles' ability to perceive and escape from UV wavelengths was evaluated as an additional strategy of photoprotection. The results show that tadpoles are very sensitive to UVB light, which could be explained by the slow DNA repair rates for both cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and pyrimidine (6,4) pyrimidone photoproducts (6,4PPs). However, they were resistant to UVA, probably as a result of the activation of photolyases during UVA irradiation. Surprisingly, a sensory mechanism that triggers their escape from UVB and UVA light avoids the generation of DNA damage and helps to maintain the genomic integrity. This work demonstrates the genotoxic impact of both UVB and UVA radiation on tadpoles and emphasizes the importance of the interplay between molecular and sensory mechanisms to minimize the damage caused by sunlight.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical activity, safety and predictive biomarkers of dacomitinib, an irreversible pan-HER inhibitor, in patients with recurrent or metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (R/M-ESCC). Patients, whose diseases were not amenable to curative treatment and had progressed on platinum-based chemotherapy, were treated with dacomitinib 45 mg/day. The primary endpoint was objective response rate by RECISTv 1.1. Predictive biomarker analyses included the characterization of somatic mutations and gene expression using the Ion Torrent AmpliSeq Cancer Hotspot Panel and Nanostring nCounter, and investigation of their relationship with clinical outcomes. Of the 48 evaluable patients, 6 (12.5%) achieved partial responses and 29 (60.4%) had stable disease. The median response duration was 7.1 months. The median progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) was 3.3 months (95% CI, 2.4-4.3 months) and 6.4 months (95% CI, 4.4-8.4 months). Adverse events were mostly grade 1-2. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed that ERBB signaling pathway is significantly enriched in patients with PFS \u2265 4 months (n = 12) than PFS < 4 months (n = 21) (p < 0.001). Upregulation of ERBB signaling pathway was significantly associated with longer PFS (5.0 vs. 2.9 months, P = 0.016) and OS (10.0 vs. 4.8 months, P = 0.022). The most frequent mutations were TP53 (61%) followed by CDKN2A (8%), MLH1 (8%), FLT3 (8%) and EGFR (8%). Dacomitinib demonstrated clinical efficacy with manageable toxicity in platinum-failed R/M-ESCC. Screening of ERBB pathway-related gene expression profiles may help identify patients who are most likely benefit from dacomitinib.",

A large number of QTLs attributed to grain productivity and other agriculturally important traits have been identified and deposited in public repositories. The integration of fruitful QTL becomes a major issue in current plant genomics. To this end, we first collected QTL for six agriculturally important traits in maize, including yield, plant height, ear height, leaf angle, stay-green, and maize rough dwarf disease resistance. The meta-analysis method was then employed to retrieve 113 meta-QTL. Additionally, we also isolated candidate genes for target traits by the bioinformatic technique. Several candidates, including some well-characterized genes, GA3ox2 for plant height, lg1 and lg4 for leaf angle, zfl1 and zfl2 for flowering time, were co-localized with established meta-QTL intervals. Intriguingly, in a relatively narrow meta-QTL region, the maize ortholog of rice yield-related gene GW8/OsSPL16 was believed to be a candidate for yield. Leveraging results presented in this study will provide further insights into the genetic architecture of maize agronomic traits. Moreover, the meta-QTL and candidate genes reported here could be harnessed for the enhancement of stress tolerance and yield performance in maize and translation to other crops.",

        "abstract": "The endocrine system has profound regulatory effects within the human body and thus the ability to control and maintain appropriate function within many physiological systems (i.e., homeostasis). The hormones associated with the endocrine system utilize autocrine, paracrine, or endocrine actions on the cells of their target tissues within these physiologic systems to adjust homeostasis. The introduction of exercise as a stressor to disrupt homeostasis can greatly amplify and impact the actions of these hormones. To that end, the endocrine response to an acute exercise session occurs in a progression of phases with the magnitude of the response being relative to the exercise work intensity or volume. Various physiologic mechanisms are considered responsible for these responses, although not all are completely understood or elucidated. Chronic exercise training does not eliminate the acute exercise response but may attenuate the overall effect of the responsiveness as the body adapts in a positive fashion to the training stimulus. Regrettably, an excessive intensity and/or volume of training may lead to maladaptation and is associated with inappropriate endocrine hormonal responses. The mechanisms leading to a deleterious maladaptive state are not well understood and require additional research for elucidation.",

The condition itself and the underlying molecular mechanisms have not been elucidated.\nOBJECTIVE: To present the clinical manifestations, endocrinologic evaluation and transcriptomic profile in a patient with transient generalized glucocorticoid hypersensitivity.\nDESIGN AND RESULTS: A 9-year-old girl presented with an 8-month history of clinical manifestations suggestive of Cushing syndrome. Endocrinologic evaluation revealed undetectable 08:00 h ACTH (<1 pg/mL) and cortisol (0\u00b7025 \u03bcg/dL) concentrations, which remained decreased throughout the 24-h period and did not respond to stimulation with ovine CRH. The disease gradually resolved spontaneously over the ensuing 3 months. Sequencing of the human glucocorticoid receptor gene revealed no mutations or polymorphisms. Western blot analysis in peripheral blood mononuclear cells revealed equal protein expression of hGR\u03b1 of the patient in the disease and postresolution phases compared with a control subject. Transcriptomic analysis in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in the disease and postresolution phases identified 903 differentially expressed genes. Of these, 106 genes were up-regulated and 797 were down-regulated in the disease compared with the resolution phase. Bioinformatics analysis on the differentially expressed gene networks revealed Nuclear Factor-\u03baB as the predominant transcription factor influencing the expression of the majority of differentially expressed genes.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that a transient postreceptor defect, or a virus- or bacterium-encoded molecule, may have enhanced glucocorticoid signal transduction, leading to transient generalized glucocorticoid hypersensitivity and hypo-activation of the HPA axis.",

There are currently intense research efforts in the crop sciences to identify efficient CRISPR/Cas9 platforms to carry out targeted mutagenesis and gene editing projects. These efforts typically result in the incremental tweaking of various platform components including the identification of crop-specific promoters and terminators for optimal expression of the Cas9 enzyme and identification of promoters for expression of the CRISPR guide RNA. In this report, we demonstrate the development of an online web tool for fast identification of CRISPR/Cas9 target loci within soybean gene models, and generic DNA sequences. The web-tool described in this work can quickly identify a high number of potential CRISPR/Cas9 target sites, including restriction enzyme sites that can facilitate the detection of new mutations. In conjunction with the web tool, a soybean codon-optimized CRISPR/Cas9 platform was designed to direct double-stranded breaks to the targeted loci in hairy root transformed cells. The modified Cas9 enzyme was shown to successfully mutate target genes in somatic cells of 2 legume species, soybean and Medicago truncatula. These new tools may help facilitate targeted mutagenesis in legume and other plant species.",

It remains to be determined whether melanoma patients bearing mTOR mutation could be selected for treatment with PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway inhibitors.\nEXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A total of 412 melanoma samples were included. Gene aberrations in all exons of mTOR were detected by Sanger sequencing and confirmed by using Agilent's SureSelect Target Enrichment System. HEK293T cells stably expressing mTOR mutants were constructed by using transcription activator-like effector nucleases technique. Function of mTOR mutants and in vitro sensitivity of gain-of-function mTOR mutations to PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway inhibitors were analyzed.\nRESULTS: The overall incidence of somatic nonsynonymous mutations of mTOR was 10.4% (43/412). mTOR nonsynonymous mutations were relatively more frequent in acral (11.0%) and mucosal (14.3%) melanomas than in chronic sun-induced damage (CSD; 6.7%) and non-CSD (3.4%) melanomas. Of the 43 cases with mTOR mutations, 41 different mutations were detected, affecting 25 different exons. The median survival time for melanoma patients with mTOR nonsynonymous mutation was significantly shorter than that for patients without mTOR nonsynonymous mutation (P = 0.028). Transient expression of mTOR mutants in HEK293T cells strongly activated the mTOR-p70S6K pathway. In HEK293T cells with stable expression of H1968Y or P2213S mTOR mutants, LY294002 and AZD5363 showed higher potency than temsirolimus or BYL719 in inhibiting the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway and cell proliferation.\nCONCLUSIONS: mTOR nonsynonymous mutations are frequent in melanoma patients. mTOR nonsynonymous mutation may predict a worse prognosis of melanoma. Clinical trials with PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway inhibitors may be beneficial for melanoma patients with specific mTOR mutations.",

Here we report the development and successful clinical application of a generic CF-PGD protocol to facilitate direct detection of any CFTR nucleotide variation(s) by HRMA and simultaneous confirmation of diagnosis through haplotype analysis.\nMETHODS: A multiplex PCR was optimized supporting co-amplification of any CFTR exon-region, along with 6 closely linked STRs. Single cell genotypes were established through HRM analysis following melting of the 2nd round PCR products and were confirmed by STR haplotype analysis of the 1st PCR products. The protocol was validated pre-clinically, by testing 208 single lymphocytes, isolated from whole blood samples from 4 validation family trios. Fifteen PGD cycles were performed and 103 embryos were biopsied.\nRESULTS: In 15 clinical PGD cycles, genotypes were achieved in 88/93 (94.6%) embryo biopsy samples, of which 57/88 (64.8%) were deemed genetically suitable for embryo transfer. Amplification failed at all loci for 10/103 blastomeres biopsied from poor quality embryos. Six clinical pregnancies were achieved (2 twin, 4 singletons). PGD genotypes were confirmed following conventional amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling in all achieved pregnancies.\nCONCLUSIONS: The single cell HRMA CF-PGD protocol described herein is a flexible, generic, low cost and robust genotyping method, which facilitates the analysis of any CFTR genotype combination.

We screened a cohort of 101 unrelated patients without a molecular diagnosis referred to the Reference Centre for Oro-Dental Manifestations of Rare Diseases, Strasbourg, France, for a variety of orodental disorders including isolated and syndromic amelogenesis imperfecta (AI), isolated and syndromic selective tooth agenesis (STHAG), isolated and syndromic dentinogenesis imperfecta, isolated dentin dysplasia, otodental dysplasia and primary failure of tooth eruption.\nRESULTS: We discovered 21 novel pathogenic variants and identified the causative mutation in 39 unrelated patients in known genes (overall diagnostic rate: 39%).

It manifests histologically as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and carries a 33% risk of relapse in a renal transplant. No efficient treatment exists. Identification of single-gene (monogenic) causes of SRNS has moved the glomerular epithelial cell (podocyte) to the center of its pathogenesis. Recently, mutations in &gt;30 recessive or dominant genes were identified as causing monogenic forms of SRNS, thereby revealing the encoded proteins as essential for glomerular function. These findings helped define protein interaction complexes and functional pathways that could be targeted for treatment of SRNS. Very recently, it was discovered that in the surprisingly high fraction of \u223c30% of all individuals who manifest with SRNS before 25 years of age, a causative mutation can be detected in one of the \u223c30 different SRNS-causing genes. These findings revealed that SRNS and FSGS are not single disease entities but rather are part of a spectrum of distinct diseases with an identifiable genetic etiology. Mutation analysis should be offered to all individuals who manifest with SRNS before the age of 25 years, because (i) it will provide the patient and families with an unequivocal cause-based diagnosis, (ii) it may uncover a form of SRNS that is amenable to treatment (e.g. coenzyme Q<sub>10</sub>), (iii) it may allow avoidance of a renal biopsy procedure, (iv) it will further unravel the puzzle of pathogenic pathways of SRNS and (v) it will permit personalized treatment options for SRNS, based on genetic causation in way of 'precision medicine'.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Despite advances in molecular medicine over recent decades, there has been little advancement in the treatment of osteosarcoma. We performed comprehensive molecular profiling in two cases of metastatic and chemotherapy-refractory osteosarcoma to guide molecularly targeted therapy.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: Hybridization capture of >300 cancer-related genes plus introns from 28 genes often rearranged or altered in cancer was applied to >50 ng of DNA extracted from tumor samples from two patients with recurrent, metastatic osteosarcoma. The DNA from each sample was sequenced to high, uniform coverage. Immunohistochemical probes and morphoproteomics analysis were performed, in addition to fluorescence in situ hybridization. All analyses were performed in CLIA-certified laboratories. Molecularly targeted therapy based on the resulting profiles was offered to the patients. Biomedical analytics were performed using QIAGEN's Ingenuity\u00ae Pathway Analysis.\nRESULTS: In Patient #1, comprehensive next-generation exome sequencing showed MET amplification, PIK3CA mutation, CCNE1 amplification, and PTPRD mutation. Immunohistochemistry-based morphoproteomic analysis revealed c-Met expression [(p)-c-Met (Tyr1234/1235)] and activation of mTOR/AKT pathway [IGF-1R (Tyr1165/1166), p-mTOR [Ser2448], p-Akt (Ser473)] and expression of SPARC and COX2. Targeted therapy was administered to match the P1K3CA, c-MET, and SPARC and COX2 aberrations with sirolimus+ crizotinib and abraxane+ celecoxib. In Patient #2, aberrations included NF2 loss in exons 2-16, PDGFR\u03b1 amplification, and TP53 mutation. This patient was enrolled on a clinical trial combining targeted agents temsirolimus, sorafenib and bevacizumab, to match NF2, PDGFR\u03b1 and TP53 aberrations. Both the patients did not benefit from matched therapy.\nCONCLUSIONS: Relapsed osteosarcoma is characterized by complex signaling and drug resistance pathways. Comprehensive molecular profiling holds great promise for tailoring personalized therapies for cancer. Methods for such profiling are evolving and need to be refined to better assist clinicians in making treatment decisions based on the large amount of data that results from this type of testing. Further research in this area is warranted.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Family history provides important information on risk of developing inflammatory bowel disease [IBD], and genetic profiling of first-degree relatives [FDR] of Crohn's disease [CD]- affected individuals might provide additional information. We aimed to delineate the genetic contribution to the increased IBD susceptibility observed in FDR.\nMETHODS: N = 976 Caucasian, healthy, non-related FDR; n = 4997 independent CD; and n = 5000 healthy controls [HC]; were studied. Genotyping for 158 IBD-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs] was performed using the Illumina Immunochip. Risk allele frequency [RAF] differences between FDR and HC cohorts were correlated with those between CD and HC cohorts. CD and IBD genetic risk scores [GRS] were calculated and compared between HC, FDR, and CD cohorts.\nRESULTS: IBD-associated SNP RAF differences in FDR and HC cohorts were strongly correlated with those in CD and HC cohorts, correlation coefficient 0.63 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.53 - 0.72), p = 9.90 x 10(-19). There was a significant increase in CD-GRS [mean] comparing HC, FDR, and CD cohorts: 0.0244, 0.0250, and 0.0257 respectively [p < 1.00 x 10(-7) for each comparison]. There was no significant difference in the IBD-GRS between HC and FDR cohorts [p = 0.81]; however, IBD-GRS was significantly higher in CD compared with FDR and HC cohorts [p < 1.00 x 10(-10) for each comparison].\nCONCLUSION: FDR of CD-affected individuals are enriched with IBD risk alleles compared with HC. Cumulative CD-specific genetic risk is increased in FDR compared with HC. Prospective studies are required to determine if genotyping would facilitate better risk stratification of FDR.",

We aimed to investigate the biological and psychosocial risk factors associated with PMD compared with other psychotic disorders.\nMETHODS: Based on the aetiology and ethnicity in schizophrenia and other psychoses (\u00c6SOP) study, we used a case-control study to identify and recruit, at baseline and 10-year follow-up, all first episode cases of psychosis, presenting for the first time to specialist mental health services in defined catchment areas in the UK. Population-based controls were recruited from the same areas. Data were collected on: sociodemographics; social isolation; childhood adversity; life events; minor physical anomalies; and neurological soft signs.\nRESULTS: Living alone (aOR\u00a0=\u00a02.26, CI\u00a0=\u00a01.21-4.23), basic level qualification (aOR\u00a0=\u00a02.89, CI\u00a0=\u00a01.08-7.74), being unemployed (aOR\u00a0=\u00a02.12, CI\u00a0=\u00a01.13-3.96), having contact with friends less than monthly (aOR\u00a0=\u00a04.24, CI\u00a0=\u00a01.62-11.14), having no close confidants (aOR\u00a0=\u00a04.71, CI\u00a0=\u00a02.08-10.68), having experienced childhood adversity (aOR\u00a0=\u00a02.57, CI\u00a0=\u00a01.02-6.44), family history of mental illness (aOR\u00a0=\u00a010.68, CI\u00a0=\u00a05.06-22.52), family history of psychosis (aOR\u00a0=\u00a012.85, CI\u00a0=\u00a05.24-31.51), and having more neurological soft signs (aOR\u00a0=\u00a01.15, CI\u00a0=\u00a01.07-1.24) were all associated with a follow-up diagnosis of PMD and schizophrenia. Few variables associated with PMD were also associated with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. Minor physical anomalies were associated with a follow-up diagnosis of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, but not PMD.\nCONCLUSIONS: Risk factors associated with PMD appear to overlap with those for schizophrenia, but less so for bipolar disorder. Future work on the differential aetiology of PMD, from other psychoses is needed to find the 'specifier' between PMD and other psychoses. Future research on aetiology in PMD, and perhaps other psychoses, should account for diagnostic change.",

        "abstract": "Decorin is a prototypical small leucine-rich proteoglycan that epitomizes the multifunctional nature of this critical gene family. Soluble decorin engages multiple receptor tyrosine kinases within the target-rich environment of the tumor stroma and tumor parenchyma. Upon receptor binding, decorin initiates signaling pathways within endothelial cells downstream of VEGFR2 that ultimately culminate in a Peg3/Beclin 1/LC3-dependent autophagic program. Concomitant with autophagic induction, decorin blunts capillary morphogenesis and endothelial cell migration, thereby significantly compromising tumor angiogenesis. In parallel within the tumor proper, decorin binds multiple RTKs with high affinity, including Met, for a multitude of oncosuppressive functions including growth inhibition, tumor cell mitophagy, and angiostasis. Decorin is also pro-inflammatory by modulating macrophage function and cytokine secretion. Decorin suppresses tumorigenic growth, angiogenesis, and prevents metastatic lesions in a variety of in vitro and in vivo tumor models. Therefore, decorin would be an ideal therapeutic candidate for combating solid malignancies.",

They triggered the transcription of limonene synthase and induced higher limonene production in seeds and fruits than CaMV 35S promoter. Camelina sativa (Camelina) is an oilseed crop of relevance for the production of biofuels and the plant has been target of a recent and intense program of genetic manipulation aimed to increase performance, seed yield and to modify the fatty acid composition of the oil. Here, we have explored the performance of two Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) promoters in triggering transgene expression in Camelina. The promoters of two genes BANYULS (AtBAN pro ) and FRUITFULL (AtFUL pro ), which are expressed in seed coat and valves\u00a0of Arabidopsis, respectively, have been chosen to induce the expression of limonene synthase (LS) from Citrus limon. In addition, the constitutive CaMV 35S promoter was utilized to overexpress LS in Camelina . The results of experiments revealed that AtBAN pro and AtFUL pro are actively transcribed in Camelina where they also retain specificity of expression in seeds and valves as previously observed in Arabidopsis. LS induced by AtBAN pro and AtFUL pro leads to higher limonene production in seeds and fruits than when the CaMV 35S was used to trigger the expression. In conclusion, the results of experiments indicate that AtBAN pro and AtFUL pro can be successfully utilized to induce the expression of the transgenes of interest in seeds and fruits of Camelina.",

We report a new concept for profiling BC molecular sub-types based on volatile organic compounds (VOCs). For this purpose, breath samples were collected from 276 female volunteers, including healthy, benign conditions, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and malignant lesions. Breath samples were analysed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and artificially intelligent nanoarray technology. Applying the non-parametric Wilcoxon/Kruskal-Wallis test, GC-MS analysis found 23 compounds that were significantly different (p < 0.05) in breath samples of BC patients with different molecular sub-types. Discriminant function analysis (DFA) of the nanoarray identified unique volatolomic signatures between cancer and non-cancer cases (83% accuracy in blind testing), and for the different molecular sub-types with accuracies ranging from 82 to 87%, sensitivities of 81 to 88% and specificities of 76 to 96% in leave-one-out cross-validation.

        "abstract": "Unfavourable nutritional conditions during the neonatal critical period can cause both acute metabolic disorders and severe metabolic syndromes in later life. These phenomena have been tightly related to the epigenetic modification controlling the balance between satiety and hunger in the hypothalamus. In the present study, we investigated epigenetic modification associated with both the fasting stress effects and the short-term resilience to fasting stress in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of chicks. Fasting for 24 h at 3 days of age (D) (i.e. D3) significantly increased global methylation at lysine 27 of histone 3 (H3K27) and its specific histone methyltransferase (HMT) expression level in the PVN. Because global methylation could not fully reveal the changes at specific genes, the regulation of the gene for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf), which was recently also found to have an anorexigenic effect, was evaluated as a potential target. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay analysis revealed that tri- (me3) and di-methylated (me2) H3K27 exhibited an instant (on D4 only) and latent increase (on both D11 and D41), respectively, at the putative promoter of Bdnf after 24 h of fasting on D3. This indicated that fasting could regulate energy-expenditure-related genes via modifying methylation at H3K27, which we suspected might be a protective mechanism for keeping the inner environment homeostatic. To test this hypothesis, a short-term repetitive fasting stress was applied to chickens, which were fasted for 24 h either on D10 only or on both D3 and D10. It was found that pre-existing fasting on D3 could induce a short-term fasting resilience, which rescued the reduction of Bdnf expression from future fasting on D10. We call this phenomenon the \u2018molecular memory\u2019, which was mainly conducted by HMTs and H3K27me2/me3 in the PVN. In conclusion, chicks respond to fasting with dynamic methylation at H3K27 in the PVN during the neonatal critical period. This allows the PVN to form a \u2018molecular memory\u2019, which keeps the individual inner environment homeostatic and resilient to future fasting over the short term.",

In this study, the evolution of artemisinin-resistant P. falciparum in Thailand was assessed by exploring mutations in the K13 locus believed to confer drug resistance phenotype. P. falciparum-infected blood samples were obtained from patients in eight provinces of Thailand over two decades (1991-2014; n = 904). Analysis of the K13 gene was performed by either sequencing the complete coding region (n = 259) or mutation-specific PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism method (n = 645). K13 mutations related to artesunate resistance were detected in isolates from Trat province bordering Cambodia in 1991, about 4 years preceding widespread deployment of ACT in Thailand and increased in frequency over time. Nonsynonymous nucleotide diversity exceeded synonymous nucleotide diversity in the propeller region of the K13 gene, supporting the hypothesis that this diversity was driven by natural selection. No single mutant appeared to be favoured in every population, and propeller-region mutants were rarely observed in linkage with each other in the same haplotype. On the other hand, there was a highly significant association between the occurrence of a propeller mutant and the insertion of two or three asparagines after residue 139 of K13. Whether this insertion plays a compensatory role for deleterious effects of propeller mutants on the function of the K13 protein requires further investigation. However, modification of duration of ACT from 2-day to 3-day regimens in 2008 throughout the country does not halt the increase in frequency of mutants conferring artemisinin resistance phenotype.",

Herein, we studied the population structure and genetic relatedness among 104 global C. auris isolates from India, South Africa and Brazil using multilocus sequence typing (MLST), amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) fingerprinting and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). RPB1, RPB2 and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and D1/D2 regions of the ribosomal DNA were sequenced for MLST. Further, genetic variation and proteomic assessment was carried out using AFLP and MALDI-TOF MS, respectively. Both MLST and AFLP typing clearly demarcated two major clusters comprising Indian and Brazilian isolates. However, the South African isolates were randomly distributed, suggesting different genotypes. MALDI-TOF MS spectral profiling also revealed evidence of geographical clustering but did not correlate fully with the genotyping methods. Notably, overall the population structure of C. auris showed evidence of geographical clustering by all the three techniques analysed. Antifungal susceptibility testing by the CLSI microbroth dilution method revealed that fluconazole had limited activity against 87% of isolates (MIC90, 64 mg/L). Also, MIC90 of AMB was 4 mg/L. Candida auris is emerging as an important yeast pathogen globally and requires reproducible laboratory methods for identification and typing.

        "abstract": "The importance of androgen receptor (AR) signaling is increasingly being recognized in breast cancer, which has elicited clinical trials aimed at assessing the efficacy of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for metastatic disease. In prostate cancer, resistance to ADT is frequently associated with the emergence of androgen-independent splice variants of the AR (AR variants, AR-Vs) that lack the LBD and are constitutively active. Women with breast cancer may be prone to a similar phenomenon. Herein, we show that in addition to the prototypical transcript, the AR gene produces a diverse range of AR-V transcripts in primary breast tumors. The most frequently and highly expressed variant was AR-V7 (exons 1/2/3/CE3), which was detectable at the mRNA level in > 50% of all breast cancers and at the protein level in a subset of ER\u03b1-negative tumors. Functionally, AR-V7 is a constitutively active and ADT-resistant transcription factor that promotes growth and regulates a transcriptional program distinct from AR in ER\u03b1-negative breast cancer cells. Importantly, we provide ex vivo evidence that AR-V7 is upregulated by the AR antagonist enzalutamide in primary breast tumors. These findings have implications for treatment response in the ongoing clinical trials of ADT in breast cancer.",

However, there is a clear recognition within the academic, care delivery and pharmaceutical/biotech communities that our current model of clinical trial discovery and development is no longer fit for purpose. Delivering transformative cancer care should increasingly be our mantra, rather than maintaining the status quo of, at best, the often miniscule incremental benefits that are observed with many current clinical trials. As we enter the era of precision medicine for personalised cancer care (precision and personalised medicine), it is important that we capture and utilise our greater understanding of the biology of disease to drive innovative approaches in clinical trial design and implementation that can lead to a step change in cancer care delivery. A number of advances have been practice changing (e.g. imatinib mesylate in chronic myeloid leukaemia, Herceptin in erb-B2-positive breast cancer), and increasingly we are seeing the promise of a number of newer approaches, particularly in diseases like lung cancer and melanoma. Targeting immune checkpoints has recently yielded some highly promising results. New algorithms that maximise the effectiveness of clinical trials, through for example a multi-stage, multi-arm type design are increasingly gaining traction. However, our enthusiasm for the undoubted advances that have been achieved are being tempered by a realisation that these new approaches may have significant cost implications. This article will address these competing issues, mainly from a European perspective, highlight the problems and challenges to healthcare systems and suggest potential solutions that will ensure that the cost/value rubicon is addressed in a way that allows stakeholders to work together to deliver optimal cost-effective cancer care, the benefits of which can be transferred directly to our patients.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Ventricular access devices (VAD) and ventriculosubgaleal shunts (VSGS) are currently both used as temporising devices to affect CSF drainage in neonatal posthaemorrhagic hydrocephalus (PHH), without clear evidence of superiority of either procedure. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we compared the VSGS and VAD regarding complication rates, ventriculoperitoneal shunt conversion and infection rates, and mortality and long-term disability.\nMETHODS: The review was registered with the PROSPERO international prospective register of systematic reviews (registration number CRD42015019750) and was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines.\nRESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The literature search of five databases identified 338 publications, of which 5 met the inclusion criteria. All were retrospective cohort studies (evidence class 3b and 4). A significantly lower proportion of patients with a VSGS required CSF tapping compared to patients with a VAD (log OR -4.43, 95% CI -6.14 to -2.72). No other significant differences between the VAD and VSGS were identified in their rates of infection (log OR 0.03, 95% CI -0.77 to 0.84), obstruction (log OR 1.25, 95% CI -0.21 to 2.71), ventriculoperitoneal shunt dependence (log OR -0.06, 95% CI -0.93 to 0.82), subsequent shunt infection (log OR 0.23, 95% CI -0.61 to 1.06), mortality (log OR 0.37, 95% CI -0.95 to 1.70) or long-term disability (p = 0.9). In all studies, there was a lack of standardised criteria, variations between surgeons in heterogeneous cohorts of limited sample size and a lack of neurodevelopmental follow-up. This affirms the importance of an ongoing multicentre, prospective pilot study comparing these two temporising procedures to enable a more robust comparison.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the feasibility of an online self-management application (OncoKompas) among cancer survivors. In OncoKompas, cancer survivors can monitor their quality of life (QOL) via participant reported outcomes (PROs) (\"Measure\"), which is followed by automatically generated individually tailored feedback (\"Learn\") and personalized advice on supportive care services (\"Act\").\nMETHODS: A pretest-posttest design was used, conducting a survey before providing access to OncoKompas, and 2 weeks after, followed by an interview by a nurse. Adoption was defined as the percentage of cancer survivors that agreed to participate in the study and returned the T0 questionnaire. Implementation was defined as the percentage of participants that actually used OncoKompas as intended (T1). General satisfaction was assessed based on the mean score of three study-specific questions: (1) general impression of OncoKompas, (2) the user-friendliness, and (3) the ability to use OncoKompas without assistance (10-point Likert scales). Furthermore, satisfaction was measured with the Net Promotor Scale (NPS).\nRESULTS: OncoKompas was feasible with an adoption grade of 64 %, an implementation grade of 75-91 %, a mean satisfaction score of 7.3, and a positive NPS (1.9). Sociodemographic and clinical factors and QOL were not associated with satisfaction. Several facilitators and barriers related to the feasibility of OncoKompas were identified.\nCONCLUSION: OncoKompas is considered feasible, but has to be further improved. In order to enhance feasibility and increase satisfaction, we have to balance the time it takes to use OncoKompas, measurement precision, and tailoring towards personalized advices.",

        "abstract": "Non-accidental injury (NAI) is a major medical concern in the United States. One of the challenges in evaluation of children with unexplained fractures is that genetic forms of bone fragility are one of the differential diagnoses. Infants who present with fractures with mild forms of osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) (OI type I or OI type IV), the most common genetic form of bone disease leading to fractures might be missed if clinical evaluation alone is used to make the diagnosis. Diagnostic clinical features (blue sclera, dentinogenesis imperfecta, Wormian bones on X-rays or positive family history) may not be present or apparent at the age of evaluation. The evaluating clinician faces the decision about whether genetic testing is necessary in certain NAI cases. In this review, we outline clinical presentations of mild OI and review the history of genetic testing for OI in the NAI versus OI setting. We summarize our data of molecular testing in the Collagen Diagnostic Laboratory (CDL) from 2008 to 2014 where NAI was noted on the request for DNA sequencing of COL1A1 and COL1A2. We provide recommendations for molecular testing in the NAI versus OI setting. First, DNA sequencing of COL1A1, COL1A2, and IFITM5 simultaneously and duplication/deletion testing is recommended. If a causative variant is not identified, in the absence of a pathologic clinical phenotype, no additional gene testing is indicated. If a VUS is found, parental segregation studies are recommended.",

        "abstract": "Upper respiratory illness is the most common reason for non-injury-related presentation to a sports medicine clinic, accounting for 35-65% of illness presentations. Recurrent or persistent respiratory illness can have a negative impact on health and performance of athletes undertaking high levels of strenuous exercise. The cause of upper respiratory symptoms (URS) in athletes can be uncertain but the majority of cases are related to common respiratory viruses, viral reactivation, allergic responses to aeroallergens and exercise-related trauma to the integrity of respiratory epithelial membranes. Bacterial respiratory infections are uncommon in athletes. Undiagnosed or inappropriately treated asthma and/or allergy are common findings in clinical assessments of elite athletes experiencing recurrent URS. High-performance athletes with recurrent episodes of URS should undergo a thorough clinical assessment to exclude underlying treatable conditions of respiratory inflammation. Identifying athletes at risk of recurrent URS is important in order to prescribe preventative clinical, training and lifestyle strategies. Monitoring secretion rates and falling concentrations of salivary IgA can identify athletes at risk of URS. Therapeutic interventions are limited by the uncertainty of the underlying cause of inflammation. Topical anti-inflammatory sprays can be beneficial for some athletes. Dietary supplementation with bovine colostrum, probiotics and selected antioxidants can reduce the incidence or severity of URS in some athletes. Preliminary studies on athletes prone to URS indicate a genetic predisposition to a pro-inflammatory response and a dysregulated anti-inflammatory cytokine response to intense exercise as a possible mechanism of respiratory inflammation. This review focuses on respiratory infections and inflammation in elite/professional athletes.",

        "abstract": "In Australia, saxitoxin production is strain dependent within the bloom-forming freshwater cyanobacterium Anabaena circinalis. Freshwater cyanobacteria are exposed to rapid fluctuations in environmental nutrient concentrations, and their adaption is vital for competition, succession and dominance. Two elements of environmental significance, phosphorus and sodium chloride, are proposed to play a role in bloom development and saxitoxin biosynthesis respectively. The aim of our study was to comparatively analyse the model saxitoxin-producing A. circinalis\u2005AWQC131C and non-toxic A. circinalis\u2005AWQC310F at the genomic level and proteomic level, in response to phosphate depletion and increased extracellular NaCl. When challenged, photosynthesis, carbon/nitrogen metabolisms, transcription/translation, oxidative stress and nutrient transport functional categories demonstrated the largest changes in protein abundance. In response to increased NaCl, SxtC, a protein conserved in all known saxitoxin biosynthetic pathways, was downregulated. Additionally, toxin quantification revealed a decrease in total saxitoxin and decarbomoyl-gonyautoxin2/3 content in response to the NaCl treatment. In response to phosphate depletion, the toxic and non-toxic strain displayed similar proteomic profiles, although the toxic strain did not alter the abundance of as many proteins as the non-toxic strain. These findings have important implications for the future, since response and adaption mechanisms are directly related to in situ dominance of cyanobacteria.",

Invasive NTHi isolates submitted to Public Health England from children of ages 1 month to 10 years during 2003-2010 were characterized by multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Detailed clinical information was obtained for all laboratory-confirmed cases of invasive NTHi disease in children during 2009-2013.\nRESULTS: In England and Wales, there were 7797 cases of invasive H. influenzae disease diagnosed during 2000-2013 and 1585 (20%) occurred in children aged 1 month to 10 years, where NTHi was responsible for 31-51 cases (incidence, 0.53-0.92/100,000) annually.

        "abstract": "Methylmercury (MeHg) exposure via fish in the diet remains a priority public health concern. Individual variation in response to a given MeHg exposure and the biotransformation of MeHg that follows complicate our understanding of this issue. MeHg elimination from the human body occurs slowly (elimination rate (kel) approximately 0.01\u2009day(-1) or approximately 70 days half-life [t1/2]) and is a major determinant of the Hg body burden resulting from fish consumption. The underlying mechanisms that control MeHg elimination from the human body remain poorly understood. We describe here improved methods to obtain a MeHg elimination rate via longitudinal Hg analysis in hair using laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. We measured MeHg elimination rates in eight individuals following the consumption of 3 fish meals in two 75-day trials separated by a 4-month washout period. In addition, since MeHg biotransformation to inorganic Hg (I-Hg) is associated with Hg excretion, we speciated Hg in feces samples to estimate individual MeHg de-methylation status. We observed a wide range of MeHg elimination rates between individuals and within individuals over time (kel\u2009=\u20090.0163-0.0054\u2009day(-1); estimated t1/2\u2009=\u200942.5-128.3 days). The ratio of MeHg and I-Hg in feces also varied widely among individuals. While the %I-Hg in feces was likely influenced by dental amalgams, findings with subjects who lacked amalgams suggest that faster MeHg elimination is associated with a higher %I-Hg in feces indicating more complete de-methylation. We anticipate these methods will contribute to future investigations of genetic and dietary factors that influence MeHg disposition in people.",

        "abstract": "KEY POINTS: Transcription is recruited by noradrenaline in the hippocampus. Epigenetic mechanisms are recruited by hippocampal noradrenergic receptor activation. Epigenetic regulation by noradrenaline offers a novel mechanism for long-term potentiation\nABSTRACT: Noradrenaline (NA) is a neuromodulator that can effect long-lasting changes in synaptic strength such as long-term potentiation (LTP), a putative cellular mechanism for memory formation in the mammalian brain. Persistent LTP requires alterations in gene expression that may involve epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation, histone acetylation and histone phosphorylation. It is known that \u03b2-adrenergic receptors and NA can boost LTP maintenance by regulating translation. However, it is unclear whether NA can additionally engage epigenetic mechanisms to regulate transcription and boost LTP endurance. To address this issue, we probed NA-treated mouse hippocampal slices with pharmacological inhibitors targeting epigenetic regulatory pathways and discovered that NA activates \u03b2-adrenergic receptors to boost LTP maintenance in area CA1 through DNA methylation and post-translational histone modifications. Specifically, NA paired with 100\u00a0Hz stimulation enhanced histone H3 acetylation and phosphorylation, both of which were required for NA-induced boosting of LTP maintenance. Together, our findings identify NA as a neuromodulatory transmitter capable of triggering epigenetic, transcriptional control of genes required for establishing persistent LTP in the mouse hippocampus. These modifications may contribute to the stabilization of memory.",

Recently, several lines of evidence suggest that the rs2853669 suppresses TERT promoter mutation-mediated TERT expression levels and cancer mortality as well as recurrence rates. However, no reports are available on the impact of rs2853669 on TERT expression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and its association with patient survival. Here, we found that HCC-related overall and recurrence-free survival rates were not associated with TERT promoter mutation individually, but rs2853669 and the TERT promoter mutation in combination were associated with poor survival rates. TERT mRNA expression and telomere fluorescence levels were greater in patients with HCC who had both the combination. The combination caused TERT promoter methylation through regulating the binding of DNA methyltransferase 1 and histone deacetylase 1 to the TERT promoter in HCC cell lines. The TERT expression level was significantly higher in HCC tumor with a methylated promoter than in that with an unmethylated promoter. In conclusion, we demonstrate a substantial role for the rs2853669 in HCC with TERT promoter mutation, which suggests that the combination of the rs2853669 and the mutation indicate poor prognoses in liver cancer.",

Pneumococcal isolates were collected from hospitalized children younger than 14 years. Their serotypes were determined using Quellung reactions with antisera; antibiotic resistance against 13 antimicrobials was tested using the E-test method or disc diffusion. The sequence types (STs) were analyzed with multilocus sequence typing.\nRESULTS: A total of 187 pneumococcal specimens were collected, including 21 invasive and 166 noninvasive isolates. The prevailing serotypes were 19F (31.6%), 19A (19.8%), 23F (11.2%), 6A (9.1%), 14 (9.1%) and 15B (5.9%). The coverage rates of PCV7, PCV10 and PCV13 were 56.2% (105/187), 56.7% (106/187) and 86.1% (161/187), respectively. The overall nonsusceptibility rate against penicillin was 8.0%; however, this rate would have been 91.5% if based on an oral breakpoint. All but one of the isolates were highly resistant to erythromycin. Multidrug resistance was exhibited by 177 (94.7%) isolates. The 5 predominant multilocus sequence typings for all pneumococci were ST271 (24.1%), ST320 (18.2%), ST81 (7.5%), ST876 (7%) and ST3397 (5.3%), which were primarily related to serotypes 19F, 19A, 23F, 14 and 15B, respectively. CC271 was the most frequent antibiotic-resistant complex clone.\nCONCLUSIONS: The coverage rates of PCVs were high, and the antibiotic resistance rates were of serious concern among hospitalized children. Universal immunization using PCVs would likely prevent episodes of S. pneumoniae diseases and the spread of antibiotic resistance in Beijing.",

The cost of a regular inversion is cubic and is prohibitively expensive for large matrices. Recent studies in cattle demonstrated that the inverse can be computed in almost linear time by recursion on any subset of \u223c10,000 individuals. The purpose of this study is to present a theory of why such a recursion works and its implication for other populations. Assume that, because of a small effective population size, the additive information in a genotyped population has a small dimensionality, even with a very large number of SNP markers. That dimensionality is visible as a limited number of effective SNP effects, independent chromosome segments, or the rank of the genomic relationship matrix. Decompose a population arbitrarily into core and noncore individuals, with the number of core individuals equal to that dimensionality. Then, breeding values of noncore individuals can be derived by recursions on breeding values of core individuals, with coefficients of the recursion computed from the genomic relationship matrix. A resulting algorithm for the inversion called \"algorithm for proven and young\" (APY) has a linear computing and memory cost for noncore animals. Noninfinitesimal genetic architecture can be accommodated through a trait-specific genomic relationship matrix, possibly derived from Bayesian regressions. For populations with small effective population size, the inverse of the genomic relationship matrix can be computed inexpensively for a very large number of genotyped individuals.",

The assay is compatible with DNA extracted from tissue and cell-free circulating DNA. The main features of E-ice-COLD-PCR are the simplicity of the setup and the optimization of the assay, the use of standard laboratory equipment and the very short time to results (~4 h including DNA extraction, enrichment and sequence-based identification of mutations). E-ice-COLD-PCR is therefore a highly promising technology for a number of basic research as well as clinical applications including detection of clinically relevant mutated subclones and monitoring of treatment response or disease recurrence.",

        "abstract": "By definition, pseudogenes are relics of former genes that no longer possess biological functions. Operationally, they are identified based on disruptions of open reading frames (ORFs) or presumed losses of promoter activities. Intriguingly, a recent human proteomic study reported peptides encoded by 107 pseudogenes. These peptides may play currently unrecognized physiological roles. Alternatively, they may have resulted from accidental translations of pseudogene transcripts and possess no function. Comparing between human and macaque orthologs, we show that the nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution rate ratio (\u03c9) is significantly smaller for translated pseudogenes than other pseudogenes. In particular, five of 34 translated pseudogenes amenable to evolutionary analysis have \u03c9 values significantly lower than 1, indicative of the action of purifying selection. This and other findings demonstrate that some but not all translated pseudogenes have selected functions at the protein level. Hence, neither ORF disruption nor presence of protein product disproves or proves gene functionality at the protein level.",

A meta-analysis was undertaken to estimate the effect of a susceptible genotype to periodontitis on the clinical outcomes of non-surgical periodontal therapy and the tooth survival.\nMATERIAL AND METHODS: A systematic search of MEDLINE-Pubmed, Cochrane Library and Scopus was performed. Additionally, a hand search was done in three journals. No specific language restriction was applied. Two reviewers screened independently titles and abstracts or full text copies. Quality assessment of all the included studies was held.\nRESULTS: Initial screening of electronic databases resulted in 283 articles. Ten studies met the inclusion criteria, nine of them examined the clinical outcome, while the other one investigated the tooth survival in susceptible individuals after non-surgical periodontal therapy. Eight of included studies were selected for the meta-analysis. IL-1 positive genotypes increase the risk of tooth loss, while no association found between the bleeding on probing (BOP), clinical attachment loss (CAL) and plaque index (PI) with the genotype status. Probing pocket depth (PPD) reduction in the first three months and in long-term results found to have a significant association with the genotype.\nCONCLUSIONS: There is no difference in the clinical measurements after non-surgical periodontal treatment, apart from PPD.

        "abstract": "A powerful way to detect selection in a population is by modeling local allele frequency changes in a particular region of the genome under scenarios of selection and neutrality and finding which model is most compatible with the data. A previous method based on a cross-population composite likelihood ratio (XP-CLR) uses an outgroup population to detect departures from neutrality that could be compatible with hard or soft sweeps, at linked sites near a beneficial allele. However, this method is most sensitive to recent selection and may miss selective events that happened a long time ago. To overcome this, we developed an extension of XP-CLR that jointly models the behavior of a selected allele in a three-population tree. Our method - called \"3-population composite likelihood ratio\" (3P-CLR) - outperforms XP-CLR when testing for selection that occurred before two populations split from each other and can distinguish between those events and events that occurred specifically in each of the populations after the split. We applied our new test to population genomic data from the 1000 Genomes Project, to search for selective sweeps that occurred before the split of Yoruba and Eurasians, but after their split from Neanderthals, and that could have led to the spread of modern-human-specific phenotypes. We also searched for sweep events that occurred in East Asians, Europeans, and the ancestors of both populations, after their split from Yoruba. In both cases, we are able to confirm a number of regions identified by previous methods and find several new candidates for selection in recent and ancient times. For some of these, we also find suggestive functional mutations that may have driven the selective events.",

We observed a pattern of sequencing interruption in the same position in all samples, suggesting the presence of a secondary structure hampering the DNA polymerase sliding during the sequencing process, which was confirmed after bioinformatics analysis. Considering the promoter region evaluated (nucleotide -440 to -1), only three variation sites were found, including one new variation site at position -104, and the concomitant deletions already described at positions -187 and -186.

Patients with INCL lack the lysosomal enzyme palmitoyl protein thioesterase-1 (PPT1, EC 3.1.2.22), resulting in intracellular accumulation of autofluorescent storage material and subsequent neuropathology. The Ppt1(-/-) mouse is deficient in PPT1 activity and represents a useful animal model of INCL that recapitulates most of the clinical and pathological aspects of the disease. Preclinical therapeutic experiments performed in the INCL mouse include CNS-directed gene therapy and recombinant enzyme replacement therapy; both seek to re-establish therapeutic levels of the deficient enzyme. We present a novel method for the histochemical localization of PPT1 activity in the Ppt1(-/-) mouse. By utilizing the substrate CUS-9235, tissues known to be positive for PPT1 activity turn varying intensities of blue. Presented here are histochemistry data showing the staining pattern in Ppt1(-/-), wild type, and Ppt1(-/-) mice treated with enzyme replacement therapy or AAV2/9-PPT1-mediated gene therapy.

We now report the characterization of 13 additional measures derived from the same endophenotype test paradigms in the COGS-1 families. Nine of the measures were found to discriminate between schizophrenia patients and controls, were significantly heritable (31 to 62%), and were sufficiently independent of previously assessed endophenotypes, demonstrating utility as additional endophenotypes. Genotyping via a custom array of 1536 SNPs from 94 candidate genes identified associations for CTNNA2, ERBB4, GRID1, GRID2, GRIK3, GRIK4, GRIN2B, NOS1AP, NRG1, and RELN across multiple endophenotypes. An experiment-wide p value of 0.003 suggested that the associations across all SNPs and endophenotypes collectively exceeded chance. Linkage analyses performed using a genome-wide SNP array further identified significant or suggestive linkage for six of the candidate endophenotypes, with several genes of interest located beneath the linkage peaks (e.g., CSMD1, DISC1, DLGAP2, GRIK2, GRIN3A, and SLC6A3). While the partial convergence of the association and linkage likely reflects differences in density of gene coverage provided by the distinct genotyping platforms, it is also likely an indication of the differential contribution of rare and common variants for some genes and methodological differences in detection ability. Still, many of the genes implicated by COGS through endophenotypes have been identified by independent studies of common, rare, and de novo variation in schizophrenia, all converging on a functional genetic network related to glutamatergic neurotransmission that warrants further investigation.",

Even without PGS, pregnancy rates for IVF surrogacy cases are generally satisfactory, especially when treatment utilizes embryos derived from young oocytes and transferred to a healthy surrogate. However, there could be a more general role for PGS in surrogacy, since background aneuploidy in embryos remains a major factor driving implantation failure and miscarriage for all infertility patients. At present, the proportion of IVF cases involving GS is limited, while the number of IVF patients requesting PGS appears to be increasing.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Molecular tumour profiling technologies have become increasingly important in the era of precision medicine, but their routine use is limited by their accessibility, cost, and tumour material availability. It is therefore crucial to assess their relative added value to optimize the sequence and combination of such technologies.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: Within the MOSCATO-01 trial, we investigated the added value of whole exome sequencing (WES) in patients that did not present any molecular abnormality on array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) and targeted gene panel sequencing (TGPS) using cancer specific panels. The pathogenicity potential and actionability of mutations detected on WES was assessed.\nRESULTS: Among 420 patients enrolled between December 2011 and December 2013, 283 (67%) patients were analysed for both TGPS and aCGH. The tumour sample of 25 (8.8%) of them presented a flat (or low-dynamic) aCGH profile and no pathogenic mutation on TGPS. We selected the first eligible 10 samples-corresponding to a heterogeneous cohort of different tumour types-to perform WES. This allowed identifying eight mutations of interest in two patients: FGFR3, PDGFRB, and CREBBP missense single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) in an urothelial carcinoma; FGFR2, FBXW7, TP53, and MLH1 missense SNVs as well as an ATM frameshift mutation in a squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue. The FGFR3 alteration had been previously described as an actionable activating mutation and might have resulted in treatment by an FGFR inhibitor. CREBBP and ATM alterations might also have suggested a therapeutic orientation towards epigenetic modifiers and ataxia-telangectasia and Rad3-related inhibitors, respectively.\nCONCLUSION: The therapeutic added value of performing WES on tumour samples that do not harbour any genetic abnormality on TGPS and aCGH might be limited and variable according to the histotype.

DNA preparations collected from a total of 81 recipient and donor pairs were used for PCR-based C4 subtyping and/or MICA sequence-based typing. Incidences of aGVHD were compared according to C4 and MICA matching. The six most common MICA alleles were MICA*008:01, *010:01, *002:01, *004, *009:01/049, and *012:01. Among the 59 unrelated pairs, HLA alleles were matched in 34 (57.6%). C4 subtypes were identical between the recipient and donor in 28 (82.4%) HLA-matched unrelated pairs, while MICA genotypes were matched in all HLA-matched unrelated pairs. In the 22 HLA-matched related pairs, all recipients showed identical C4 subtypes with their respective donors. In multivariate analysis, C4 mismatch was a significant risk factor associated with the development of aGVHD in unrelated HSCT (hazard ratio=3.24, P=0.006). PCR-based C4 subtyping is a simple method for assessing the genetic identity of the HLA region between a recipient and unrelated donor.

Hydrogels made from silk proteins have shown a potential in overcoming limitations of hydrogels prepared from conventional polymers. A great deal of effort has been made to control the properties and to integrate novel topographical and functional characteristics in the hydrogel composed from silk proteins. This review provides overview of the advances in silk protein-based hydrogels with a primary emphasis on hydrogels of fibroin. It describes the approaches used to fabricate fibroin hydrogels. Attempts to improve the existing properties or to incorporate new features in the hydrogels by making composites and by improving fibroin properties by genetic engineering approaches are also described. Applications of the fibroin hydrogels in the realms of tissue engineering and controlled release are reviewed and their future potentials are discussed.\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: This review describes the potentiality of silk fibroin hydrogel.

To better characterize brain responses underlying visual search deficits and test their specificity to schizophrenia we gathered behavioral and electrophysiological responses during visual search (i.e., Span of Apprehension [SOA] task) from 38 people with schizophrenia, 31 people with bipolar disorder, 58 biological relatives of people with schizophrenia, 37 biological relatives of people with bipolar disorder, and 65 non-psychiatric control participants. Through subtracting neural responses associated with purely sensory aspects of the stimuli we found that people with schizophrenia exhibited reduced early posterior task-related neural responses (i.e., Span Endogenous Negativity [SEN]) while other groups showed normative responses. People with schizophrenia exhibited longer reaction times than controls during visual search but nearly identical accuracy. Those individuals with schizophrenia who had larger SENs performed more efficiently (i.e., shorter reaction times) on the SOA task suggesting that modulation of early visual cortical responses facilitated their visual search. People with schizophrenia also exhibited a diminished P300 response compared to other groups. Unaffected first-degree relatives of people with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia showed an amplified N1 response over posterior brain regions in comparison to other groups.

In early-stage disease, a 5-year survival rate up to 75% can be achieved if stage-adjusted therapy is performed. There is wide geographic variability in the frequency of gallbladder carcinoma, which can only be explained by an interaction between genetic factors and their alteration. Gallstones and chronic cholecystitis are important risk factors in the formation of gallbladder malignancies. Factors such as chronic bacterial infection, primary sclerosing cholangitis, an anomalous junction of the pancreaticobiliary duct, and several types of gallbladder polyps are associated with a higher risk of gallbladder cancer. There is also an interesting correlation between risk factors and the histological type of cancer. However, despite theoretical risk factors, only a third of gallbladder carcinomas are recognized preoperatively. In most patients, the tumor is diagnosed by the pathologist after a routine cholecystectomy for a benign disease and is termed ''incidental or occult gallbladder carcinoma'' (IGBC). A cholecystectomy is performed frequently due to the minimal invasiveness of the laparoscopic technique. Therefore, the postoperative diagnosis of potentially curable early-stage disease is more frequent. A second radical re-resection to complete a radical cholecystectomy is required for several IGBCs. However, the literature and guidelines used in different countries differ regarding the radicality or T-stage criteria for performing a radical cholecystectomy. The NCCN guidelines and data from the German registry (GR), which records the largest number of incidental gallbladder carcinomas in Europe, indicate that carcinomas infiltrating the muscularis propria or beyond require radical surgery. According to GR data and current literature, a wedge resection with a combined dissection of the lymph nodes of the hepatoduodenal ligament is adequate for T1b and T2 carcinomas. The reason for a radical cholecystectomy after simple CE in a formally R0 situation is either occult invasion or hepatic spread with unknown lymphogenic dissemination. Unfortunately, there are diverse interpretations and practices regarding stage-adjusted therapy for gallbladder carcinoma. The current data suggest that more radical therapy is warranted.",

With so many inhibitors under development, further studies on predictive biomarkers are needed to measure the specificity of any therapeutic intervention. Herein, we review the common dysregulation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in GC and the various types of single or dual pathway inhibitors under development that might have a superior role in GC treatment.

Here we demonstrate that WGS performed prospectively for national epidemiologic surveillance of Listeria monocytogenes has the capacity to be superior to our current approaches using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), multilocus sequence typing (MLST), multilocus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis (MLVA), binary typing, and serotyping. Initially 423 L. monocytogenes isolates underwent WGS, and comparisons uncovered a diverse genetic population structure derived from three distinct lineages. MLST, binary typing, and serotyping results inferred in silico from the WGS data were highly concordant (>99%) with laboratory typing performed in parallel. However, WGS was able to identify distinct nested clusters within groups of isolates that were otherwise indistinguishable using our current typing methods. Routine WGS was then used for prospective epidemiologic surveillance on a further 97 L. monocytogenes isolates over a 12-month period, which provided a greater level of discrimination than that of conventional typing for inferring linkage to point source outbreaks. A risk-based alert system based on WGS similarity was used to inform epidemiologists required to act on the data. Our experience shows that WGS can be adopted for prospective L. monocytogenes surveillance and investigated for other pathogens relevant to public health.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: The poliovirus serotype identification and intratypic differentiation by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assay is suitable for serotype mixtures but not for intratypic mixtures of wild and vaccine poliovirus strains. This study was undertaken to develop wild poliovirus 1 and 3 (WPV1 and WPV3) specific rRT-PCR assays for use.\nMETHODS: Specific primers and probes for rRT-PCR were designed based on VP1 sequences of WPV1 and WPV3 isolated in India since 2000. The specificity of the rRT-PCR assays was evaluated using WPV1 and WPV3 of different genetic lineages, non-polio enteroviruses (NPEVs) and mixtures of wild/wild and wild/Sabin vaccine strains. The sensitivity of the assays was determined by testing serial 10-fold dilutions of wild poliovirus 1 and 3 stock suspensions of known titre.\nRESULTS: No cross-reactivity with Sabin strains, intertypic wild poliovirus isolates or 27 types of NPEVs across all the four Enterovirus species was found for both the wild poliovirus 1 and 3 rRT-PCR assays. All WPV1 and WPV3 strains isolated since 2000 were successfully amplified. The rRT-PCR assays detected 10 4.40 CCID 50 /ml of WPV1 and 10 4.00 CCID 50 /ml of WPV3, respectively either as single isolate or mixture with Sabin vaccine strains or intertypic wild poliovirus.\nINTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: rRT-PCR assays for WPV1 and WPV3 have been validated to detect all the genetic variations of the WPV1 and WPV3 isolated in India for the last decade. When used in combination with the current rRT-PCR assay testing was complete for confirmation of the presence of wild poliovirus in intratypic mixtures.",

        "title": "Adaptation to Parasites and Costs of Parasite Resistance in Mutator and Nonmutator Bacteria.",
        "abstract": "Parasitism creates selection for resistance mechanisms in host populations and is hypothesized to promote increased host evolvability. However, the influence of these traits on host evolution when parasites are no longer present is unclear. We used experimental evolution and whole-genome sequencing of Escherichia coli to determine the effects of past and present exposure to parasitic viruses (phages) on the spread of mutator alleles, resistance, and bacterial competitive fitness. We found that mutator alleles spread rapidly during adaptation to any of four different phage species, and this pattern was even more pronounced with multiple phages present simultaneously. However, hypermutability did not detectably accelerate adaptation in the absence of phages and recovery of fitness costs associated with resistance. Several lineages evolved phage resistance through elevated mucoidy, and during subsequent evolution in phage-free conditions they rapidly reverted to nonmucoid, phage-susceptible phenotypes. Genome sequencing revealed that this phenotypic reversion was achieved by additional genetic changes rather than by genotypic reversion of the initial resistance mutations. Insertion sequence (IS) elements played a key role in both the acquisition of resistance and adaptation in the absence of parasites; unlike single nucleotide polymorphisms, IS insertions were not more frequent in mutator lineages. Our results provide a genetic explanation for rapid reversion of mucoidy, a phenotype observed in other bacterial species including human pathogens. Moreover, this demonstrates that the types of genetic change underlying adaptation to fitness costs, and consequently the impact of evolvability mechanisms such as increased point-mutation rates, depend critically on the mechanism of resistance.",

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) might result in classical and alternative activation of rat neonatal microglia. Using Escherichia coli LPS-primed microglia as a positive control, this study revealed that treatment of rat microglia with Oscillatoria sp. LPS for 17\u2009h in\u00a0vitro resulted in both classical and alternative activation as well as concomitant pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory mediator release, in a concentration-dependent manner: (1) treatment with 0.1-10 000\u2009ng/ml Oscillatoria sp. LPS resulted in minimal lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) release, induced concentration-dependent and statistically significant O2 (-) generation, matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) release, generation of the cytokines tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), and the chemokines macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2/CXCL2), interferon \u03b3-induced protein 10\u2009kDa (IP-10/CXCL-10), (MIP-1\u03b1/CCL3), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1/CCL2), regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES/CCL5), and the alternative activation cytokine IL-10; (3) in contrast, treatment with 100 000\u2009ng/ml Oscillatoria sp. LPS appeared to damage the microglia cell membrane, because it resulted in minimal O2 (-) generation, statistically significant LDH release, and a decrease in the generation of all the cytokines and chemokines investigated, with the exception of IL-1\u03b1 and cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant 1 (CINC-1/CXCL1) generation, which was increased. Thus, our results provide experimental support for our working hypothesis, namely that Oscillatoria sp. LPS induces classical and alternative activation of rat brain microglia in\u00a0vitro in a concentration-dependent manner, namely 0.1-10 000\u2009ng/ml Oscillatoria sp. LPS, when microglia cells were shown to be viable. Furthermore, should cyanobacterium Oscillatoria sp. LPS gain entry into the CNS, our findings suggest that classical and alternative activation of rat brain microglia in\u00a0vivo, might lead to concomitant mediator release that could result in an interplay between neuroinflammation and neural repair in a concentration-dependent manner.",

This is partly due to lack of full length gene sequencing, especially for those alleles belonging to an allele ambiguity in which the first discovered allele has been assigned as the most frequent one. As members of the working group on Common and Well Documented (CWD) alleles and since we implemented full length group-specific sequencing as standard method routinely, we have investigated the presence of presumably rare alleles in our collection of HLA typing data. We identified 50 alleles, that were not previously encountered as Common or Well Documented. Sixteen of them should be added to the CWD catalogue, since we encountered them in 5 or more unrelated individuals. Another 11 could be added, based upon our results and the data present in the IMGT database and the rare allele section of the allele frequencies database. Furthermore, tight associations were observed between several different alleles even at the level of synonymous and non-coding sequences. In addition, in several cases the uncommon allele was found to be more frequent than its common counterpart.",

Malaria parasites (Plasmodium falciparum) provide an excellent organism to examine this prediction, because this protozoan shows a broad spectrum of population structures within a single species, with large, stable, outbred populations in Africa, small unstable inbred populations in South America and with intermediate population characteristics in South East Asia. We characterized 122 single-clone parasites, without prior laboratory culture, from malaria-infected patients in seven countries in Africa, South East Asia and South America using a high-density single-nucleotide polymorphism/CNV microarray. We scored 134 high-confidence CNVs across the parasite exome, including 33 deletions and 102 amplifications, which ranged in size from <500 bp to 59 kb, as well as 10,107 flanking, biallelic single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Overall, CNVs were rare, small, and skewed toward low frequency variants, consistent with the deleterious model. Relative to African and South East Asian populations, CNVs were significantly more common in South America, showed significantly less skew in allele frequencies, and were significantly larger. On this background of low frequency CNV, we also identified several high-frequency CNVs under putative positive selection using an FST outlier analysis. These included known adaptive CNVs containing rh2b and pfmdr1, and several other CNVs (e.g., DNA helicase and three conserved proteins) that require further investigation. Our data are consistent with a significant impact of genetic structure on CNV burden in an important human pathogen.",

In the present study, the effectiveness of this nematode control scheme was evaluated after 5 years by FECRT, larval development test (LDT), and a molecular test to assess the development of levamisole resistance in Haemonchus contortus. Animals were submitted to treatments with albendazole, levamisole, closantel, ivermectin, moxidectin, and monepantel. Eggs per gram of feces (EPG) counts and fecal cultures were performed, and anthelmintic efficacy was calculated by the RESO 4.0 program. The helminths of the flock (GIN Embrapa2014) were compared to susceptible (McMaster) and resistant (Embrapa2010) H. contortus isolates in the LDT to estimate the LC50 and LC90 of levamisole and in a molecular test to evaluate the 63-bp indel in the acr8 gene associated with levamisole resistance. In the FECRT, parasites were susceptible to monepantel (99.6 %) and closantel (98.3 %), but resistant to moxidectin (93.8 %), levamisole (70.4 %), ivermectin (48.1 %), and albendazole (0 %). In the coproculture on D14, and the control group presented 80 % H. contortus and 20 % Trichostrongylus sp., while in the monepantel group L1 were observed as well as Oesophagostomum sp. L3. LDT and resistance factors provided good separation between susceptible and resistant parasites. The genotypic frequencies of the 63-bp insertion in the acr8 gene in H. contortus were 11.9, 6.7, and 0 % in GIN Embrapa2014, Embrapa2010, and McMaster isolates, respectively. After 5 years of exclusive use, the nematodes developed resistance to levamisole, detected by FECRT and by increase in LC50 and LC90 for levamisole in the LDT. The 63-bp indel was not confirmed as a molecular marker of levamisole resistance in our isolates. The target selected treatment scheme was effective to control helminths in the sheep flock for 5 years, when levamisole's inefficacy was perceived because of no change in the clinical situation of treated animals. Through this scheme, it was possible to promote reversion towards susceptibility or increase of efficacy for other chemical classes. Thus, this is a valid recommendation to control worms and to delay the development of resistance, preserving other anthelmintic classes for future use.",

        "abstract": "Genetic variation is prevalent among individuals of the same species and yet the potential effects of genetic variation on developmental outcomes are frequently suppressed. Understanding the mechanisms that are responsible for this suppression is an important goal. Previously, we found that the microRNA miR-9a mitigates the impact of natural genetic variants that promote the development of scutellar bristles in adult Drosophila. Here we find that miR-9a does not affect the impact of genetic variants that inhibit the development of scutellar bristles. We show this using both directional and stabilizing selection in the laboratory. This specificity of action suggests that miR-9a does not interact with all functional classes of developmental genetic variants affecting sensory organ development. We also investigate the impact of miR-9a on a fitness trait, which is adult viability. At elevated physiological temperatures, miR-9a contributes to viability through masking genetic variants that hinder adult viability. We conclude that miR-9a activity in different developmental networks contributes to suppression of natural variants from perturbing development.",

A simulation model was generated to calculate the detection rate (DR) of the PV for SGA infants. A random variable was generated having the same number of cases, and the same means and standard deviation as those reported in the articles considered for the analysis.\nRESULTS: For the evaluation of the normal values of PV, 12 studies met the inclusion criteria. Four also produced an equation for PV estimation at 11 to 14\u2009weeks. The weighted mean PV [\u00b1standard error of mean (SEM)] of 7519 cases was 59.40\u2009\u00b1\u20091.533\u2009mL. For the estimation of PV performance in predicting SGA, five studies were included. The DR of the PV was 24.7% (19.3-30.1) at a 10% false-positive rate.\nCONCLUSION: The mean PV estimation of the studies analyzed was burdened by a high degree of heterogeneity. Instead, discordant results were reported for the possible prediction of SGA infants using PV. Surprisingly, just two articles reported the DR for SGA infants and also had proper statistical power. The discriminatory ability of using PV alone for predicting SGA appears to be modest, but could successfully be integrated into a multivariable screening method for SGA infants.",

Data were collected regarding pregnancy outcome, extracardiac anomalies (ECA), genetic and cardiac diagnoses, severity of valve regurgitation, gestational age at birth and birth weight. Fisher's exact test and odds ratios were used to compare outcomes between groups.\nRESULTS: A total of 501 pregnancies analyzed resulted in 445 live births, 22 IUFD, 16 terminations and 18 unknown outcomes. Amongst IUFD, 27% had a genetic diagnosis, 50% had an ECA and 27% had severe valve regurgitation. IUFD odds increased threefold with ECA and sevenfold with severe valve regurgitation.

This study investigated whether alterations of LTC structure were linked with impaired facial and/or verbal memory in young first-degree relatives of people with schizophrenia and, thus, may be indicators of vulnerability to the illness.\nMETHODS: Subjects included 27 non-psychotic, first-degree relatives of schizophrenia patients, and 48 healthy controls, between the ages of 13 and 28. Participants underwent high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 1.5Tesla. The LTC was parcellated into superior temporal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, inferior temporal gyrus, and temporal pole. Total cerebral and LTC volumes were measured using semi-automated morphometry. The Wechsler Memory Scale - Third Edition and the Children's Memory Scale - Third Edition assessed facial and verbal memory. General linear models tested for associations among LTC subregion volumes, familial risk and memory.\nRESULTS: Compared with controls, relatives had significantly smaller bilateral middle temporal gyri. Moreover, right middle temporal gyral volume showed a significant positive association with delayed facial memory in relatives.\nCONCLUSION: These results support the hypothesis that smaller middle temporal gyri are related to the genetic liability to schizophrenia and may be linked with reduced facial memory in persons at genetic risk for the illness. The findings add to the growing evidence that children at risk for schizophrenia on the basis of positive family history have cortical and subcortical structural brain abnormalities well before psychotic illness occurs.",

Incidence rates of MetS are significantly higher in patients with schizophrenia compared to the general population. Several factors contribute to this high comorbidity. This systematic review focuses on genetic factors and interrogates data from association studies of genes implicated in the development of MetS in patients with schizophrenia. We aimed to identify variants that potentially contribute to the high comorbidity between these disorders. PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus databases were accessed and a systematic review of published studies was conducted. Several genes showed strong evidence for an association with MetS in patients with schizophrenia, including the fat mass and obesity associated gene (FTO), leptin and leptin receptor genes (LEP, LEPR), methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene and the serotonin receptor 2C gene (HTR2C). Genetic association studies in complex disorders are convoluted by the multifactorial nature of these disorders, further complicating investigations of comorbidity. Recommendations for future studies include assessment of larger samples, inclusion of healthy controls, longitudinal rather than cross-sectional study designs, detailed capturing of data on confounding variables for both disorders and verification of significant findings in other populations. In future, big genomic datasets may allow for the calculation of polygenic risk scores in risk prediction of MetS in patients with schizophrenia.

CRISPR/Cas9 has recently emerged as a powerful and versatile genome editing tool for genome engineering in various species. We have used the CRISPR/Cas9 system to correct the ASXL1 homozygous nonsense mutation present in the CML cell line KBM5, which lacks ASXL1 protein expression. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated ASXL1 homozygous correction resulted in protein re-expression with restored normal function, including down-regulation of Polycomb repressive complex 2 target genes. Significantly reduced cell growth and increased myeloid differentiation were observed in ASXL1 mutation-corrected cells, providing new insights into the role of ASXL1 in human myeloid cell differentiation. Mice xenografted with mutation-corrected KBM5 cells showed significantly longer survival than uncorrected xenografts. These results show that the sole correction of a driver mutation in leukemia cells increases survival in vivo in mice.

        "abstract": "Mosquitoes are vectors of devastating pathogens and parasites, causing millions of deaths every year. Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral infection found in tropical and subtropical regions around the world. Recently, dengue transmission has strongly increased in urban and semiurban areas, becoming a major international public health concern. Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae) is a primary vector of dengue. Shedding light on genetic deviation in A. aegypti populations is of crucial importance to fully understand their molecular ecology and evolution. In this research, haplotype and genetic analyses were conducted using individuals of A. aegypti from 31 localities in the north, southeast, northeast and central regions of Tamil Nadu (South India). The mitochondrial DNA region of cytochrome c oxidase 1 (CO1) gene was used as marker for the analyses. Thirty-one haplotypes sequences were submitted to GenBank and authenticated. The complete haplotype set included 64 haplotypes from various geographical regions clustered into three groups (lineages) separated by three fixed mutational steps, suggesting that the South Indian Ae. aegypti populations were pooled and are linked with West Africa, Columbian and Southeast Asian lineages. The genetic and haplotype diversity was low, indicating reduced gene flow among close populations of the vector, due to geographical barriers such as water bodies. Lastly, the negative values for neutrality tests indicated a bottle-neck effect and supported for low frequency of polymorphism among the haplotypes. Overall, our results add basic knowledge to molecular ecology of the dengue vector A. aegypti, providing the first evidence for multiple introductions of Ae. aegypti populations from Columbia and West Africa in South India.",

        "title": "The Role of Recombination in Evolutionary Rescue.",
        "abstract": "How likely is it that a population escapes extinction through adaptive evolution? The answer to this question is of great relevance in conservation biology, where we aim at species' rescue and the maintenance of biodiversity, and in agriculture and medicine, where we seek to hamper the emergence of pesticide or drug resistance. By reshuffling the genome, recombination has two antagonistic effects on the probability of evolutionary rescue: it generates and it breaks up favorable gene combinations. Which of the two effects prevails depends on the fitness effects of mutations and on the impact of stochasticity on the allele frequencies. In this article, we analyze a mathematical model for rescue after a sudden environmental change when adaptation is contingent on mutations at two loci. The analysis reveals a complex nonlinear dependence of population survival on recombination. We moreover find that, counterintuitively, a fast eradication of the wild type can promote rescue in the presence of recombination. The model also shows that two-step rescue is not unlikely to happen and can even be more likely than single-step rescue (where adaptation relies on a single mutation), depending on the circumstances.",

        "abstract": "MOTIVATION: Phosphoproteomics measurements are widely applied in cellular biology to detect changes in signalling dynamics. However, due to the inherent complexity of phosphorylation patterns and the lack of knowledge on how phosphorylations are related to functions, it is often not possible to directly deduce protein activities from those measurements. Here, we present a heuristic machine learning algorithm that infers the activities of kinases from Phosphoproteomics data using kinase-target information from the PhosphoSitePlus database. By comparing the estimated kinase activity profiles to the measured phosphosite profiles, it is furthermore possible to derive the kinases that are most likely to phosphorylate the respective phosphosite.\nRESULTS: We apply our approach to published datasets of the human cell cycle generated from HeLaS3 cells, and insulin signalling dynamics in mouse hepatocytes. In the first case, we estimate the activities of 118 at six cell cycle stages and derive 94 new kinase-phosphosite links that can be validated through either database or motif information. In the second case, the activities of 143 kinases at eight time points are estimated and 49 new kinase-target links are derived.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The algorithm is implemented in Matlab and be downloaded from github. It makes use of the Optimization and Statistics toolboxes. https://github.com/marcel-mischnik/IKAP.git.\nCONTACT: marcel.mischnik@gmail.com\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Many patients with type 2 diabetes fail to achieve good glycaemic control. Poor control is associated with complications including coronary heart disease (CHD). Effective self-management and engagement in health behaviours can reduce risks of complications. However, patients often struggle to adopt and maintain these behaviours. Self-management interventions have been found to be effective in improving glycaemic control. Recent developments in the field of genetics mean that patients can be given personalised information about genetic- and lifestyle-associated risk of developing CHD. Such information may increase patients' motivation to engage in self-management. The Coronary Risk in Diabetes (CoRDia) trial will compare the effectiveness of a self-management intervention, with and without provision of personalised genetic- and lifestyle-associated risk information, with usual care, on clinical and behavioural outcomes, the cognitive predictors of behaviour, and psychological wellbeing.\nMETHODS/DESIGN: Participants will be adults aged 25-74 years registered with general practices in the East of England, diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, with no history of heart disease, and with a glycated haemoglobin level of \u22656.45% (47 mmol/mol). Consenting participants will be randomised to one of three arms: usual care control, group self-management only, group self-management plus personalised genetic- and lifestyle-associated risk information. The self-management groups will receive four weekly 2-hour group sessions, focusing on knowledge and information sharing, problem solving, goal setting and action planning to promote medication adherence, healthy eating, and physical activity. Primary outcomes are glycaemic control and CHD risk. Clinical data will be collected from GP records, including HbA1c, weight, body mass index, blood pressure, and HDL and total cholesterol. Self-reported health behaviours, including medication adherence, healthy eating and physical activity, and cognitive outcomes will be assessed by questionnaire. Measures will be taken at baseline, 3 months (questionnaire only), 6 months and 12 months post-baseline.\nDISCUSSION: This study will determine whether the addition of personalised genetic- and lifestyle-associated CHD risk information to a group self-management intervention improves diabetes control and CHD risk compared with group self-management and usual care. Effectiveness of the combined intervention on health behaviours cognitions theorised to predict them, and psychological outcomes will also be investigated.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: This study has been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov; registration identifier NCT01891786 , registered 28 June 2013.",

        "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric disorder associated with impaired fronto-striatal functioning. Similar deficits are observed in unaffected siblings of patients, indicating that these deficits are linked to a familial risk for the disorder. Fronto-striatal deficits may arise during adolescence and precede clinical manifestation of the disorder. However, the development of the fronto-striatal network in adolescents at increased familial risk for schizophrenia is still poorly understood. In this cross-sectional study, we investigate the impact of familial risk on fronto-striatal functioning across age related to reward anticipation and receipt in 25 adolescent offspring of schizophrenia patients (SZ offspring) and 36 age-matched healthy controls (range 10-19years). Subjects performed a reward task while being scanned with functional MRI. Overall response times and the amount of money won did not differ between the groups. Striatal activation during reward anticipation decreased across age in the SZ offspring, while it did not in the healthy controls. Activation in the orbitofrontal cortex during reward receipt did not differ between the groups. These results, taken together with data from adult schizophrenia patients and their siblings, indicate that the diminishing striatal activation across adolescence may signify a familial vulnerability for schizophrenia.",

Porcine uterine development, initiated before birth, is completed postnatally. However, age- and lactocrine-sensitive elements of the neonatal porcine uterine developmental program are undefined. Here, effects of age and nursing on the uterine transcriptome for 48 h from birth (Postnatal Day [PND] = 0) were identified using RNA sequencing (RNAseq). Uterine tissues were obtained from neonatal gilts (n = 4 per group) within 1 h of birth and before feeding (PND 0), or 48 h after nursing ad libitum (PND 2N) or feeding a commercial milk replacer (PND 2R). RNAseq analysis revealed differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with both age (PND 2N vs. PND 0; 3283 DEGs) and nursing on PND 2 (PND 2N vs PND 2R; 896 DEGs). Expression of selected uterine genes was validated using quantitative real-time PCR. Bioinformatic analyses revealed multiple biological processes enriched in response to both age and nursing, including cell adhesion, morphogenesis, and cell-cell signaling. Age-sensitive pathways also included estrogen receptor-alpha and hedgehog signaling cascades. Lactocrine-sensitive processes in nursed gilts included those involved in response to wounding, the plasminogen activator network and coagulation. Overall, RNAseq analysis revealed comprehensive age- and nursing-related transcriptomic differences in the neonatal porcine uterus and identified novel pathways and biological processes regulating uterine development.",

        "abstract": "Accurate detection of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) constitutes a major laboratory diagnostic challenge. We evaluated an electrochemical technique (the BYG Carba test) which allows detection of CPE in less than 35 min. The BYG Carba test was first validated in triplicate against 57 collection isolates with previously characterized \u03b2-lactam resistance mechanisms (OXA-48, n = 12; KPC, n = 8; NDM, n = 8; VIM, n = 8; IMP, n = 3; GIM, n = 1; GES-6, n = 1; no carbapenemase, n = 16) and against a panel of 10 isolates obtained from the United Kingdom National External Quality Assessment Service (NEQAS). The test was then evaluated prospectively against 324 isolates referred to the national reference center for suspicion of CPE. The BYG Carba test results were compared with those obtained with the Carba NP test using multiplex PCR sequencing as the gold standard. Of the 57 collection and the 10 NEQAS isolates, all but one GES-6-producing isolate were correctly identified by the Carba BYG test. Among the 324 consecutive Enterobacteriaceae isolates tested prospectively, 146 were confirmed as noncarbapenemase producers by PCR while 178 harbored a carbapenemase gene (OXA-48, n = 117; KPC, n = 25; NDM, n = 23; and VIM, n = 13). Prospectively, in comparison with PCR results, the BYG Carba test displayed 95% sensitivity and 100% specificity versus 89% and 100%, respectively, for the Carba NP test. The BYG Carba test is a novel, rapid, and efficient assay based on an electro-active polymer biosensing technology discriminating between CPE and non-CPE. The precise electrochemical signal (electrochemical impedance variations) allows the establishment of real-time objective measurement and interpretation criteria which should facilitate the accreditation process of this technology.",

Here, we assessed the consistency between PCR from a diagnostic laboratory, quantitative PCR (qPCR) from a research laboratory, 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and metagenomic shotgun sequencing (MSS) for Clostridium difficile identification in diarrhea stool samples. Twenty-two C. difficile-positive diarrhea samples identified by PCR and qPCR and five C. difficile-negative diarrhea controls were studied. C. difficile was detected in 90.9% of C. difficile-positive samples using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and C. difficile was detected in 86.3% of C. difficile-positive samples using MSS. CFU inferred from qPCR analysis were positively correlated with the relative abundance of C. difficile from 16S rRNA gene sequencing (r(2) = -0.60) and MSS (r(2) = -0.55). C. difficile was codetected with Clostridium perfringens, norovirus, sapovirus, parechovirus, and anellovirus in 3.7% to 27.3% of the samples. A high load of Candida spp. was found in a symptomatic control sample in which no causative agents for diarrhea were identified in routine clinical testing. Beta-lactamase and tetracycline resistance genes were the most prevalent (25.9%) antibiotic resistance genes in these samples. In summary, the proof-of-concept study demonstrated that next-generation sequencing (NGS) in pathogen detection is moderately correlated with laboratory testing and is advantageous in detecting pathogens without a priori knowledge.",

        "abstract": "Predicting the accuracy of estimated genomic values using genome-wide marker information is an important step in designing training populations. Currently, different deterministic equations are available to predict accuracy within populations, but not for multipopulation scenarios where data from multiple breeds, lines or environments are combined. Therefore, our objective was to develop and validate a deterministic equation to predict the accuracy of genomic values when different populations are combined in one training population. The input parameters of the derived prediction equation are the number of individuals and the heritability from each of the populations in the training population; the genetic correlations between the populations, i.e., the correlation between allele substitution effects of quantitative trait loci; the effective number of chromosome segments across predicted and training populations; and the proportion of the genetic variance in the predicted population captured by the markers in each of the training populations. Validation was performed based on real genotype information of 1033 Holstein-Friesian cows that were divided into three different populations by combining half-sib families in the same population. Phenotypes were simulated for multiple scenarios, differing in heritability within populations and in genetic correlations between the populations. Results showed that the derived equation can accurately predict the accuracy of estimating genomic values for different scenarios of multipopulation genomic prediction. Therefore, the derived equation can be used to investigate the potential accuracy of different multipopulation genomic prediction scenarios and to decide on the most optimal design of training populations.",

We selected \u03b2-carbonic anhydrase (\u03b2-CA) gene as a target, because it is present in many parasites genomes but absent in vertebrates. We developed a novel \u03b2-CA gene-based method for detection of Trichinella larvae in biological samples. We first identified a \u03b2-CA protein sequence from Trichinella spiralis by bioinformatic tools using \u03b2-CAs from Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster. Thereafter, 16 sets of designed primers were tested to detect \u03b2-CA genomic sequences from three species of Trichinella, including T. spiralis, Trichinella pseudospiralis and Trichinella nativa. Among all 16 sets of designed primers, the primer set No. 2 efficiently amplified \u03b2-CA genomic sequences from T. spiralis, T. pseudospiralis and T. nativa without any false-positive amplicons from other parasite samples including Toxoplasma gondii, Toxocara cati and Parascaris equorum.

We investigated the predictive value of age of psychosis onset for severity, functioning and demographic variation by: 1) comparing groups based on traditional cut-offs for age of psychosis onset, and 2) using receiver operating characteristic (ROC)-curve calculations, without a priori age of onset cut-offs.\nMETHOD: Participants were 88 (45 female, 43 male) children and adolescents with a recent onset of psychosis (age range=6.7-17.5years; M=13.74, SD=2.37).\nRESULTS: The VEOP group had significantly shorter duration of untreated illness and untreated psychosis, and lower functioning than the EOP group. The VEOP and EOP groups did not differ significantly on gender proportion, urbanicity, psychotic diagnosis, family history of psychotic disorder, psychotic, depressive and anxiety symptoms or IQ. When applying ROC-curves to the lowest three quartiles of positive psychotic symptoms scores, the optimal age-cut-off was 14.0years (sensitivity=0.62; specificity=0.75). For the highest quartile of functioning scores, the optimal differentiating cut-off for age of psychosis onset was 14.7years (sensitivity=0.71; specificity=0.70).\nCONCLUSIONS: Larger samples of patients, assessed at presentation and followed-up, are necessary to clearly examine clinical presentation and outcome as a function of social and neural development to better understand if the differentiation between VEOP and EOP is justified. This will aid the development of predictive diagnostic tools, more accurate prognosis prediction, and age-tailored therapeutic interventions.",

The virologic failure rate was 3% (13/436) across the two studies. Analyses were conducted to evaluate the impact of baseline resistance-associated variants (RAVs) on treatment outcome and the emergence and persistence of RAVs in patients experiencing virologic failure. Baseline paritaprevir resistance-conferring variants in NS3 were infrequent, while Y93H in NS5A was the most prevalent ombitasvir resistance-conferring variant at baseline. A comparison of baseline prevalence of polymorphisms in Japanese and western patients showed that Q80L and S122G in NS3 and L28M, R30Q, and Y93H in NS5A were significantly more prevalent in Japanese patients. In the GIFT-I study, the prevalence of Y93H in NS5A varied between 13% and 21% depending on the deep-sequencing detection threshold. Among patients with Y93H comprising <1%, 1 to 40%, or >40% of their preexisting viral population, the 24-week SVR (SVR24) rates were >99% (276/277), 93% (38/41), and 76% (25/33), respectively, indicating that the prevalence of Y93H within a patient's viral population is a good predictor of treatment response. The predominant RAVs at the time of virologic failure were D168A/V in NS3 and Y93H alone or in combination with other variants in NS5A. While levels of NS3 RAVs declined over time, NS5A RAVs persisted through posttreatment week 48. Results from these analyses are informative in understanding the resistance profile of an ombitasvir- plus paritaprevir/ritonavir-based regimen in Japanese GT1b-infected patients.",

In this study, phenotypic characterization of 433 clinical S. Enteritidis strains obtained from a nationwide collection of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention during the period from 2005 to 2010 depicted a trend of increasing resistance to ceftriaxone from 2008 onwards. Seventeen (4%) of the strains were found to be resistant to ceftriaxone, 7% were found to be resistant to ciprofloxacin, and 0.7% were found to be resistant to both ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone. Most of the ceftriaxone-resistant S. Enteritidis strains (15/17) were genetically unrelated and originated from Henan Province. The complete sequence of an IncI1 plasmid, pSE115, which belonged to a novel sequence type, was obtained. This 87,255-bp IncI1 plasmid was found to harbor a blaCTX-M-14 gene in a novel multidrug resistance region (MRR) within the tra locus. Although the majority of strains were also found to contain conjugative IncI1 plasmids with a size similar to that of pSE115 (\u223c90 kb) and harbor a variety of blaCTX-M group 1 and group 9 elements, the novel MRR site at the tra locus in pSE115 was not detectable in the other IncI1 plasmids. The findings from this study show that cephalosporin resistance in S.

According to the CLSI guidelines for ECV setting, ECVs encompassing \u226597.5% of pooled statistically modeled MIC distributions were as follows: for amphotericin B, 4 \u03bcg/ml (F. verticillioides) and 8 \u03bcg/ml (F. oxysporum SC and F. solani SC); for posaconazole, 2 \u03bcg/ml (F. verticillioides), 8 \u03bcg/ml (F. oxysporum SC), and 32 \u03bcg/ml (F. solani SC); for voriconazole, 4 \u03bcg/ml (F. verticillioides), 16 \u03bcg/ml (F. oxysporum SC), and 32 \u03bcg/ml (F. solani SC); and for itraconazole, 32 \u03bcg/ml (F. oxysporum SC and F. solani SC). Insufficient data precluded ECV definition for the other species. Although these ECVs could aid in detecting non-wild-type isolates with reduced susceptibility to the agents evaluated, the relationship between molecular mechanisms of resistance (gene mutations) and MICs still needs to be investigated for Fusarium spp.",

        "title": "Family tree and ancestry inference: is there a need for a 'generational' consent?",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Genealogical research and ancestry testing are popular recreational activities but little is known about the impact of the use of these services on clients' biological and social families. Ancestry databases are being enriched with self-reported data and data from deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) analyses, but also are being linked to other direct-to-consumer genetic testing and research databases. As both family history data and DNA can provide information on more than just the individual, we asked whether companies, as a part of the consent process, were informing clients, and through them clients' relatives, of the potential implications of the use and linkage of their personal data.\nMETHODS: We used content analysis to analyse publically-available consent and informational materials provided to potential clients of ancestry and direct-to-consumer genetic testing companies to determine what consent is required, what risks associated with participation were highlighted, and whether the consent or notification of third parties was suggested or required.\nRESULTS: We identified four categories of companies providing: 1) services based only on self-reported data, such as personal or family history; 2) services based only on DNA provided by the client; 3) services using both; and 4) services using both that also have a research component. The amount of information provided on the potential issues varied significantly across the categories of companies. 'Traditional' ancestry companies showed the greatest awareness of the implications for family members, while companies only asking for DNA focused solely on the client. While in some cases companies included text recommending clients inform their relatives, showing they recognised the issues, often it was located within lengthy terms and conditions or privacy statements that may not be read by potential clients.\nCONCLUSIONS: We recommend that companies should make it clearer that clients should inform third parties about their plans to participate, that third parties' data will be provided to companies, and that that data will be linked to other databases, thus raising privacy and issues on use of data. We also suggest investigating whether a 'generational consent' should be created that would include more than just the individual in decisions about participating in genetic investigations.",

To do this, we discuss relevant findings from the ROOTS study, and review its strengths and limitations.\nMETHODS: We examined all publications from the ROOTS study up to July 2015, selected those examining adolescent mental health, and classified them as investigating (a) childhood risk factors for adolescent depression, (b) genetic and cognitive vulnerability to depression in adolescence, (c) genetic markers, childhood adversities, and neuroendophenotypes, (d) morning cortisol and depression, (e) physical activity and depression symptoms, and (f) the underlying structure of mental health in adolescence. We reviewed the strengths and limitations of the ROOTS study, and how they feed into recommendations for future longitudinal research.\nRESULTS: There was evidence supporting a putative hormonal biomarker for the emergence of depression in boys. Environmental pathways from child adversity to adolescent depression were confirmed in girls, partly accounted for by negative life events in early adolescence. The preceding role of automatic cognitive biases assessed using behavioural tasks was substantiated, with evidence for genetic susceptibility. Novel latent statistical models of child adversity, depression, anxiety, and psychotic experiences were produced, with concurrent and prospective validity. Our experiences conducting the ROOTS study resulted in a set of strengths, limitations, and recommendations for future longitudinal studies.\nCONCLUSIONS: The ROOTS study has advanced knowledge on the aetiology of adolescent depression by investigating environmental, genetic, hormonal, and neural risk factors. Findings provide a foundation for future research integrating cognitive neuroscience with epidemiology.",

Microbial colonization of the gut shortly after birth is vital for the proper development of immune, neural and metabolic systems, while sustaining a balanced, diverse gut flora populated with beneficial bacteria is necessary for maintaining optimal function of these systems. Although symbiotic host-microbial interactions are important throughout the lifespan, these interactions can have greater and longer lasting impacts during certain critical developmental periods. A better understanding of these sensitive periods is necessary to improve the impact and effectiveness of health-promoting interventions that target the microbial ecosystem.

In this review the authors summarize the CRC-specific nucleic acid biomarkers measured in peripheral blood and their potential as screening markers. Detection of DNA mutation has inadequate sensitivity; however, methylated DNA can be established with higher sensitivity from CRC plasma samples. The ribonucleic acid based miRNA studies represented higher sensitivity for CRC as compared with mRNA studies. Recently, isolation of cfDNA has become automated, highly reproducible and a high throughput method.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the extent to which prospectively identified responders to cognitive therapy (CT) for recurrent major depressive disorder (MDD) hypothesized to be lower risk show significantly less relapse or recurrence than treated higher risk counterparts across 32 months.\nMETHOD: Outpatients (N = 523), aged 18-70, with recurrent MDD received 12-14 weeks of CT. The last 7 consecutive scores from the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD-17) were used to stratify or define responders (n = 290) into lower (7 HRSD-17 scores of less than or equal to 6; n = 49; 17%) and higher risk (n = 241; 83%). The lower risk patients entered the 32-month follow-up. Higher risk patients were randomized to 8 months of continuation-phase CT or clinical management plus double-blind fluoxetine or pill placebo, with a 24-month follow-up.\nRESULTS: Lower risk patients were significantly less likely to relapse over the first 8 months compared to higher risk patients (Kaplan-Meier [KM] estimates; i.e., 4.9% = lower risk; 22.1% = higher risk; log-rank \u03c72 = 6.83, p = .009). This increased risk was attenuated, but not completely neutralized, by active continuation-phase therapy. Over the subsequent 24 months, the lower and higher risk groups did not differ in relapse or recurrence risk.\nCONCLUSIONS: Rapid and sustained acute-phase CT remission identifies responders who do not require continuation-phase treatment to prevent relapse (i.e., return of an index episode). To prevent recurrence (i.e., new episodes), however, strategic allocation and more frequent \"dosing\" of CT and/or targeted maintenance-phase treatments may be required. Longitudinal follow-up is recommended.",

Thus, in the genetic context, validated measures of adjustment are required. Given that self-concept is a good indicator of adjustment to the disease or to the risk for it, and a relevant variable in oncology, the goal of the study is to culturally adapt and validate the BRCA Self-Concept Scale.\nMATERIAL AND METHOD: One hundred and sixty-five BRCA carriers' women answered to the questionnaire, previously adapted through a process of forward/back-translation, and to the Cancer Worry Scale (CWS) as a measure of convergent validity. Theoretical structure of BRCA Self-Concept Scale was assessed by expert judges, and submitted to a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Cronbach's \u03b1 was calculated for each subscale (Stigma, Vulnerability and Control), and correlations with CWS were performed.\nRESULTS: Expert judges' structure and CFA do not support the original structure of the questionnaire. The respecificity model (with items 10 and 13 loading on Vulnerability factor) show a better fit: comparative fit index 0.973; Tucker-Lewis index 0.968; root mean square error of approximation 0.067. The Cronbach's \u03b1 is 0.83 for Stigma, 0.84 for Vulnerability, and 0.61 for Control. Evidence of convergent validity with CWS has been obtained (Spearman's rho 0.631 for Stigma, 0.683 for Vulnerability, and -0.363 for Control; P<.001).\nCONCLUSIONS: Results support the validity of the modified Spanish BRCA Self-Concept Scale, which is a potentially useful measure for the study of psychological adjustment to high risk for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer.",

Antimicrobial therapy, only recommended in critical cases, is challenged by resistance mechanisms that should be unambiguously detected for achievement of effective treatments. Quinolone (ciprofloxacin) resistance of Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli, the 2 main Campylobacter detected in humans, is conferred by the mutation gyrA C-257-T, which can be genotyped by several methods that require a previous identification of the pathogen species to circumvent the sequence polymorphism of the gene. A multiplex PCR, based on degenerated oligonucleotides, has been designed for unambiguous identification of the quinolone resistance determinant in Campylobacter spp. isolates. The method was verified with 249 Campylobacter strains isolated from humans (141 isolates) and from the 3 most important animal sources for this zoonosis: poultry (34 isolates), swine (38 isolates), and cattle (36 isolates). High resistance to ciprofloxacin, MIC above 4\u03bcg/mL, linked to the mutated genotype predicted by MAMA-DEG PCR (mismatch amplification mutation assay PCR with degenerated primers) was found frequently among isolates from the different hosts.",

We searched for global bronchiolitis (International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision, Clinical Modification codes 466.1, 466.11 and 466.19) and RSV bronchiolitis (code 466.11 and code 466.19 with positive RSV test) in the first appearance either in primary care or in hospitalization databases. A preterm subcohort (International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision, Clinical Modification codes 765) was also analyzed.\nRESULTS: The cohort consisted of 198,223 children of whom 41,479 were diagnosed of bronchiolitis (incidence rate 16.4/100 children <2 years per year). Of those, 5390 were hospitalized with the majority of hospitalizations occurring at <6 months of age (incidence rate of 5.2/100 children <6 months per year) and 3106 of the hospitalizations were RSV positive (incidence rate 3.2/100 children <6 months per year). RSV hospitalizations were 26% longer than non-RSV. In preterm infants, hospitalization incidence was more than double, and the mean length of hospitalization was 29% longer.\nCONCLUSIONS: Most (87%) bronchiolitis cases are managed in primary care offices.

The ultrahigh dimensionality of big data brings unprecedented challenges to statistical modeling such as noise accumulation, the curse of dimensionality, computational burden, spurious correlations, and a processing and storing bottleneck. The traditional statistical approaches lose their power due to [Formula: see text] (n is the number of observations and p is the number of SNPs) and the complex correlation structure among SNPs. In this article, we propose an integrated distance correlation ridge regression (DCRR) approach to accommodate the ultrahigh dimensionality, joint polygenic effects of multiple loci, and the complex LD structures. Initially, a distance correlation (DC) screening approach is used to extensively remove noise, after which LD structure is addressed using a ridge penalized multiple logistic regression (LRR) model. The false discovery rate, true positive discovery rate, and computational cost were simultaneously assessed through a large number of simulations. A binary trait of Arabidopsis thaliana, the hypersensitive response to the bacterial elicitor AvrRpm1, was analyzed in 84 inbred lines (28 susceptibilities and 56 resistances) with 216,130 SNPs.

To determine phenotype distributions, this study developed and applied type-specific quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays to samples from the North and South Pacific. Abundances of both Crocosphaera types declined sharply with depth between 45 and 75 m in both sites. In surface water small cells were 10-100 times more abundant than large cells in the N.

In the present study, we determined the mutational status of KRAS in plasma cfDNA using multiplex picoliter-droplet digital PCR in 259 patients with PDAC. We constructed a novel modified SureSelect-KAPA-Illumina platform and an original panel of 60 genes. We then performed targeted deep sequencing of cfDNA and matched germline DNA samples in 48 patients who had \u22651% mutant allele frequencies of KRAS in plasma cfDNA. Importantly, potentially targetable somatic mutations were identified in 14 of 48 patients (29.2%) examined by targeted deep sequencing of cfDNA. We also analyzed somatic copy number alterations based on the targeted sequencing data using our in-house algorithm, and potentially targetable amplifications were detected. Assessment of mutations and copy number alterations in plasma cfDNA may provide a prognostic and diagnostic tool to assist decisions regarding optimal therapeutic strategies for PDAC patients.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To compare SMAD3 gene expression between human osteoarthritic and healthy cartilage and to examine whether expression is regulated by the promoter DNA methylation of the gene.\nMETHODS: Human cartilage samples were collected from patients undergoing total hip/knee joint replacement surgery due to primary osteoarthritis (OA), and from patients with hip fractures as controls. DNA/RNA was extracted from the cartilage tissues. Real-time quantitative PCR was performed to measure gene expression, and Sequenom EpiTyper was used to assay DNA methylation. Mann-Whitney test was used to compare the methylation and expression levels between OA cases and controls. Spearman rank correlation coefficient was calculated to examine the association between the methylation and gene expression.\nRESULTS: A total of 58 patients with OA (36 women, 22 men; mean age 64 \u00b1 9 yrs) and 55 controls (43 women, 12 men; mean age 79 \u00b1 10 yrs) were studied. SMAD3 expression was on average 83% higher in OA cartilage than in controls (p = 0.0005). No difference was observed for DNA methylation levels in the SMAD3 promoter region between OA cases and controls. No correlation was found between SMAD3 expression and promoter DNA methylation.\nCONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that SMAD3 is significantly overexpressed in OA. This overexpression cannot be explained by DNA methylation in the promoter region. The results suggest that the transforming growth factor-\u03b2/SMAD3 pathway may be overactivated in OA cartilage and has potential in developing targeted therapies for OA.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: The London Child Health and Development Study (CHADS) is a prospective, longitudinal investigation of children, sampled from the general community aged 9-11 years and assessed biennially, who present premorbid risk markers for schizophrenia. The study aims to characterise developmental trajectories of psychological, cognitive, and biological functioning in at-risk children and identify potential targets for early preventative intervention. This review summarises CHADS findings, discusses these in the context of recent theory regarding aetiology and prevention of schizophrenia, and highlights challenges to be addressed with future research.\nMETHODS: We review (1) epidemiological information on the prevalence and correlates of developmental antecedents of schizophrenia in the general child population, (2) evidence of psychosocial, cognitive, and biological dysfunctions in at-risk children presenting multiple antecedents of schizophrenia and at-risk children with a family history of schizophrenia, and (3) related findings from an associated sample of help-seeking children receiving intervention.\nRESULTS: Community-based screening of 9-11-year olds identified ~9 % with a triad of antecedents of schizophrenia [including psychotic-like experiences (PLEs)] who are putatively at-risk of psychosis; these children reported greater exposure and responsivity to stressors, impairments in general intelligence and specific cognitive functions, brain structure and function abnormalities, and neuromotor dysfunction. Preliminary evidence suggests distressing PLEs are a viable target for cognitive-behavioural intervention in at-risk children.\nCONCLUSIONS: Intervention in early, premorbid phases of illness might alleviate current difficulties and avert future schizophrenia using benign treatments. The CHADS programme has identified several markers that may index early pathophysiology and constitute potential targets for preventative intervention.",

        "abstract": "Instances of sudden and unexpected death while in police custody remain complex and controversial cases in forensic pathology, and provide unique diagnostic challenges. In general, the circumstances of these cases have resulted in two major theories to account for these deaths: \"excited delirium syndrome\", and positional (restraint) asphyxia. However, some cases that are not easily explained by one of these theories may be best explained by a theory from another emergent area in forensic pathology, non-structural genetic heart disease. We present one such case, a sudden arrhythmic death during struggle/restraint. A 45\u00a0year old man with developmental delay was walking outdoors as part of his daily routine. He was misidentified as a criminal suspect by police officers, who attempted to take him into custody. He resisted this arrest violently. He was taken to the ground, and restrained in a face-down position. Both police and civilian witness state that he was pushing his chest off the ground with his arms, when he suddenly collapsed and died. The interaction with police lasted approximately 3\u00a0min. There was no prior excited delirium. At autopsy, minor external blunt force injuries were observed. The heart showed mild cardiomegaly with concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, and sub-occlusive coronary atherosclerosis. Toxicological testing was negative for common drugs, including cocaine and its metabolites. Post-mortem molecular testing demonstrated this man to be heterozygous for a catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) associated mutation (Phe189Leu) in the calsequestrin 2 (CASQ2) gene. This mutation was classified as a class I mutation (deleterious), that may cause disease in a heterozygous state. The cause of death was given as cardiac arrhythmia precipitated by struggle/restraint in a man with CPVT. This case illustrates the difficulty assigning a scientific cause of death in rare and controversial cases, and the value of the molecular autopsy in identifying disease causing mutations.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: In order to develop a multiplex RT-PCR assay using the GeXP analyser for the simultaneous detection of four different NA serotypes of H5-subtype AIVs, effective to control and reduce H5 subtype of avian influenza outbreak.\nDESIGN: Six pairs of primers were designed using conserved and specific sequences of the AIV subtypes H5, N1, N2, N6 and N8 in GenBank. Each gene-specific primer was fused at the 5' end to a universal sequence to generate six pairs of chimeric primers, and one pair of universal primers was used for RT-PCR, and PCR product separation and detection were performed by capillary electrophoresis using the GenomeLab GeXP genetic analysis system.\nSETTING: Single and mixed avian pathogen cDNA/DNA templates were employed to evaluate the specificity of a multiplex assay with a GeXP analyser. Corresponding specific DNA products were amplified for each gene, revealing amplification peaks for M, H5, N1, N2, N6 and N8 genes from four different NA subtypes of influenza A H5 virus.\nSAMPLE: A total of 180 cloacal swabs were collected from poultry at live bird markets.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The multiplex PCR assay demonstrated excellent specificity, with each pair of specific primers generating only products corresponding to the target genes and without cross-amplification with other NA-subtype influenza viruses or other avian pathogens. Using various premixed ssRNAs containing known AIV target genes, the detection limit for the multiplex assay was determined to be 10(2) copies/\u03bcl. The GeXP assay was further evaluated using 180 clinical specimens and compared with RRT-PCR (real-time reverse transcriptase PCR) and virus isolation.\nCONCLUSIONS: This GeXP analyser-based multiplex assay for four different NA subtypes of H5 HPAI viruses is both highly specific and sensitive and can be used as a rapid and direct diagnostic assay for testing clinical samples.",

Consequently, routine screening involves limited markers with established clinical relevance.

        "abstract": "In the construction of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) from two divergent inbred parents certain genotype (or epigenotype) combinations may be functionally \"incompatible\" when brought together in the genomes of the progeny, thus resulting in sterility or lower fertility. Natural selection against these epistatic combinations during inbreeding can change haplotype frequencies and distort linkage disequilibrium (LD) relations between loci on the same or on different chromosomes. These LD distortions have received increased experimental attention, because they point to genomic regions that may drive a Dobzhansky-Muller type of reproductive isolation and, ultimately, speciation in the wild. Here we study the selection signatures of two-locus epistatic incompatibility models and quantify their impact on the genetic composition of the genomes of two-way RILs obtained by selfing. We also consider the biases introduced by breeders when trying to counteract the loss of lines by selectively propagating only viable seeds. Building on our theoretical results, we develop model-based maximum-likelihood (ML) tests that can be applied to multilocus RIL genotype data to infer the precise mode of incompatibility as well as the relative fitness of incompatible loci. We illustrate this ML approach in the context of two published Arabidopsis thaliana RIL panels.

The index case's sister, without ocular manifestations, asked for genetic counseling. The study of the mentioned mutation by Sanger sequencing identified it in an apparent homoplasmic state. However, by means of next-generation sequencing (NGS), the mutation was actually in a heteroplasmic state.\nCONCLUSIONS: Regarding genetic counseling, verifying a mutation in homoplasmic state is really important.

        "abstract": "Conditions experienced in early developmental stages can have long-term consequences for individual fitness. High intraspecific density during the natal period can affect juvenile and eventually adult growth rates, metabolism, immune function, survival, and fecundity. Despite the important ecological and evolutionary effects of early developmental density, the form of the relationship between natal density and resulting juvenile phenotype is poorly understood. To test competing hypotheses explaining responses to intraspecific density, we experimentally manipulated the initial larval density of ringed salamanders (Ambystoma annulatum), a pond-breeding amphibian, over 11 densities. We modeled the functional form of the relationship between natal density and juvenile traits, and compared the relative support for the various hypotheses based on their goodness of fit. These functional form models were then used to parameterize a simple simulation model of population growth. Our data support non-additive density dependence and presents an alternate hypothesis to additive density dependence, self-thinning and Allee effects in larval amphibians. We posit that ringed salamander larvae may be under selective pressure for tolerance to high density and increased efficiency in resource utilization. Additionally, we demonstrate that models of population dynamics are sensitive to assumptions of the functional form of density dependence.",

We also provided the first piece of evidence that low level of BMPRIB was a promoting factor for breast cancer patients to develop bone metastasis, but not lung, liver or brain. The first of its kind, we reported that patients with high expression of BMPRIB exhibited favorable prognosis by a retrospective analysis consisting of 168 patients treated with TE (taxane and anthracycline) regimens. And the patients with high expression of BMPRIB were more sensitive to TE regimens in the detection of 32 paired pre-neoadjuvant and post-neoadjuvant specimens.

Few indicators were empirically validated; most studies relied on medical record review to measure indicators.\nCONCLUSIONS: Many quantitative indicators have been used to measure L&D care quality, but few have been validated beyond expert opinion.

Past work in this area has been extensively reviewed by us and others. Thus, the purpose and scope of the present review is to survey the advancement reported in the last 3years, with focus on innovative delivery systems that appear to afford openings for future developments. These systems exploit the labelling with conventional and novel integrin ligands for targeting the interface of cancer cells and of endothelial cells involved in cancer angiogenesis, with the proteins of the extracellular matrix, in the circulation, in tissues, and in tumour stroma, as the site of progression and metastatic evolution of the disease. Furthermore, these systems implement the expertise in the development of nanomedicines to the purpose of achieving preferential biodistribution and uptake in cancer tissues, internalisation in cancer cells, and release of the transported drugs at intracellular sites. The assessment of the value of controlling these factors, and their combination, for future developments requires support of biological testing in appropriate mechanistic models, but also imperatively demand confirmation in therapeutically relevant in vivo models for biodistribution, efficacy, and lack of off-target effects. Thus, among many studies, we have tried to point out the results supported by relevant in vivo studies, and we have emphasised in specific sections those addressing the medical needs of drug delivery to brain tumours, as well as the delivery of oligonucleotides modulating gene-dependent pathological mechanism. The latter could constitute the basis of a promising third branch in the therapeutic armamentarium against cancer, in addition to antibody-based agents and to cytotoxic agents.",

        "abstract": "Embryogenesis is remarkably robust to segregating mutations and environmental variation; under a range of conditions, embryos of a given species develop into stereotypically patterned organisms. Such robustness is thought to be conferred, in part, through elements within regulatory networks that perform similar, redundant tasks. Redundant enhancers (or \"shadow\" enhancers), for example, can confer precision and robustness to gene expression, at least at individual, well-studied loci. However, the extent to which enhancer redundancy exists and can thereby have a major impact on developmental robustness remains unknown. Here, we systematically assessed this, identifying over 1,000 predicted shadow enhancers during Drosophila mesoderm development. The activity of 23 elements, associated with five genes, was examined in transgenic embryos, while natural structural variation among individuals was used to assess their ability to buffer against genetic variation. Our results reveal three clear properties of enhancer redundancy within developmental systems. First, it is much more pervasive than previously anticipated, with 64% of loci examined having shadow enhancers. Their spatial redundancy is often partial in nature, while the non-overlapping function may explain why these enhancers are maintained within a population. Second, over 70% of loci do not follow the simple situation of having only two shadow enhancers-often there are three (rols), four (CadN and ade5), or five (Traf1), at least one of which can be deleted with no obvious phenotypic effects. Third, although shadow enhancers can buffer variation, patterns of segregating variation suggest that they play a more complex role in development than generally considered.",

However, previously developed injectable matrices often suffer from low bioactivity or poor mechanical properties. To address this need, we introduced a biohybrid temperature-responsive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) PNIPAAm-Gelatin-based injectable hydrogel with excellent bioactivity as well as mechanical robustness for cardiac tissue engineering. A unique feature of our work was that we performed extensive in vitro biological analyses to assess the functionalities of cardiomyocytes (CMs) alone and in co-culture with cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) (2:1 ratio) within the hydrogel matrix. The synthesized hydrogel exhibited viscoelastic behavior (storage modulus: 1260 Pa) and necessary water content (75%) to properly accommodate the cardiac cells. The encapsulated cells demonstrated a high level of cell survival (90% for co-culture condition, day 7) and spreading throughout the hydrogel matrix in both culture conditions. A dense network of stained F-actin fibers (\u223c 6 \u00d7 10(4) \u03bcm(2) area coverage, co-culture condition) illustrated the formation of an intact and three dimensional (3D) cell-embedded matrix.

Three putative QTLs for SDM resistance were located on chromosomes 3 (bin 3.01), 6 (bin 6.01) and 2 (bin 2.02) using composite interval mapping. The locus on chromosome 3 had a major effect and explained up to 12.6% of the phenotypic variation. The other two QTLs on chromosomes 6 and 2 had minor effects with phenotypic variation of 7.1 and 2%. The three QTLs appeared to have additive effects on resistance. The QTLs on chromosomes 3 and 6 were successfully used in the marker-assisted selection programme for introgression of resistance to SDM in eight susceptible maize lines.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is influenced by genetic as well as environmental factors. Its incidence has risen considerably since the 1950s.\nOBJECTIVE: This study investigates T1DM time trends from 1989 to 2008 and tries to establish whether breast/bottle feeding, a family history of diabetes, and childhood infectious diseases influence age at onset.\nMETHODS: The study used the population-based registry of childhood diabetes of Abruzzo (central Italy), which includes incident cases of patients aged less than 15\u2009yr. The pooled 1989-2008 global ascertainment of the registry was 95%. The trend was estimated using age-period-cohort models RESULTS: Overall standardized incidence rates (SIR) increased by 73.38% from 8.94 (1989-1993) to 15.50 (2004-2008). A rising trend was found in all age groups; annual rises were significant for the overall population (3.40%, p\u2009<\u20090.01) and for 5-9\u2009yr olds (5.48%, p\u2009<\u20090.01). SIR increased in males by 106.26%, from 9.26 in 1989-1993 to 19.10 in 2004-2008. Early T1DM onset was related to mixed feeding (6.80\u2009yr\u2009\u00b1\u20093.58 vs 8.20\u2009\u00b1\u20093.81\u2009yr; p\u2009=\u20090.002), and a family history of T1DM (6.71\u2009\u00b1\u20093.96\u2009yr vs. 8.09\u2009\u00b1\u20093.77\u2009yr; p\u2009=\u20090.014), whereas multiple infections delayed age at onset (9.71\u2009\u00b1\u20092.37\u2009yr vs 7.71\u2009\u00b1\u20092.82\u2009yr; p\u2009=\u20090.03).\nCONCLUSIONS: T1DM incidence exhibits a rising time trend that is particularly evident in males and in middle age group; mixed feeding and a family history of diabetes are associated with early onset, multiple bacterial infections contracted before diabetes are associated with a significant delay.",

        "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is the second most common hereditary genetic disease in humans and has elevated mortality. DMD is an X-linked, life-limiting progressive muscle-wasting disease found predominantly in boys and young men. One of the main treatments for patients with DMD is corticosteroids. However, long-term use may cause major side effects such as obesity, a reduction in vitamin D, and osteoporosis. Sleep-disordered breathing is a common condition among patients with DMD, especially obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). In children, OSA is associated with obesity and a reduction of vitamin D concentration. In this article we aim to explore the interrelationship that exists between corticosteroids, obesity, OSA, and the risk of osteoporosis. Our main hypothesis is that factors such as nutrition and sleep are related to obesity and OSA, respectively. In addition, the chronic use of corticosteroids, obesity, and OSA are factors that can reduce serum levels of vitamin D, triggering osteoporosis. Thus, these factors play a key role in affecting the quality of life for patients with DMD and intervention based on these aspects may improve survival.",

        "abstract": "The pace and direction of evolution in response to selection, drift, and mutation are governed by the genetic architecture that underlies trait variation. Consequently, much of evolutionary theory is predicated on assumptions about whether genes can be considered to act in isolation, or in the context of their genetic background. Evolutionary biologists have disagreed, sometimes heatedly, over which assumptions best describe evolution in nature. Methods for estimating genetic architectures that favor simpler (i.e., additive) models contribute to this debate. Here we address one important source of bias, model selection in line cross analysis (LCA). LCA estimates genetic parameters conditional on the best model chosen from a vast model space using relatively few line means. Current LCA approaches often favor simple models and ignore uncertainty in model choice. To address these issues we introduce Software for Analysis of Genetic Architecture (SAGA), which comprehensively assesses the potential model space, quantifies model selection uncertainty, and uses model weighted averaging to accurately estimate composite genetic effects. Using simulated data and previously published LCA studies, we demonstrate the utility of SAGA to more accurately define the components of complex genetic architectures, and show that traditional approaches have underestimated the importance of epistasis.",

Asthmatic women were recruited from the antenatal clinic and were followed prospectively with visits at 12, 20, 28 and 36 weeks gestation. A new nurse-led AMS was introduced offering asthma self-management education and support. Outcomes were compared between women recruited before and after the AMS was introduced (n=89 and 80, respectively) and included; prevalence of exacerbations during pregnancy, asthma control throughout pregnancy and perinatal outcomes, including preterm birth and small-for-gestational-age (SGA).\nRESULTS: The relative risk for exacerbations (0.69; CI: 0.33-1.42), loss of control (0.67; CI 0.46-0.99) and persistent uncontrolled asthma (0.48; CI 0.26-0.9) were all reduced with attendance to AMS during pregnancy.

Microsatellite instability was determined using PCR with primers which flank microsatellite region BAT-26.\nRESULTS: A tendency to a decreased expression of both MSH2 and MLH1 markers in a group of EC patients with a family history of cancer as compared with a group without aggregation of cancer in family history was observed (labeling index - LI - was 36.1 \u00b1 8.1% and LI 20.7 \u00b1 9.1% versus LI 48.0 \u00b1 5.8% and 33.8 \u00b1 5.8%, respectively). It was determined that the number of EC patients with tumors deficient by expression of MMR markers was reliably higher in a group of patients with a family history of cancer than in a group of patients without aggregation of cancer in family history (\u0440 < 0.05). It was shown that in a group of EC patients with a family history of cancer, MMR-proficient tumors were detected in 38.5% of cases. Microsatellite instability was determined in 10.7% of EC patients including one patient with aggregation of Lynch-associated tumors in family history.\nCONCLUSION: Family history of cancer of EC patients is associated with malfunctioning of the MMR system as well as may be related to alternative molecular mechanisms.",

        "abstract": "In vitro genotoxicity assessment routinely employs an exogenous metabolic activation mixture to simulate mammalian metabolism. Activation mixtures commonly contain post-mitochondrial liver supernatant (i.e. S9) from chemically induced Sprague Dawley rats. Although Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) test guidelines permit the use of other S9 preparations, assessments rarely employ human-derived S9. The objective of this study is to review and evaluate the use of human-derived S9 for in vitro genetic toxicity assessment. All available published genotoxicity assessments employing human S9 were compiled for analysis. To facilitate comparative analyses, additional matched Ames data using induced rat liver S9 were obtained for certain highly cited chemicals. Historical human and induced rat S9 quality control reports from Moltox were obtained and mined for enzyme activity and mutagenic potency data. Additional in vitro micronucleus data were experimentally generated using human and induced rat S9. The metabolic activity of induced rat S9 was found to be higher than human S9, and linked to high mutagenic potency results. This study revealed that human S9 often yields significantly lower Salmonella mutagenic potency values, especially for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, aflatoxin B1 and heterocyclic amines (~3- to 350-fold). Conversely, assessment with human S9 activation yields higher potency for aromatic amines (~2- to 50-fold). Outliers with extremely high mutagenic potency results were observed in the human S9 data. Similar trends were observed in experimentally generated mammalian micronucleus cell assays, however human S9 elicited potent cytotoxicity L5178Y, CHO and TK6 cell lines. Due to the potential for reduced sensitivity and the absence of a link between enzyme activity levels and mutagenic potency, human liver S9 is not recommended for use alone in in vitro genotoxicity screening assays; however, human S9 may be extremely useful in follow-up tests, especially in the case of chemicals with species-specific metabolic differences, such as aromatic amines.",

        "abstract": "The choice of chemotherapy for patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) depends on disease- and patient-related factors, but there is little guidance on dosing modifications for patients unable to receive the licensed dose. Nab-paclitaxel is a solvent-free form of paclitaxel that uses albumin as a drug carrier and exploits endogenous albumin transport pathways to achieve enhanced drug targeting and tumour penetration with reduced toxicity. It is approved for use at a dose of 260 mg/m(2) every three weeks in adults who have failed first-line treatment for MBC and for whom standard anthracycline-based therapy is not indicated. Emerging data suggest that weekly dosing schedules of nab-paclitaxel may provide clinical benefit in some patients, but the utility of these alternative dosing schedules remains unclear. A panel of breast cancer experts convened to review available literature for nab-paclitaxel in MBC and, taking into account their clinical experience, recommended that alternative dosing schedules may be considered according to the aggressiveness of disease and patient condition as follows: 125 mg/m(2) QW 3/4 (aggressive disease and fit), 100mg/m(2) QW 3/4 (aggressive or indolent disease and unfit). All dosing schedules were considered acceptable for fit patients with indolent disease.

        "abstract": "This article provides an up-to-date review concerning from basic issues of polyploidy to aspects regarding the relevance and role of both natural and artificial polyploids in plant breeding programs. Polyploidy is a major force in the evolution of both wild and cultivated plants. Polyploid organisms often exhibit increased vigor and, in some cases, outperform their diploid relatives in several aspects. This remarkable superiority of polyploids has been the target of many plant breeders in the last century, who have induced polyploidy and/or used natural polyploids in many ways to obtain increasingly improved plant cultivars. Some of the most important consequences of polyploidy for plant breeding are the increment in plant organs (\"gigas\" effect), buffering of deleterious mutations, increased heterozygosity, and heterosis (hybrid vigor). Regarding such features as tools, cultivars have been generated with higher yield levels, improving the product quality and increasing the tolerance to both biotic and abiotic stresses. In some cases, when the crossing between two species is not possible because of differences in ploidy level, polyploids can be used as a bridge for gene transferring between them. In addition, polyploidy often results in reduced fertility due to meiotic errors, allowing the production of seedless varieties. On the other hand, the genome doubling in a newly formed sterile hybrid allows the restoration of its fertility. Based on these aspects, the present review initially concerns the origin, frequency and classification of the polyploids, progressing to show the revolution promoted by the discovery of natural polyploids and polyploidization induction in the breeding program status of distinct crops.",

        "abstract": "Most standard QTL mapping procedures apply to populations derived from the cross of two parents. QTL detected from such biparental populations are rarely relevant to breeding programs because of the narrow genetic basis: only two alleles are involved per locus. To improve the generality and applicability of mapping results, QTL should be detected using populations initiated from multiple parents, such as the multiparent advanced generation intercross (MAGIC) populations. The greatest challenges of QTL mapping in MAGIC populations come from multiple founder alleles and control of the genetic background information. We developed a random-model methodology by treating the founder effects of each locus as random effects following a normal distribution with a locus-specific variance. We also fit a polygenic effect to the model to control the genetic background. To improve the statistical power for a scanned marker, we release the marker effect absorbed by the polygene back to the model. In contrast to the fixed-model approach, we estimate and test the variance of each locus and scan the entire genome one locus at a time using likelihood-ratio test statistics. Simulation studies showed that this method can increase statistical power and reduce type I error compared with composite interval mapping (CIM) and multiparent whole-genome average interval mapping (MPWGAIM). We demonstrated the method using a public Arabidopsis thaliana MAGIC population and a mouse MAGIC population.",

        "abstract": "We developed generalized functional linear models (GFLMs) to perform a meta-analysis of multiple case-control studies to evaluate the relationship of genetic data to dichotomous traits adjusting for covariates. Unlike the previously developed meta-analysis for sequence kernel association tests (MetaSKATs), which are based on mixed-effect models to make the contributions of major gene loci random, GFLMs are fixed models; i.e., genetic effects of multiple genetic variants are fixed. Based on GFLMs, we developed chi-squared-distributed Rao's efficient score test and likelihood-ratio test (LRT) statistics to test for an association between a complex dichotomous trait and multiple genetic variants. We then performed extensive simulations to evaluate the empirical type I error rates and power performance of the proposed tests. The Rao's efficient score test statistics of GFLMs are very conservative and have higher power than MetaSKATs when some causal variants are rare and some are common. When the causal variants are all rare [i.e., minor allele frequencies (MAF) < 0.03], the Rao's efficient score test statistics have similar or slightly lower power than MetaSKATs. The LRT statistics generate accurate type I error rates for homogeneous genetic-effect models and may inflate type I error rates for heterogeneous genetic-effect models owing to the large numbers of degrees of freedom and have similar or slightly higher power than the Rao's efficient score test statistics. GFLMs were applied to analyze genetic data of 22 gene regions of type 2 diabetes data from a meta-analysis of eight European studies and detected significant association for 18 genes (P < 3.10 \u00d7 10(-6)), tentative association for 2 genes (HHEX and HMGA2; P \u2248 10(-5)), and no association for 2 genes, while MetaSKATs detected none. In addition, the traditional additive-effect model detects association at gene HHEX.

        "abstract": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Currently, the only potential curative therapy for myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) is allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT). As alloSCT confers both a short-term mortality risk compared with conservative management, and a longer-term risk of chronic health burden from graft-versus-host disease and other complications, careful patient selection for alloSCT is essential. Here, we review data on disease burden and transplant outcomes in MDS, describing which patients stand to benefit most (and least) from alloSCT. Evidence for timing of alloSCT and modifying tumor burden prior to transplant is also discussed.\nRECENT FINDINGS: Although patients who undergo alloSCT with excess blasts have poorer outcomes than those transplanted with fewer blasts, the effect of clone size in patients with MDS without increased blast proportion is poorly studied, and it is also not yet known whether posttransplant outcomes can be modified with pretransplant therapy such as intensive induction chemotherapy or hypomethylating agent treatment. Randomized data are lacking. Most hematopoietic cells in patients with MDS are clonal, even in cases without increased marrow blast proportion. Certain high-risk point mutations such as TP53 seem to be associated with a worse outcome even when subclonal.\nSUMMARY: Patients with more than 10% blasts should be considered for cytoreductive therapy before transplant, especially if reduced intensity conditioning (alloSCT) is planned. Patients with less than 10% blasts who are appropriate candidates for transplant can proceed straight to transplant, though it appears better to delay transplant for those with lower-risk disease. Hypomethylating agent therapy may be useful as a bridge to transplant. Randomized data are eagerly awaited.",

Of these thawed embryos, 628 underwent SET on Day 3 of embryo development. We measured the influence of several laboratory parameters on blastomere loss after thaw including: cell stage at cryopreservation, blastomere loss post-thaw, ability to resume mitosis and the rate of overnight cleavage.\nRESULTS: There is an association between cell number on day of freeze and embryonic survival post-thaw; 3 cell (77.4%), 4 cell (92.1%), 5 cell (81.4%) and 6 cell (86.5%) embryos (p<0.05). We found a significant association between the rate of overnight cleavage and positive hCG and implantation rate (p-value <0.05), while there is no association with live birth rate (p-value 0.242). Embryos with 100% blastomere survival have significantly higher cleavage rates, positive hCG, implantation and live birth rates than embryos which experienced blastomere loss (p<0.05). However, blastomere survival has no impact on miscarriage rate or the observed newborn birth weight (3.85 \u00b1 0.77 kg).\nCONCLUSIONS: In the present study we demonstrate, for the first time, that although it is optimal to select an embryo with 100% blastomere survival, transfer of an embryo with \u2265 50% blastomeres intact post-thaw does not influence the development of the baby, as indicated by weight at birth.",

MicroRNAs (miRNAs, miRs) are key post-transcriptional regulators that modulate the differentiation and function of skeletal cells by targeting multiple genes in the same or distinct signaling pathways. SNPs in miRNA genes and miRNA binding sites can alter miRNA abundance and mRNA targeting. This review describes the potential impact of miRNA-related SNPs on skeletal phenotype. Although many associations between SNPs and bone mass have been described, this review is limited to gene variants for which a function has been experimentally validated. SNPs in miRNA genes (miR-SNPs) that impair miRNA processing and alter the abundance of mature miRNA are discussed for miR-146a, miR-125a, miR-196a, miR-149 and miR-27a. SNPs in miRNA targeting sites (miR-TS-SNPs) that alter miRNA binding are described for the bone remodeling genes bone morphogenetic protein receptor 1 (Bmpr1), fibroblast growth factor 2 (Fgf2), osteonectin (Sparc) and histone deacetylase 5 (Hdac5). The review highlights two aspects of miRNA-associated SNPs: the mechanism for altering miRNA mediated gene regulation and the potential of miR-associated SNPs to alter osteoblast, osteoclast or chondrocyte differentiation and function. Given the polygenic nature of skeletal diseases like osteoporosis and osteoarthritis, validating the function of additional miRNA-associated SNPs has the potential to enhance our understanding of the genetic determinants of bone mass and predisposition to selected skeletal diseases.",

Screening for mutations in BRCA1 frequently identifies sequence variants of unknown pathogenicity and recent work has aimed to develop methods for determining pathogenicity. We previously observed that tumor DNA methylation can differentiate BRCA1-mutated from BRCA1-wild type tumors. We hypothesized that we could predict pathogenicity of variants based on DNA methylation profiles of tumors that had arisen in carriers of unclassified variants. We selected 150 FFPE breast tumor DNA samples [47 BRCA1 pathogenic mutation carriers, 65 BRCAx (BRCA1-wild type), 38 BRCA1 test variants] and analyzed a subset (n=54) using the Illumina 450K methylation platform, using the remaining samples for bisulphite pyrosequencing validation. Three validated markers (BACH2, C8orf31, and LOC654342) were combined with sequence bioinformatics in a model to predict pathogenicity of 27 variants (independent test set). Predictions were compared with standard multifactorial likelihood analysis. Prediction was consistent for c.5194-12G>A (IVS 19-12 G>A) (P>0.99); 13 variants were considered not pathogenic or likely not pathogenic using both approaches. We conclude that tumor DNA methylation data alone has potential to be used in prediction of BRCA1 variant pathogenicity but is not independent of estrogen receptor status and grade, which are used in current multifactorial models to predict pathogenicity.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Protein kinase CK2 is widely expressed in eukaryotic cells, and plays an important role in cell proliferation, migration, apoptosis, etc. The aim of the current study is to explore how Quinalizarin, a specific CK2 inhibitor, affects the cell proliferation, migration, and apoptosis of different pathological and genetic types of human lung cancer cell lines.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: MTT assays were performed to evaluate the cell viability after being treated by Quinalizarin. Transwell migration assays were used to assess whether Quinalizarin could suppress cell migration. Flow cytometry was employed to test the apoptosis rate of different cells.\nRESULTS: After being treated by Quinalizarin, the viability of different pathological types of lung cancer cells (H446, H460, A549) were significantly suppressed in a time and dose-dependent manner. More interestingly, in a serial of human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines with different epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation status, Quinalizarin was shown to have a much better ability to reduce the viability of cells with EGFR sensitive mutation than those with resistance mutations. Meanwhile, we also found that the cell migration of different pathological types of lung cancer cells (H446, H460, A549) was significantly decreased by Quinalizarin dose-dependently. In addition, the apoptosis rates in those cells were proved to be increased after exposed to Quinalizarin.\nCONCLUSIONS: Quinalizarin, the specific CK2 inhibitor, could reduce cell viability with emphasis on adenocarcinoma cells harboring EGFR sensitive mutation, suppresses migration, and accelerates apoptosis in different human lung cancer cell lines.",

        "title": "Genetic evidence that lower circulating FSH levels lengthen menstrual cycle, increase age at menopause and impact female reproductive health.",
        "abstract": "STUDY QUESTION: How does a genetic variant in the FSHB promoter, known to alter FSH levels, impact female reproductive health?\nSUMMARY ANSWER: The T allele of the FSHB promoter polymorphism (rs10835638; c.-211G>T) results in longer menstrual cycles and later menopause and, while having detrimental effects on fertility, is protective against endometriosis.\nWHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: The FSHB promoter polymorphism (rs10835638; c.-211G>T) affects levels of FSHB transcription and, as a result, circulating levels of FSH. FSH is required for normal fertility and genetic variants at the FSHB locus are associated with age at menopause and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).\nSTUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: We used cross-sectional data from the UK Biobank to look at associations between the FSHB promoter polymorphism and reproductive traits, and performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for length of menstrual cycle.\nPARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: We included white British individuals aged 40-69 years in 2006-2010, in the May 2015 release of genetic data from UK Biobank. We tested the FSH-lowering T allele of the FSHB promoter polymorphism (rs10835638; c.-211G>T) for associations with 29, mainly female, reproductive phenotypes in up to 63 350 women and 56 608 men. We conducted a GWAS in 9534 individuals to identify genetic variants associated with length of menstrual cycle.\nMAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: The FSH-lowering T allele of the FSHB promoter polymorphism (rs10835638; MAF 0.16) was associated with longer menstrual cycles [0.16 SD (c. 1 day) per minor allele; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.12-0.20; P = 6 \u00d7 10(-16)], later age at menopause (0.13 years per minor allele; 95% CI 0.04-0.22; P = 5.7 \u00d7 10(-3)), greater female nulliparity [odds ratio (OR) = 1.06; 95% CI 1.02-1.11; P = 4.8 \u00d7 10(-3)] and lower risk of endometriosis (OR = 0.79; 95% CI 0.69-0.90; P = 4.1 \u00d7 10(-4)). The FSH-lowering T allele was not associated with other female reproductive illnesses or conditions in our study and we did not replicate associations with male infertility or PCOS. In the GWAS for menstrual cycle length, only variants near the FSHB gene reached genome-wide significance (P < 5 \u00d7 10(-9)).\nLIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The data included might be affected by recall bias. Cycle length was not available for 25% of women still cycling (1% did not answer, 6% did not know and for 18% cycle length was recorded as 'irregular'). Women with a cycle length recorded were aged over 40 and were approaching menopause; however, we did not find evidence that this affected the results. Many of the groups with illnesses had relatively small sample sizes and so the study may have been under-powered to detect an effect.\nWIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: We found a strong novel association between a genetic variant that lowers FSH levels and longer menstrual cycles, at a locus previously robustly associated with age at menopause. The variant was also associated with nulliparity and endometriosis risk. These findings should now be verified in a second independent group of patients. We conclude that lifetime differences in circulating levels of FSH between individuals can influence menstrual cycle length and a range of reproductive outcomes, including menopause timing, infertility, endometriosis and PCOS.\nSTUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTERESTS: None.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: Not applicable.",

        "title": "5-HT2C receptors in psychiatric disorders: A review.",
        "abstract": "5-HT2Rs have a different genomic organization from other 5-HT2Rs. 5HT2CR undergoes post-transcriptional pre-mRNA editing generating diversity among RNA transcripts. Selective post-transcriptional editing could be involved in the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders through impairment in G-protein interactions. Moreover, it may influence the therapeutic response to agents such as atypical antipsychotic drugs. Additionally, 5-HT2CR exhibits alternative splicing. Central serotonergic and dopaminergic systems interact to modulate normal and abnormal behaviors. Thus, 5HT2CR plays a crucial role in psychiatric disorders. 5HT2CR could be a relevant pharmacological target in the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders. The development of drugs that specifically target 5-HT2C receptors will allow for better understanding of their involvement in the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia, anxiety, and depression. Among therapeutic means currently available, most drugs used to treat highly morbid psychiatric diseases interact at least partly with 5-HT2CRs. Pharmacologically, 5HT2CRs, have the ability to generate differentially distinct response signal transduction pathways depending on the type of 5HT2CR agonist. Although this receptor property has been clearly demonstrated, in vitro, the eventual beneficial impact of this property opens new perspectives in the development of agonists that could activate signal transduction pathways leading to better therapeutic efficiency with fewer adverse effects.",

        "abstract": "STUDY QUESTION: The 15th European IVF-monitoring (EIM) report presents the results of treatments involving assisted reproductive technology (ART) initiated in Europe during 2011: are there any changes in the trends compared with previous years?\nSUMMARY ANSWER: Despite some fluctuations in the number of countries reporting data, while the overall number of ART cycles has continued to increase year by year, the pregnancy rates in 2011 decreased slightly to those reported in 2010, and the number of transfers with multiple embryos (3+) and the multiple delivery rates declined.\nWHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Since 1997, ART data in Europe have been collected and reported in 14 manuscripts, published in Human Reproduction.\nSTUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Retrospective data collection of European ART data by the EIM Consortium for the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE); cycles started between 1 January and 31 December 2011 are collected on a yearly basis. The data are collected by National Registers, when existing, or on a voluntary basis by personal information.\nPARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS SETTING, METHODS: From 33 countries (+2 compared with 2010), 1064 clinics reported 609 973 treatment cycles including: IVF 138 592, ICSI 298 918, frozen embryo replacement (FER) 129 693, egg donation (ED) 30 198, in vitro maturation 511, preimplantation genetic diagnosis/screening 6824 and frozen oocyte replacements 5237. European data on intrauterine insemination (IUI) using husband/partner's semen (IUI-H) and donor semen (IUI-D) were reported from 861 IUI laboratories in 24 countries. A total of 174 390 IUI-H and 41 151 IUI-D cycles were included.\nMAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: In 17 countries where all clinics reported to the ART register, a total of 361 972 ART cycles were performed in a population of 285 million inhabitants, corresponding to 1269 cycles per million inhabitants. For all IVF cycles, the clinical pregnancy rates per aspiration and per transfer were stable with 29.1 and 33.2%, respectively, and for ICSI, the corresponding rates also were stable with 27.9 and 31.8%, respectively. In FER cycles, the pregnancy rate per thawing increased to 21.3% if compared with previous years. In ED cycles, the pregnancy rate per fresh transfer decreased to 45.8% (47.4% in 2010) and increased to 33.6% (33.3% in 2010) per thawed transfer. The delivery rate after IUI-H decreased to 8.3 (8.9 in 2010), and to 12.2% (13.8% in 2010) after IUI-D. In IVF and ICSI cycles, 1, 2, 3 and 4+ embryos were transferred in 27.5, 56.7, 14.5 and 1.3% of cycles, respectively. The proportions of singleton, twin and triplet deliveries after IVF and ICSI (added together) were 80.8, 18.6 and 0.6%, respectively, resulting in a total multiple delivery rate of 19.2% compared with 20.6% in 2010, 20.2% in 2009, 21.7% in 2008, 22.3% in 2007 and 20.8% in 2006. In FER cycles, the multiple delivery rate was 13.2% (12.8% twins and 0.4% triplets). Twin and triplet delivery rates associated with IUI cycles were 9.7/0.6% and 7.3/0.3%, following IUI-H and IUI-D treatment, respectively.\nLIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The method of reporting varies among countries, and registers from a number of countries have been unable to provide some of the relevant data such as initiated cycles and deliveries. As long as data are incomplete and generated through different methods of collection, results should be interpreted with caution.\nWIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: The 15th ESHRE report on ART shows a continuing expansion of the number of treatment cycles in Europe, with more than 600 000 cycles reported in 2011. Since 2006, the proportion of IVF to ICSI cycles has reached a plateau after a small decrease in 2009. Pregnancy and delivery rates after IVF remained relatively stable compared with 2010 and 2009. The pregnancy rate per aspiration in ICSI cycles declined for the first time by 0.9%. The multiple delivery rate is lower than ever before.\nSTUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTERESTS: The study had no external funding; all costs are covered by ESHRE. There are no competing interests.",

        "abstract": "Congenital insensitivity to pain (CIP) comprises the rare heritable disorders without peripheral neuropathy that feature inability to feel pain. Fracturing and joint destruction are common complications, but lack detailed studies of mineral and skeletal homeostasis and bone histology. In 2013, discovery of a heterozygous gain-of-function mutation in SCN11A encoding voltage-gated sodium channel 1.9 (Nav1.9) established a distinctive CIP in three unrelated patients who suffered multiple painless fractures, self-inflicted mutilation, chronic diarrhea, and hyperhidrosis. Here, we studied a mother and two children with CIP by physical examination, biochemical testing, radiological imaging including DXA, iliac crest histology, and mutation analysis. She suffered fractures primarily of her lower extremities beginning at age two years, and had Charcot deformity of both ankles and joint hypermobility. Nerve conduction velocity together with electromyography were normal. Her children had recurrent major fractures beginning in early childhood, joint hypermobility, and chronic diarrhea. She had an excoriated external nare, and both children had hypertrophic scars from scratching. Skin collagen studies were normal. Radiographs revealed fractures and deformities. However, lumbar spine and total hip BMD Z-scores, biochemical parameters of mineral and skeletal homeostasis, and iliac crest histology of the mother (after in vivo tetracycline labeling) were normal. Genomic DNA from the children revealed a unique heterozygous missense mutation in exon 23 (c.3904C>T, p.Leu1302Phe) of SCN11A that is absent in SNP databases and alters an evolutionarily conserved amino acid. This autosomal dominant CIP reflects the second gain-of-function mutation of SCN11A. Perhaps joint hypermobility is an unreported feature. How mutation of Nav1.9 causes fracturing remains unexplained. Lack of injury awareness is typically offered as the reason, and was supported by our unremarkable biochemical, radiological, and histological findings indicating no skeletal pathobiology. However, low-trauma fracturing in these patients suggests an uncharacterized defect in bone quality.",

        "abstract": "Background Detection of disease-associated mutations in patients with familial hypercholesterolaemia is crucial for early interventions to reduce risk of cardiovascular disease. Screening for these mutations represents a methodological challenge since more than 1200 different causal mutations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor has been identified. A number of methodological approaches have been developed for screening by clinical diagnostic laboratories. Methods Using primers targeting, the low-density lipoprotein receptor, apolipoprotein B, and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9, we developed a novel Ion Torrent-based targeted re-sequencing method. We validated this in a West Midlands-UK small cohort of 58 patients screened in parallel with other mutation-targeting methods, such as multiplex polymerase chain reaction (Elucigene FH20), oligonucleotide arrays (Randox familial hypercholesterolaemia array) or the Illumina next-generation sequencing platform. Results In this small cohort, the next-generation sequencing method achieved excellent analytical performance characteristics and showed 100% and 89% concordance with the Randox array and the Elucigene FH20 assay. Investigation of the discrepant results identified two cases of mutation misclassification of the Elucigene FH20 multiplex polymerase chain reaction assay. A number of novel mutations not previously reported were also identified by the next-generation sequencing method. Conclusions Ion Torrent-based next-generation sequencing can deliver a suitable alternative for the molecular investigation of familial hypercholesterolaemia patients, especially when comprehensive mutation screening for rare or unknown mutations is required.",

        "abstract": "The selective history of a population can influence its subsequent evolution, an effect known as historical contingency. We previously observed that five of six replicate populations that were evolved in a glucose-limited environment for 2000 generations, then switched to lactose for 1000 generations, had higher fitness increases in lactose than populations started directly from the ancestor. To test if selection in glucose systematically increased lactose evolvability, we started 12 replay populations--six from a population subsample and six from a single randomly selected clone--from each of the six glucose-evolved founder populations. These replay populations and 18 ancestral populations were evolved for 1000 generations in a lactose-limited environment. We found that replay populations were initially slightly less fit in lactose than the ancestor, but were more evolvable, in that they increased in fitness at a faster rate and to higher levels. This result indicates that evolution in the glucose environment resulted in genetic changes that increased the potential of genotypes to adapt to lactose. Genome sequencing identified four genes--iclR, nadR, spoT, and rbs--that were mutated in most glucose-evolved clones and are candidates for mediating increased evolvability. Our results demonstrate that short-term selective costs during selection in one environment can lead to changes in evolvability that confer longer term benefits.",

Case-controls were matched for BW, gestational age and date of birth, (SPSS v17.0 software, using Student's t test, X2 test, and Mann-Whitney U test were used for statistical analysis.\nCONCLUSION: The prevalence rate of ELBW infants (< \u200a750 grams) with AKI admitted at CHMCA NICU from 1998 to 2008 was 26% . The mortality rate of ELBW infants (< \u200a750 grams) with AKI was 54% , compared to 20% in those ELBW infants who did not have AKI. The associated risk factors of AKI in the ELBW infants (< \u200a750 grams) were as follows: presence of maternal placental abruption/bleeding, grade III or IV IVH, PDA, positive culture/s, NEC, use of steroid, nephrotoxic drugs, and longer use of the ventilator and TPN.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of a quality improvement (QI) program of delayed umbilical cord clamping (DCC) in multiple and singleton preterm infants born at our center.\nMETHODS: After DCC protocol implementation, compliance and success rate were assessed. Clinical outcomes of selected 150 preterm infants <34 weeks gestation born in 2014 after protocol implementation (Epoch II) were compared to those of preterm infants born in 2013 before protocol implementation (Epoch I).\nRESULTS: Overall protocol compliance rate was 92% (246/267). DCC was successfully performed in 77% (205/267) after protocol implementation. There were higher multiple births in Epoch II compared to Epoch I (27.3 vs. 15.3% , p\u200a< \u200a0.01). At birth, infants in Epoch II had significantly decreased need for intubation in delivery room (23.3 vs. 39.3% , p\u200a< \u200a0.01), had higher hematocrit (46.4\u00b17.3 vs. 44.0\u00b17.1% , p\u200a< \u200a0.01) and less metabolic acidosis (base excess -4.1\u00b12.7 vs. -5.3\u00b14.2\u200ammol/L, p\u200a< \u200a0.01) compared to those born in Epoch I. During hospital stay, fewer infants in Epoch II received rescue surfactant therapy (45.3 vs. 56.7% , p\u200a=\u200a0.05), medical treatment for PDA (6.7 vs. 16.6% , p\u200a=\u200a0.04%) and red blood cell transfusions (20.7 VS. 32.0% , p\u200a< \u200a0.01) compared to Epoch I.\nCONCLUSIONS: Protocol-guided practice of DCC for 30 seconds can be safely performed in multiple and singleton preterm infants. In addition to higher initial hematocrit, infants in our QI project had lower need for delivery room resuscitation and less metabolic acidosis at birth. We also observed decreased need for rescue surfactant therapy, medical treatment for PDA and red blood cell transfusions after DCC protocol implementation.",

All infants with isolated VBS without clinical signs, radiological pneumatosis and abnormal laboratory results were included. The template and VBS-AT instrument were implemented at the bedside. Criteria for discontinuation of contact precautions and readiness for discharge home were defined apriori.\nRESULTS: Eight infants developed VBS during the cluster lasting ten days. Seventy-four (78%) of the 98 episodes were graded by the VBS-AT. Five of the six infants had a maximum VBS grade of 3. The duration of VBS and contact precautions ranged from 4-38 days. All six infants with a VBS grade \u22642 for 4 consecutive days did not deteriorate beyond grade \u22653 or develop gastrointestinal complications during the ten week period following the end of the cluster. Consistent objective reporting of the severity of VBS and consistent evaluation of infants' progress over time contained the cluster effectively and facilitated discharge of stable infants.\nCONCLUSIONS: Implementation of a tool to standardize, investigate and objectively monitor the severity of VBS is feasible and improves effectiveness of care at no extra cost.",

In addition to the disruption of primary DNA sequence, the modulation of DNA function by epigenetic phenomena, in particular by DNA methylation, has long been known to play a role in the regulation of gene expression and consequent pathogenesis. However, these epigenetic factors have been identified only in a handful of pediatric conditions, including imprinting disorders. Technological advances in the past decade that have revolutionized clinical genomics are now rapidly being applied to the emerging discipline of clinical epigenomics. Here, we present an overview of epigenetic mechanisms with a focus on DNA modifications, including the molecular mechanisms of DNA methylation and subtypes of DNA modifications, and we describe the classic and emerging genomic technologies that are being applied to this study. This review focuses primarily on constitutional epigenomic conditions associated with a spectrum of developmental and intellectual disabilities. Epigenomic disorders are discussed in the context of global genomic disorders, imprinting disorders, and single gene disorders. We include a section focused on integration of genetic and epigenetic mechanisms together with their effect on clinical phenotypes.

        "abstract": "The theory of fetal origins of adult disease was first proposed in 1989, and in the decades since, a wide range of other diseases from obesity to asthma have been found to originate in early development. Because mammalian oocyte development begins in fetal life it has been suggested that environmental and lifestyle factors of the mother could directly impact the fertility of subsequent generations. Cigarette smoke is a known ovotoxicant in active smokers, yet disturbingly 13% of Australian and 12% of US women continue to smoke throughout pregnancy. The focus of our investigation was to characterize the adverse effects of smoking on ovary and oocyte quality in female offspring exposed in utero. Pregnant mice were nasally exposed to cigarette smoke for 12 wk throughout pregnancy/lactation, and ovary and oocyte quality of the F1 (maternal smoke exposed) generation was examined. Neonatal ovaries displayed abnormal somatic cell proliferation and increased apoptosis, leading to a reduction in follicle numbers. Further investigation found that altered somatic cell proliferation and reduced follicle number continued into adulthood; however, apoptosis did not. This reduction in follicles resulted in decreased oocyte numbers, with these oocytes found to have elevated levels of oxidative stress, altered metaphase II spindle, and reduced sperm-egg interaction. These ovarian and oocyte changes ultimately lead to subfertility, with maternal smoke-exposed animals having smaller litters and also taking longer to conceive. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that in utero and lactational exposure to cigarette smoke can have long-lasting effects on the fertility of the next generation of females.",

Of the 216 women, 38 women were reclassified into a mild GDM (mGDM) group according to the IADPSG criteria. Of the remaining 178 women, 135 women with normal 50-g glucose challenge test were reclassified into a normal glucose tolerance (NGT) group.

The incidence of large-for-gestational age (LGA) newborns was higher in the mGDM than in the NGT group. No differences in cord blood free IGF-1, IGFBP-1, IGFBP-2 or AdipoQ levels were observed between the mGDM and NGT groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that mild GDM reclassified according to the IADPSG criteria influences neonatal birth size, but neither the IGF-IGFBP axis nor AdipoQ can account for the changes of birth size in offspring of women with mild GDM.",

        "abstract": "New enzyme delivery technologies are required for treatment of lysosomal storage disorders with significant pathologies associated with the so-called \"hard-to-treat\" tissues and organs. Genetic deficiencies in the GLB1 gene encoding acid \u03b2-galactosidase lead to GM1-gangliosidosis or Morquio B, lysosomal diseases with predominant disease manifestation associated with the central nervous system or skeletal system, respectively. Current lysosomal ERTs are delivered into cells based on receptor-mediated endocytosis and do not effectively address several hard-to-treat organs including those critical for GM1-gangliosidosis patients. Lectins provide alternative cell-uptake mechanisms based on adsorptive-mediated endocytosis and thus may provide unique biodistribution for lysosomal disease therapeutics. In the current study, genetic fusions of the plant galactose/galactosamine-binding lectin, RTB, and the human acid \u03b2-galactosidase enzyme were produced using a plant-based bioproduction platform. \u03b2-gal:RTB and RTB:\u03b2-gal fusion products retained both lectin activity and \u03b2-galactosidase activity. Purified proteins representing both fusion orientations were efficiently taken up into GM1 patient fibroblasts and mediated the reduction of GM1 ganglioside substrate with activities matching mammalian cell-derived \u03b2-galactosidase. In contrast, plant-derived \u03b2-gal alone was enzymatically active but did not mediate uptake or correction indicating the need for either lectin-based (plant product) or mannose-6-phosphate-based (mammalian product) delivery. Native \u03b2-galactosidase undergoes catalytic activation (cleavage within the C-terminal region) in lysosomes and is stabilized by association with protective protein/cathepsin A. Enzymatic activity and lysosomal protein processing of the RTB fusions were assessed following internalization into GM1 fibroblasts. Within 1-4h, both \u03b2-gal:RTB and RTB:\u03b2-gal were processed to the ~64kDa \"activated\" \u03b2-gal form; the RTB lectin was cleaved and rapidly degraded. The activated \u03b2-gal was still detected at 48h suggesting interactions with protective protein/cathepsin A. Uptake-saturation analyses indicated that the RTB adsorptive-mediated mechanisms of \u03b2-gal:RTB supported significantly greater accumulation of \u03b2-galactose activity in fibroblasts compared to the receptor-mediated mechanisms of the mammalian cell-derived \u03b2-gal. These data demonstrate that plant-made \u03b2-gal:RTB functions as an effective replacement enzyme for GM1-gangliosidosis - delivering enzyme into cells, enabling essential lysosomal processing, and mediating disease substrate clearance at the cellular level. RTB provides novel uptake behaviors and thus may provide new receptor-independent strategies that could broadly impact lysosomal disease treatments.",

        "abstract": "Four decades ago, it was proposed that environmental sex determination (ESD) evolves when individual fitness depends on the environment in a sex-specific fashion--a form of condition-dependent sex allocation. Many biological processes have been hypothesized to drive this sex asymmetry, yet a general explanation for the evolution of sex-determining mechanisms remains elusive. Here, we develop a mathematical model for a novel hypothesis of the evolution of ESD, and provide a first empirical test using data across turtles. ESD is favored when the sex-determining environment affects annual survival rates equivalently in males and females, and males and females mature at different ages. We compare this hypothesis to alternative hypotheses, and demonstrate how it captures a crucially different process. This maturation process arises naturally from common life histories and applies more broadly to condition-dependent sex allocation. Therefore, it has widespread implications for animal taxa. Across turtle species, ESD is associated with greater sex differences in the age at maturity compared to species without ESD, as predicted by our hypothesis. However, the effect is not statistically significant and will require expanded empirical investigation. Given variation among taxa in sex-specific age at maturity, our survival-to-maturity hypothesis may capture common selective forces on sex-determining mechanisms.",

        "abstract": "Sexual size dimorphism (SSD) describes divergent body sizes of adult males and females. While SSD has traditionally been explained by sexual and fecundity selection, recent advances in physiology and developmental biology emphasize that SSD would occur proximately because of sexual differences in ontogenetic growth trajectories (i.e., growth rate and duration). Notably, these ontogenetic traits are subject to energetic or time constraints and thus traded off with fitness components (e.g., survival and reproduction). To elucidate the importance of such ontogenetic trade-offs in the evolution of SSD, we developed a new theoretical framework by extending quantitative genetic models for the evolution of sexual dimorphism in which we reinterpret the trait as body size and reformulate sex-specific fitness in size-dependent manners. More specifically, we assume that higher growth rate or longer growth duration leads to larger body size and higher reproductive success but incurs the cost of lower survivorship or shorter reproduction period. We illustrate how two sexes would optimize ontogenetic growth trajectories in sex-specific ways and exhibit divergent body sizes. The present framework provides new insights into the evolutionary theory of SSD and predictions for empirical testing.",

        "abstract": "Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva is a rare genetic disorder characterized by progressive heterotopic ossification. FOP patients develop soft tissue lumps as a result of inflammation-induced flare-ups which leads to the irreversible replacement of skeletal muscle tissue with bone tissue. Classical FOP patients possess a mutation (c.617G>A; R206H) in the ACVR1-encoding gene which leads to dysregulated BMP signaling. Nonetheless, not all FOP patients with this mutation exhibit equal severity in symptom presentation or disease progression which indicates a strong contribution by environmental factors. Given the pro-inflammatory role of TGF\u03b2, we studied the role of TGF\u03b2 in the progression of osteogenic differentiation in primary dermal fibroblasts from five classical FOP patients based on a novel method of platelet lysate-based osteogenic transdifferentiation. During the course of transdifferentiation the osteogenic properties of the cells were evaluated by the mRNA expression of Sp7/Osterix, Runx2, Alp, OC and the presence of mineralization. During transdifferentiation the expression of osteoblast markers Runx2 (p<0.05) and Alp were higher in patient cells compared to healthy controls. All cell lines exhibited increase in mineralisation. FOP fibroblasts also expressed higher baseline Sp7/Osterix levels (p<0.05) confirming their higher osteogenic potential. The pharmacological inhibition of TGF\u03b2 signaling during osteogenic transdifferentiation resulted in the attenuation of osteogenic transdifferentiation in all cell lines as shown by the decrease in the expression of Runx2 (p<0.05), Alp and mineralization. We suggest that blocking of TGF\u03b2 signaling can decrease the osteogenic transdifferentiation of FOP fibroblasts.",

The cases with a normal QF-PCR result were analyzed by CMA.\nRESULTS: Of the 175 cases, common aneuploidies were detected by QF-PCR in 53 (30.2%) cases (30 cases of trisomy 21, 12 cases of monosomy X, 7 cases of trisomy 18, 3 cases of trisomy 13 and 1 case of 47, XXY). Among the 122 cases with a normal QF-PCR result, microarray detected additional pathogenic copy number variants (CNVs) in 5.7% (7/122) of cases. Four cases would have expected to be detectable by conventional karyotyping because of large deletions/duplications (>10 Mb), leaving three cases (2.5%; 3/118) with pathogenic CNVs only detectable by CMA.\nCONCLUSION: It is rational to use a diagnostic strategy in which CMA is preceded by the less expensive, rapid, QF-PCR to detect common aneuploidies.

        "abstract": "Depending on populations, 15 to 40% of patients have a familial form of Paget's disease of bone (PDB), which is transmitted in an autosomal-dominant mode of inheritance with incomplete penetrance. To date, only SQSTM1 gene mutations have been linked to the disease. Several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been associated with PDB in patient non-carriers of SQSTM1 mutations, but they have minor size effects. The current clinical practice guidelines still recommend to measure total serum alkaline phosphatase (sALP) for PDB screening. However, genetic or bone biomarkers alone may lack sensitivity to detect PDB. Thus, the objective of this study was to develop a molecular test of PDB, combining genetic and bone biomarkers, in order to detect PDB, which is frequently asymptomatic. We genotyped 35 SNPs previously associated with PDB in 305 patients, and 292 healthy controls. In addition, serum levels of 14 bone biomarkers were assayed in 51 patients and 151 healthy controls. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression models with adjustment for age and sex were fitted to search for a combination of SNPs and/or bone biomarkers that could best detect PDB in patient non-carriers of SQSTM1 mutations. First, a combination of five genetic markers gave rise to the highest area under the ROC curve (AUC) with 95% confidence interval [95% CI] of 0.731 [0.688; 0.773], which allowed us to detect 81.5% of patients with PDB. Second, a combination of two bone biomarkers had an AUC of 0.822 [0.726; 0.918], and was present in 81.5% of patients with PDB. Then, the combination of the five genetic markers and the two bone biomarkers increased the AUC up to 0.892 [0.833; 0.951], and detected 88.5% of patients with PDB. These results suggested that an algorithm integrating first a screen for SQSTM1 gene mutations, followed by either a genetic markers combination or a combined genetic and biochemical markers test in patients non-carrier of any SQSTM1 mutation, may detect the PDB phenotype better than biomarkers already available in the clinical practice.",

        "abstract": "A panel of published distributions of cell interdivision times (IDT) comprising 77 datasets related to 16 cell types, some studied under different conditions, was used to evaluate their conformance to the exponentially modified gamma distribution (EMGD) in comparison with distributions suggested for IDT data earlier. Lognormal, gamma, inverse Gaussian, and shifted Weibull and gamma distributions were found to be generally inferior to EMGD. Exponentially modified Gaussian (EMG) performed equally well. Although EMGD or EMG may be worse than some other distributions in specific cases, the reason that IDT distributions must be generated by a common mechanism of the cell cycle makes it unlikely that they differ essentially in different cell types. Therefore, exponentially modified peak functions, such as EMGD or EMG, are most appropriate if the use of a single distribution for IDT data is reasonable. EMGD is also shown to be the best descriptive tool for published data on the distribution of times between the bursts of mRNA synthesis at defined genes in single cells. EMG is inadequate to such data because its Gaussian component markedly extends to the negative time domain. The applicability of EMGD to comparable features of cells and genes behaviors are discussed to support the validity of the transition probability model and to relate the exponential component of EMGD to the times of cell dwelling in the restriction point of the cell cycle.",

The development of physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models to predict the effects of drugs in the body facilitates the clinical translation of genomic knowledge and the implementation of in vivo pharmacology experience with pharmacogenomics. Such a direction unequivocally empowers our capacity to also make personalized drug dosage scheme decisions for drugs, including molecularly targeted agents and innovative nanoformulations, i.e. in establishing pharmacotyping in prescription. In this way, the applicability of PBPK models to guide individualized cancer therapeutic decisions of broad clinical utility in nanomedicine in real-time and in a cost-affordable manner will be discussed.

        "abstract": "Dosage compensation is the fundamental process by which gene expression from the male monosomic X chromosome and from the diploid set of autosomes is equalized. Various molecular mechanisms have evolved in different organisms to achieve this task. In Drosophila, genes on the male X chromosome are upregulated to the levels of expression from the two X chromosomes in females. To test whether a similar mechanism is operating in immature stages of Anopheles mosquitoes, we analyzed global gene expression in the Anopheles gambiae fourth instar larvae and pupae using high-coverage RNA-seq data. In pupae of both sexes, the median expression ratios of X-linked to autosomal genes (X:A) were close to 1.0, and within the ranges of expression ratios between the autosomal pairs, consistent with complete compensation. Gene-by-gene comparisons of expression in males and females revealed mild female bias, likely attributable to a deficit of male-biased X-linked genes. In larvae, male to female ratios of the X chromosome expression levels were more female biased than in pupae, suggesting that compensation may not be complete. No compensation mechanism appears to operate in male germline of early pupae. Confirmation of the existence of dosage compensation in A. gambiae lays the foundation for research into the components of dosage compensation machinery in this important vector species.",

We developed a program, \"Ortholog-Finder,\" to obtain ortholog data sets for performing phylogenetic analysis by using all open-reading frame data of species. The program includes five processes for minimizing the effects of HGT and out-paralogs in phylogeny construction: 1) HGT filtering: Genes derived from HGT could be detected and deleted from the initial sequence data set by examining their base compositions. 2) Out-paralog filtering: Out-paralogs are detected and deleted from the data set based on sequence similarity. 3) Classification of phylogenetic trees: Phylogenetic trees generated for ortholog candidates are classified as monophyletic or polyphyletic trees. 4) Tree splitting: Polyphyletic trees are bisected to obtain monophyletic trees and remove HGT genes and out-paralogs. 5) Threshold changing: Out-paralogs are further excluded from the data set based on the difference in the similarity scores of genuine orthologs and out-paralogs. We examined how out-paralogs and HGTs affected phylogenetic trees constructed for species based on ortholog data sets obtained by Ortholog-Finder with the use of simulation data, and we determined the effects of confounding factors. We then used Ortholog-Finder in phylogeny construction for 12 Gram-positive bacteria from two phyla and validated each node of the constructed tree by comparison with individually constructed ortholog trees.",

Studies carried out recently in the Northern Hemisphere revealed the existence of wild populations associated with oak trees in North America, Asia, and in the Mediterranean region. However, in spite of these advances, the global distribution of natural populations of S. cerevisiae, especially in regions were oaks and other members of the Fagaceae are absent, is not well understood. Here we investigate the occurrence of S. cerevisiae in Brazil, a tropical region where oaks and other Fagaceae are absent. We report a candidate natural habitat of S. cerevisiae in South America and, using whole-genome data, we uncover new lineages that appear to have as closest relatives the wild populations found in North America and Japan. A population structure analysis revealed the penetration of the wine genotype into the wild Brazilian population, a first observation of the impact of domesticated microbe lineages on the genetic structure of wild populations. Unexpectedly, the Brazilian population shows conspicuous evidence of hybridization with an American population of Saccharomyces paradoxus. Introgressions from S. paradoxus were significantly enriched in genes encoding secondary active transmembrane transporters. We hypothesize that hybridization in tropical wild lineages may have facilitated the habitat transition accompanying the colonization of the tropical ecosystem.",

In contrast, 96.7% (117/121) of the SUDC group were discovered during a sleep period compared to 53.3% (8/15) of the explained group (p < 0.001), and 48.8% (59/121) of the SUDC cases had a personal and/or family history of febrile seizures compared to 6.7% (1/15) of the explained group (p < 0.001). Of the explained deaths, 56% (9/16) were subclassified as infection, 31% (5/16) cardiac, 6% (1/16) accidental, and 6% (1/16) metabolic. Two of the three cases specifically tested for cardiac channelopathies at autopsy based upon clinical indications had genetic variants in cardiac genes, one of uncertain significance. Bacterial cultures at autopsy typically revealed organisms interpreted as contaminants. Two of the four seizure-related deaths were witnessed, with two of the brains from these cases showing generalized malformations. Hippocampal anomalies, including a specific combination we termed hippocampal maldevelopment associated with sudden death, were found in almost 50% (40/83) of the SUDC and undetermined cases in which hippocampal sections were available.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the key role for the hippocampus, febrile seizures, and sleep in SUDC pathophysiology. It also demonstrates the role of known predisposing conditions such as cardiac channelopathies and infections in causing sudden unexpected death in childhood, and the need for improved ancillary testing and protective strategies in these cases, even when the cause of death is established at autopsy.",

Lentiviral and rhabdoviral pseudotypes are excellent tools for studying enveloped viruses and have contributed to many recent advances in areas such as receptor usage, viral entry and serology. In particular, pseudotypes allow the safe study of unknown or highly pathogenic viruses. They also allow the initial characterization of aspects of infection such as cellular tropism for difficult to culture viruses. In this review we will introduce various pseudotyping systems for emerging viruses, including chikungunya virus, Ebola virus, SARS and MERS coronaviruses and Nipah virus, as well as their use in diverse studies including drug screening and antibody neutralization.

The seminal SCID-X1 clinical studies, based on first-generation gammaretroviral vectors, demonstrated good long-term immune reconstitution in most treated patients despite the occurrence of vector-related leukemia in a few of them. This gene therapy has successfully enabled correction of the T cell defect. Natural killer and B cell defects were only partially restored, most likely due to the absence of a conditioning regimen. The success of these pioneering trials paved the way for the extension of gene-based treatment to many other diseases of the hematopoietic system, but the unfortunate serious adverse events led to extensive investigations to define the retrovirus integration profiles. This review puts into perspective the clinical experience of gene therapy for SCID-X1, with the development and implementation of new generations of safer vectors such as self-inactivating gammaretroviral or lentiviral vectors as well as major advances in integrome knowledge.",

After appropriate specimen and nucleic acid quality control, 80 NGS libraries were prepared using the Illumina TruSight tumor (TST) kit and sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq. Sequence alignment, variant calling, and sequencing quality control were performed using vendor software and laboratory-developed analysis workflows. TST generated \u2265500\u00d7 coverage for 98.4% of the 13,952 targeted bases. Reproducible and accurate variant calling was achieved at \u22655% variant allele frequency with 8 to 12 multiplexed samples per MiSeq flow cell.

The PENm is modified based on the current EMG-driven models by decreasing the calculation time and ensuring good prediction accuracy. To ensure the calculation efficiency, the PENm is simplified into two EMG channels around one joint with minimal physiological parameters. In addition, a dynamic computation model is developed to achieve real-time calculation. To ensure the calculation accuracy, patient-specific muscle kinematics information, such as the musculotendon lengths and the muscle moment arms during the entire gait cycle, are employed based on the patient-specific musculoskeletal model. Moreover, an improved force-length-velocity relationship is implemented to generate accurate muscle forces. Gait analysis data including kinematics, ground reaction forces, and raw EMG signals from six adolescents at three different speeds were used to evaluate the PENm. The simulation results show that the PENm has the potential to predict accurate joint moment in real-time. The design of advanced human-robot interaction control strategies and human-inspired gait rehabilitation robots can benefit from the application of the human internal state provided by the PENm.",

In group I (n = 10), continuous intracameral positive pressure was maintained for 8 minutes. In group II (n = 10) and group III (n = 10), external corneal massage was initiated simultaneously with positive intracameral air pressure. The external corneal massage was continued till complete resolution of interface fluid; the positive intracameral pressure was maintained for 8 minutes in group II and for 5 minutes in group III. The host-donor relationship was continuously monitored with the iOCT. The main outcome measure was time to complete donor lenticule apposition.\nRESULTS: In group I, the interface fluid persisted after 8 minutes of positive intracameral pressure in all eyes (10/10); hence an external corneal massage was required to achieve optimal donor adherence. In groups II and III, all eyes (20/20) had complete resolution of the interface fluid at the end of 3 minutes. In 100% of the eyes (30/30), the grafts were attached after anterior chamber decompression as seen on the iOCT. In all cases, the donor lenticules were adhered in the postoperative period.\nCONCLUSIONS: iOCT helps in understanding that the donor lenticule is well apposed within 1 to 3 minutes with the technique of simultaneous positive intracameral pressure and external corneal massage. This knowledge minimizes the waiting time for graft apposition and prevents prolonged intraocular pressure elevation.",

Therefore, three lab-scale composting reactors, A (the control), B (natural zeolite addition) and C (nitrification inhibitor addition of 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate, DMPP), were established. The impacts of natural zeolite and DMPP on the levels of ARGs were investigated, as were the roles that heavy metals, mobile genetic elements (MGEs) and the bacterial community play in ARGs evolution. The results showed that total ARGs copies were enriched 2.04 and 1.95 times in reactors A and C, respectively, but were reduced by 1.5% in reactor B due to the reduction of conjugation and co-selection of heavy metals caused by natural zeolite. Although some ARGs (blaCTX-M, blaTEM, ermB, ereA and tetW) were reduced by 0.3-2 logs, others (ermF, sulI, sulII, tetG, tetX, mefA and aac(6')-Ib-cr) increased by 0.3-1.3 logs after sludge composting. Although the contributors for the ARGs profiles in different stages were quite different, the results of a partial redundancy analysis, Mantel test and Procrustes analysis showed that the bacterial community was the main contributor to the changes in ARGs compared to MGEs and heavy metals. Network analysis determined the potential host bacteria for various ARGs and further confirmed our results.",

Identification of these patients are critical as they are at substantially increased risk of developing multiple primary tumors, mainly colorectal and endometrial cancer (EC), occurring at a young age. This demonstrates the need to develop new and/or more thorough mutation detection approaches. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) was used to screen 22 genes involved in the DNA MMR pathway in constitutional DNA from 14 HNPCC and 12 sporadic EC patients, plus 2 positive controls. Several softwares were used for analysis and functional annotation. We identified 5 exonic indel variants, 42 exonic nonsynonymous single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and 1 intronic variant of significance. Three of these variants were class 5 (pathogenic) or class 4 (likely pathogenic), 5 were class 3 (uncertain clinical relevance) and 40 were classified as variants of unknown clinical significance. In conclusion, we have identified two LS families from the sporadic EC patients, one without a family history of cancer, supporting the notion for universal MMR screening of EC patients. In addition, we have detected three novel class 3 variants in EC cases. We have, in addition discovered a polygenic interaction which is the most likely cause of cancer development in a HNPCC patient that could explain previous inconsistent results reported on an intronic EXO1 variant.",

Sexual fruiting bodies of the ascomycete fungus Cordyceps militaris have been widely consumed as edible and medicinal mushrooms, whereas the regulation of fruiting-body development and sex in this fungus remain elusive. Herein, we performed the comprehensive functional analyses of mating-type (MAT) genes in C. militaris. Interspecies functional convergence was evident that MAT1-1 and MAT1-2-1 null mutants were sterile and lost the ability to produce stromata in outcrosses with the opposite mating-type partner. In contrast to other fungal species, functional divergence of MAT1-1-1 and MAT1-1-2 was also observed that \u0394MAT1-1-1 produced barren stromata in outcrosses, whereas \u0394MAT1-1-2 generated fruiting bodies morphologically similar to that of the parental strain but with sterile perithecia. The homothallic-like transformants MAT1-2::MAT1-1-1 (haploidic MAT1-2 isolate transformed with the MAT1-1-1 gene) produced sterile stromata, whereas the MAT1-1::MAT1-2-1 (haploidic MAT1-1 isolate transformed with the MAT1-2-1 gene) mutant was determined to be completely fruitless. The findings relating to the fully fertile gene-complementation mutants suggest that the genomic location is not essential for the MAT genes to fulfill their functions in C. militaris. Comparison of the production of bioactive constituents cordycepin and adenosine provides experimental support that the fungal sexual cycle is an energy consuming process.

Research suggests that 'wanting' as opposed to 'liking' is related to dopaminergic processes. Therefore, it was hypothesized that risk allele carriers of the Taq1A polymorphism exhibit late ERP changes in reaction to words representing incentive motivation, i.e. 'wanting' (word categories 'lust' and 'anticipation'), but not to words representing 'liking' ('closeness').\nMETHODS: Seventy-two male participants performed an emotional-word Stroop task during EEG recording and were genotyped according to the Taq1A polymorphism of ANKK1/DRD2.\nRESULTS: Positive emotional words related to anticipation and lust revealed blunted responses in the late positive potential (LPP) in carriers of the A1 allele, an effect absent in response to 'liking'-related words. These differences were not evident in the earlier posterior negativity (EPN).\nCONCLUSION: As no differences in dependence of the Taq1A genotype were observed in reaction to 'wanting'- and 'liking'-related words in the EPN, but merely in the LPP, it can be assumed that incentive-motivational stimuli only modify motivation-related ERP responses in carriers of the A1 allele of the Taq1A polymorphism, indicating the role of dopamine in late ERP components.",

Patient-derived iPSCs, however, would still harbor disease-causing mutations. To generate healthy patient-derived cells, mutations might be repaired with new gene-editing technology based on the bacterial system of clustered regularly interspersed short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9, thereby yielding grafts that require no patient immunosuppression. We tested whether CRISPR/Cas9 could be used in patient-specific iPSCs to precisely repair an RPGR point mutation that causes X-linked retinitis pigmentosa (XLRP). Fibroblasts cultured from a skin-punch biopsy of an XLRP patient were transduced to produce iPSCs carrying the patient's c.3070G\u2009>\u2009T mutation. The iPSCs were transduced with CRISPR guide RNAs, Cas9 endonuclease, and a donor homology template. Despite the gene's repetitive and GC-rich sequences, 13% of RPGR gene copies showed mutation correction and conversion to the wild-type allele. This is the first report using CRISPR to correct a pathogenic mutation in iPSCs derived from a patient with photoreceptor degeneration. This important proof-of-concept finding supports the development of personalized iPSC-based transplantation therapies for retinal disease.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Several non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) methods, which analyze circulating fetal cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in maternal plasma, suggest a fetal fraction (FF) \u2265 4% for a reportable result, with the assumption that fetal aneuploidies may not be detectable at lower FF. This study determined the actual limit of detection (LOD) of a massively parallel sequencing-based NIPT method and evaluated its performance in testing samples with low FF.\nMETHOD: An experimental model, involving the creation of artificial plasma mixtures with a final aneuploid FF ranging from 1% to 4%, simulated samples at different proportions of fetal cfDNA. We then analyzed 7103 blood samples, from pregnant women undergoing NIPT, to assess the impact of low FF on the performance of cfDNA testing.\nRESULTS: Detection of common aneuploidies in samples with an FF as low as 2% is well within the ability of this technology. Of 105 pregnancies confirmed chromosomally abnormal, 25 (23.8%) involving a 2%\u2009< \u2009FF \u2009<\u2009 4% were consistently detected. These high-risk pregnancies would have not been identified using the suggested 4% FF cut-off.\nCONCLUSION: This study underscores the importance of determining the actual LOD for each specific NIPT methodology. It may reduce the incidence of test cancelations and shorten the time required for the diagnosis of aneuploidy. \u00a9 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

All studies were evaluated using the ORION guidance.\nRESULTS: Thirty studies were identified including 17 102 infants of whom 664 (3.9%) became infected. No single intervention was identified that reduced duration or mortality. Studies that introduced multiple interventions had significantly reduced case fatality ratio and outbreak duration compared to those that used basic surveillance only. Low and low-middle income countries reported the fewest interventions to control outbreaks and these studies were also associated with higher mortality than that found in middle and high income countries.\nCONCLUSIONS: Systematic reporting and formal evaluation of interventions used to reduce healthcare-associated neonatal infection outbreaks is key to identifying containment strategies worldwide.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Many studies over the past decade have together identified genes that are recurrently mutated in the myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). We will summarize how this information has informed our understanding of disease pathogenesis and behavior, with an emphasis on how this information may inform therapeutic strategies.\nRECENT FINDINGS: Genomic sequencing techniques have allowed for the identification of many recurrently mutated genes in MDS, with the most common mutations being found in epigenetic modifiers and components of the splicing machinery. Although many mutations are associated with clinical outcomes and disease phenotypes, at the current time they add relatively little to already robust clinical prognostic algorithms. However, as molecular genetic data are accumulated in larger numbers of patients, it is likely that the clinical significance of co-occurring mutations and less common mutations will come to light. Finally, mutated genes may identify biologically distinct subgroups of MDS that may benefit from novel therapies, and a subset of these genes may themselves serve as therapeutic targets.\nSUMMARY: Advances in our knowledge of the molecular genetics of MDS have significantly improved our understanding of disease biology and promise to improve tools for clinical decision-making and identify new therapies for patients.",

Although current therapeutic strategies provide a reasonable likelihood of achieving a complete remission for the majority of patients, relapse rates and subsequent disease-related mortality remain unacceptably high. Improved methods of risk stratification are needed to better identify patients at considerable risk of relapse in hopes of allowing for early therapeutic intervention and/or intensification that may lead to a higher likelihood of cure. The current status of risk stratification of AML and emerging technologies with potential to improve prognostic classification and outcomes are summarized in this review.\nRECENT FINDINGS: Refinement of our understanding of the impact of current pretreatment AML cytogenetic, immunophenotypic, and molecular aberrations to predict outcomes and guide therapeutic decision-making is ongoing. Emerging data suggest that incorporation of the degree of posttreatment response and/or the detection of minimal residual disease can improve the accuracy of risk stratification for individual patients.\nSUMMARY: Although pretreatment disease characteristics remain the hallmark of prognostication for AML patients, posttreatment parameters such as minimal residual disease assessment and degree of response to therapy possess the ability to further refine our identification of patients with unfavorable disease and thereby influence decisions regarding therapeutic planning.",

Out of the 89 patients, 15(16.8%) were diagnosed with small bowel tumor. A novel set of textural features that integrate multi-scale curvelet and fractal technology were proposed to distinguish normal images from tumor images. The second order textural descriptors as well as higher order moments between different color channels were computed from images synthesized by the inverse curvelet transform of the selected scales. Then, a classification approach based on support vector machine (SVM) and genetic algorithm (GA) was further employed to select the optimal feature set and classify the real small bowel images.

The current recommended in-hospital treatment is parenteral ampicillin (or penicillin) and gentamicin in young infants for 10- 14 days; however, very few could access and afford. The current review is to evaluate the feasibility of gentamicin in community based settings.\nMETHODS: Both observational and randomized controlled trials were included. Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Central Trial Register of India were searched until September 2013. We assessed the risk of bias by Cochrane Collaboration's \"risk of bias\" tool.\nRESULTS: Two observational studies indicated feasibility ensuring coverage of population, decrease in case fatality rate in the group treated by community health workers. In an RCT, no significant difference was observed in the treatment failure rates [odds ratio (OR)=0.88], and the mortality in the first and second week (OR=1.53; OR=2.24) between gentamicin and ceftriaxone groups. Within the gentamicin group, the combination of penicillin and gentamicin showed a lower rate of treatment failure (OR=0.44) and mortality at second week of life (OR=0.17) as compared to the combination of gentamicin and oral cotrimoxazole.\nCONCLUSION: Gentamicin for the treatment of neonatal sepsis is both feasible and effective in community-based settings and can be used as an alternative to the hospitalbased care in resource compromised settings. But there was less evidence in the management of neonatal sepsis in hospitals as was seen in this review in which we included only one RCT and three observational studies.",

        "abstract": "Amber suppression is a useful method of genetically incorporating a non-natural amino acid (NAA) into a protein during translation by utilizing an NAA-charged amber suppressor tRNA (sup-tRNA). A wheat germ extract (WGE) is suitable for this method by virtue of its high productivity and versatility in addition to its advantages as a cell-free translation system. However, in spite of this high potential, a genetic NAA incorporation system in WGE has not been sufficiently optimized in terms of sup-tRNAs, in contrast to that in E. coli and its cell extracts. We herein rationally optimized amber sup-tRNAs to efficiently incorporate a model NAA, p-acetyl-phenylalanine (AcPhe), into a protein in WGE, via flexizyme-based aminoacylation. The optimized sup-tRNA (named tLys-opt) that was pre-charged with AcPhe exclusively yielded up to 220 \u03bcg mL(-1) of AcPhe-incorporated protein (yellow fluorescent protein, YPet) under the optimal conditions. This high productivity is comparable to the best reported yield of a similar NAA-incorporated protein synthesized with an engineered aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase/sup-tRNA pair in WGE, despite the fact that tLys-opt that has released AcPhe was not reused at all in this study. The results clearly show both the necessity of optimizing sup-tRNAs for efficient NAA incorporation and the validity of our strategy for their optimization. Because the optimization strategy described here is expected to be applicable not only to amber sup-tRNAs for other NAAs but also to ones used in other acylation methods, it would facilitate the synthesis of large amounts of various types of NAA-incorporated proteins in WGE.",

In this report, bacteria from two cold and alkaline environments, the ikaite columns in Greenland and alkaline ponds in the McMurdo Dry Valley region, Antarctica, were screened for extracellular protease activity. Two isolates, Arsukibacterium ikkense from Greenland and a related strain, Arsukibacterium sp. MJ3, from Antarctica, were further characterized with respect to protease production. Genome sequencing identified a range of potential extracellular proteases including a number of putative secreted subtilisins. An extensive liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis of proteins secreted by A. ikkense identified six subtilisin-like proteases as abundant components of the exoproteome in addition to other peptidases potentially involved in complete degradation of extracellular protein. Screening of Arsukibacterium genome libraries in Escherichia coli identified two orthologous secreted subtilisins active at pH 10 and 20 \u00b0C, which were also present in the A. ikkense exoproteome.

        "abstract": "Psoriasis is a prevalent chronic inflammatory disease whose exact aetiology is not fully understood, but both genetic and environmental factors have been implicated in the onset and progression of the disease. At the skin level, psoriasis is characterized by localized or widespread thick raised silvery-white scaling and pruritic plaques and studies have shown that psoriasis negatively affects patients' quality of life, and depression occurs more often in patients with psoriasis. However, data have shown that psoriasis is a systemic disease which affects the joints, vasculature, and other tissues as well. Indeed, approximately one-third of patients with psoriasis develop psoriatic arthritis, and patients with severe psoriasis have a shortened life expectancy. Although our knowledge of the pathogenesis of psoriasis has advanced significantly in the past decade, as have the pharmacological treatment options which are now available, several important knowledge gaps remain. Many of the proinflammatory mediators involved in psoriasis have also been implicated in some central nervous system (CNS) diseases. However, studies on associations between psoriasis and CNS diseases are scarce. Based on nationwide registry data from the entire Danish population, the present thesis examined the associations between psoriasis and certain CNS diseases. The specific objectives of this work were to investigate the independent impact of depression on the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in patients with psoriasis, the relationship between psoriasis and uveitis, and the risk of incident multiple sclerosis (MS) following the onset of psoriasis, respectively. The main results were a significantly increased risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and CVD death in patients with psoriasis during stages of acute depression. Moreover, we found a bidirectional relationship between psoriasis and uveitis, where the occurrence of either disease significantly increased the risk of the other. Perhaps most notably, however, was that we found a psoriasis-severity dependent increased risk of MS. In conclusion, psoriasis was significantly associated with certain CNS diseases, and the risk of CVD was strongly associated with acute depression in these patients. These novel findings suggest an important link between psoriasis and CNS diseases, and high-light the necessity for a holistic approach to the diagnosis and treatment of patients with psoriasis.",

Median age was 45 years. Stage at presentation: Stage I (9%), stage II (59%), and stage III (32%). Infiltrating ductal carcinoma (92%) constituted the most prevalent histological subtype. Estrogen (ER), progesterone (PR) and Her2-neu were positive in 49%, 50%, and 26%, respectively. A mastectomy was performed in 67% and conservative surgery in 33% of the patients. Post-operative radiotherapy was delivered in 85% of the cases. Ninety percent of the patients received chemotherapy and mainly consisted of anthracycline-based regimens + taxanes. Hormonal manipulation was done in ER/PR positive patients.\nRESULTS: The 5- and 10-year overall survival (OS) was 70% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 68.2-71.8%) and 54% (95%CI: 51.2-56.8%), while disease free survival (DFS) was 65% (95% CI: 63-67%) and 52% (95% CI: 49.2-54.8%), respectively. Recurrence following primary treatment was seen in 35% of the patients. On multivariate analysis T stage, number of axillary nodal involvement, tumor grade, ER status and family history, were found to be independent predictors for OS and DFS.\nCONCLUSIONS: Over 90% of non-metastatic breast cancer patients present with stagesII and III disease and a significant proportion develop distant metastasis accounting for overall long-term outcome inferior to developed countries. Efforts should be directed to raise the level of health awareness and screening programs to improve early detection in Pakistan.",

        "abstract": "Multiple myeloma (MM) cells are characterized by genomic alternations that lead to increased cell proliferation and resistance to therapeutic interventions. Up-regulation of cyclins is a characteristic finding in a significant proportion of myeloma patients, mediated through a variety of mechanisms including chromosomal translocations. Cyclins and the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) play a critical role in the cell proliferation seen in MM, especially in the high-risk disease. Given this, CDK inhibitors have been evaluated in this disease, and studies so far have led to a mixed picture. Recent studies with targeted CDK inhibitors have shown early promise, and trials of these drugs in combination with other myeloma drugs are ongoing. The malignant plasma cells in MM are highly dependent on the microenvironment for their growth and survival. Multiple signaling pathways have been found to mediate the interactions between the microenvironment and the plasma cells, whether mediated through cytokines or adhesion molecules. The PIM kinase pathway appears to play a major role in the myeloma cell survival, and PIM kinase inhibitors have shown efficacy in the laboratory, and a recent clinical trial also demonstrates important clinical activity.",

At second trimester, women completed a full 75 g oral glucose tolerance test and we collected additional blood samples. At delivery, we collected cord blood and placenta samples; obstetrical and neonatal clinical data were abstracted from electronic medical records. We also collected buffy coats and extracted DNA from maternal and/or offspring samples (placenta and blood cells) to pursue genetic and epigenetic hypotheses. So far, we have found that low adiponectin and low vitamin D maternal levels in first trimester predict higher risk of developing gestational diabetes.\nFUTURE PLANS: We are now in the phase of prospective follow-up of mothers and offspring 3 and 5 years postdelivery to investigate the consequences of maternal dysglycaemia during pregnancy on offspring adiposity and metabolic profile.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT01623934.",

        "abstract": "Circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is a valuable source of tumor material available with a simple blood sampling enabling a noninvasive quantitative and qualitative analysis of the tumor genome. cfDNA is released by tumor cells and exhibits the genetic and epigenetic alterations of the tumor of origin. Circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) analysis constitutes a hopeful approach to provide a noninvasive tumor molecular test for cancer patients. Based upon basic research on the origin and structure of cfDNA, new information on circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) structure, and specific determination of cfDNA fragmentation and size, we revisited Q-PCR-based method and recently developed a the allele-specific-Q-PCR-based method with blocker (termed as Intplex) which is the first multiplexed test for cfDNA. This technique, named Intplex(\u00ae) and based on a refined Q-PCR method, derived from critical observations made on the specific structure and size of cfDNA. It enables the simultaneous determination of five parameters: the cfDNA total concentration, the presence of a previously known point mutation, the mutant (tumor) cfDNA concentration (ctDNA), the proportion of mutant cfDNA, and the cfDNA fragmentation index. Intplex(\u00ae) has enabled the first clinical validation of ctDNA analysis in oncology by detecting KRAS and BRAF point mutations in mCRC patients and has demonstrated that a blood test could replace tumor section analysis for the detection of KRAS and BRAF mutations. The Intplex(\u00ae) test can be adapted to all mutations, genes, or cancers and enables rapid, highly sensitive, cost-effective, and repetitive analysis. As regards to the determination of mutations on cfDNA Intplex(\u00ae) is limited to the mutational status of known hotspot mutation; it is a \"targeted approach.\" However, it offers the opportunity in detecting quantitatively and dynamically mutation and could constitute a noninvasive attractive tool potentially allowing diagnosis, prognosis, theranostics, therapeutic monitoring, and follow-up of cancer patients expanding the scope of personalized cancer medicine.",

        "abstract": "Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is the causative agent of infectious mononucleosis and is associated with posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD), Hodgkin's lymphoma, Burkitt's lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and HIV-related lymphomas. It infects nearly all humans and then persists for the life of the host in a small proportion of benign B lymphocytes. EBV reactivation, usually in the setting of immunosuppression, is the main risk factor for development of EBV-associated malignancies. EBV reactivation can be detected in tissue specimens using EBV-encoded RNA (EBER) in situ hybridization (ISH), which is routinely used for diagnosis of PTLD and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. However, EBER ISH cannot be routinely used for screening asymptomatic or monitoring posttreatment outcome due to difficulty in obtaining tissue specimens for testing and the nonquantitative nature of the assay. Recent studies have shown that EBV genomic DNA can be detected in blood of patients with EBV-associated diseases, and that monitoring of EBV viral load in blood could be an effective method of distinguishing disease-associated EBV reactivation from incidental EBV present in benign B lymphocytes, and could be used for diagnostic screening and monitoring of EBV-associated diseases.

Characterizing this barrier is the ability to prevent some chemicals from crossing the barrier while allowing others, including medicinal products, to pass at varying rates. During recent decades, the latter has received increased attention as a route for intentionally delivering drugs to patients. This has stimulated research in methods for sampling, measuring and predicting percutaneous penetration. Previous chapters have described how different endogenous, genetic and exogenous factors may affect barrier characteristics. The present chapter introduces the theory for barrier penetration (Fick's law), and describes and discusses different methods for measuring the kinetics of percutaneous penetration of chemicals, including in vitro methods (static and flow-through diffusion cells) as well as in vivo methods (microdialysis and microperfusion). Then follows a discussion with examples of how different characteristics of the skin (age, site and integrity) and of the penetrants (size, solubility, ionization, logPow and vehicles) affect the kinetics of percutaneous penetration. Finally, a short discussion of the advantages and challenges of each method is provided, which will hopefully allow the reader to improve decision making and treatment planning, as well as the evaluation of experimental studies of percutaneous penetration of chemicals.",

We aimed to determine whether small, increasing cash payments, which were conditional on attendance at scheduled clinic visits and receipt of proposed services can increase the proportions of HIV-infected pregnant women who accept available PMTCT services and remain in care.\nMETHODS: In this randomised controlled trial, we recruited newly diagnosed HIV-infected women, who were 32 or less weeks pregnant, from 89 antenatal care clinics in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo, and randomly assigned (1:1) them to either the intervention group or the control group using computer-based randomisation with varying block sizes of four, six, and eight. The intervention group received compensation on the condition that they attended scheduled clinic visits and accepted offered PMTCT services (US$5, plus US$1 increment at every subsequent visit), whereas the control group received usual care. Outcomes assessed included retention in care at 6 weeks' post partum and uptake of PMTCT services, measured by attendance of all scheduled clinic visits and acceptance of proposed services up to 6 weeks' post partum. Analyses were by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.org, number NCT01838005.\nFINDINGS: Between April 18, 2013, and Aug 30, 2014, 612 potential participants were identified, 545 were screened, and 433 were enrolled and randomly assigned; 217 to the control group and 216 to the intervention group. At 6 weeks' post partum, 174 participants in the intervention group (81%) and 157 in the control group (72%) were retained in care (risk ratio [RR] 1\u00b711; 95% CI 1\u00b700-1\u00b724). 146 participants in the intervention group (68%) and 116 in the control group (54%) attended all clinic visits and accepted proposed services (RR 1\u00b726; 95% CI 1\u00b708-1\u00b748). Results were similar after adjustment for marital status, age, and education.\nINTERPRETATION: Among women with newly diagnosed HIV, small, incremental cash incentives resulted in increased retention along the PMTCT cascade and uptake of available services. The cost-effectiveness of these incentives and their effect on HIV-free survival warrant further investigation.\nFUNDING: President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief and the National Institute of Health and Child Development.",

        "abstract": "Many studies regarding the effects of drugs investigate the acute and chronic use of alcohol, but only a few address the effects of caffeine and alcohol combined to the performance of the zebrafish in cognitive tasks. The zebrafish is an important model for studying the effects of drugs on learning, because it has large genetic similarities to humans and the non-invasive administration of the substances favors translational bias of research. In this study, we observed the effects of alcohol and caffeine on zebrafish cognition through an object discrimination test. We noticed that animals subjected to acute alcohol dose and those under alcohol or caffeine withdrawal did not show discrimination. When fish were treated with associated alcohol and caffeine, those chronically treated with alcohol and subjected to moderate acute dose of caffeine showed learning of the task. Our results reinforce the harmful effects of the alcohol use on cognitive tasks, and suggest that continued use of high doses of caffeine cause cognitive impairment during withdrawal of the substance. However, the acute use of caffeine appears to reverse the harmful effects of alcohol withdrawal, allowing discriminative performance equivalent to control fish. Finally, we reiterate the use of zebrafish as a model for drug effects screening and search for active compounds that modulate the alcohol and caffeine effects.",

Genetic association studies have evolved substantially in recent years, moving away from the traditional candidate gene analyses to newer approaches utilizing sophisticated analysis platforms to examine sequencing data, and shifting towards functional studies including methylation analysis. It is becoming increasingly evident that careful clinical phenotyping is crucial to high quality genetic association studies regardless of the assay or platform being used. Nonetheless, genetic studies of prematurity are hampered by numerous challenges including small sample sizes, incomplete phenotying, population stratification, and multiple comparisons. As the costs of sequencing and functional analyses continue to decrease, unbiased genome-wide assays will be more widely available. Researchers have met improved success recently when critically applying clinical phenotyping knowledge to group women prior to analyzing genotyping results. Eventually, as the analytic approaches evolve, it is likely that this methodology (combining precisely clinically phenotyped subjects with genome-wide data) will provide key information regarding the pathophysiology of prematurity, and provide potential new avenues for exploring innovative therapeutic strategies.",

Although PGC migration is crucial for a genetic continuation to the next generation, the factors and mechanisms that control their migration remain largely unknown. In the present study the chemotactic effect of stem cell factor (SCF) was examined on chicken blood circulating PGCs (cPGC), employing 3D chemotaxis slides and time-lapsed imaging analyses as an in vitro study model. Upon in vitro exposure to an SCF gradient, 77.1% (54 out of 70) of cPGCs showed a clear response, of which 48.1% (26 out of 54) polarized with the consecutive formation of a persistent membrane protrusion and significant directional migration towards the gradient and the others showed transient membrane protrusions. In contrast, the controls and apparently SCF unresponsive cPGCs and c-kit-negative red blood cells (RBCs) showed only cytoplasmic cycling with random formations of membrane blebbing and no directional migration. Significant (p < 0.05) differences between the SCF-treated and control cPGCs and RBCs were found in the migration parameters of eccentricity, accumulated and Euclidean distances, and migration velocity. The SCF-treated PGCs also revealed a chemotactic response, as judged by their significant displacement of center of mass and Rayleigh test. Complete inhibition of all the SCF-induced responses in PGCs was found following pretreatment of the cPGCs with 10 \u00b5M of the c-kit inhibitor, STI57l, prior to SCF exposure. In addition, cPGCs were found to be positive for c-kit expression using a polyclonal goat anti-mouse c-kit primary antibody, suggesting that the cPGCs were capable of SCF sensing and the potential involvement of SCF/c-kit in the chemotactic migration. Therefore, SCF is suggested to function as a chemoattractant in the migration of chicken cPGC.",

        "abstract": "Three sets of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers were designed for heminested PCR amplification of the target DNA fragments in the human genome which include the site of BRCA1 c.68_69del, BRCA1 c.5266dup and BRCA2 c.5946del respectively, to prepare the templates for direct Sanger sequencing screen of these three founder mutations. With a robust PCR mixture, crude proteinase K digestate of the fixed cervicovaginal cells in the liquid-based Papanicolaou (Pap) cytology specimens can be used as the sample for target DNA amplification without pre-PCR DNA extraction, purification and quantitation. The post-PCR products can be used directly as the sequencing templates without further purification or quantitation. By simplifying the frontend procedures for template preparation, the cost for screening these three founder mutations can be reduced to about US $200 per test when performed in conjunction with human papillomavirus (HPV) assays now routinely ordered for cervical cancer prevention. With this projected price structure, selective patients in a high-risk population can be tested and each provided with a set of DNA sequencing electropherograms to document the absence or presence of these founder mutations in her genome to help assess inherited susceptibility to breast and ovarian cancer in this era of precision molecular personalized medicine.",

        "abstract": "Heavy-metal soil contamination is one of the major abiotic stress factors that, by negatively affecting plant growth and development, severely limit agricultural productivity worldwide. Plants have evolved various tolerance and detoxification strategies in order to cope with heavy-metal toxicity while ensuring adequate supply of essential micronutrients at the whole-plant as well as cellular levels. Genetic studies in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana have been instrumental in elucidating such mechanisms. The root assay constitutes a very powerful and simple method to assess heavy-metal stress tolerance in Arabidopsis seedlings. It allows the simultaneous determination of all the standard growth parameters affected by heavy-metal stress (primary root elongation, lateral root development, shoot biomass, and chlorophyll content) in a single experiment. Additionally, this protocol emphasizes the tips and tricks that become particularly useful when quantifying subtle alterations in tolerance to a given heavy-metal stress, when simultaneously pursuing a large number of plant lines, or when testing sensitivity to a wide range of heavy metals for a single line.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The medical literature lacks a comprehensive taxonomy of decisions made by physicians in medical encounters. Such a taxonomy might be useful in understanding the physician-centred, patient-centred and shared decision-making in clinical settings. We aimed to identify and classify all decisions emerging in conversations between patients and physicians.\nDESIGN: Qualitative study of video recorded patient-physician encounters.\nPARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: 380 patients in consultations with 59 physicians from 17 clinical specialties and three different settings (emergency room, ward round, outpatient clinic) in a Norwegian teaching hospital. A randomised sample of 30 encounters from internal medicine was used to identify and classify decisions, a maximum variation sample of 20 encounters was used for reliability assessments, and the remaining encounters were analysed to test for applicability across specialties.\nRESULTS: On the basis of physician statements in our material, we developed a taxonomy of clinical decisions--the Decision Identification and Classification Taxonomy for Use in Medicine (DICTUM). We categorised decisions into 10 mutually exclusive categories: gathering additional information, evaluating test results, defining problem, drug-related, therapeutic procedure-related, legal and insurance-related, contact-related, advice and precaution, treatment goal, and deferment. Four-coder inter-rater reliability using Krippendorff's \u03b1 was 0.79.\nCONCLUSIONS: DICTUM represents a precise, detailed and comprehensive taxonomy of medical decisions communicated within patient-physician encounters. Compared to previous normative frameworks, the taxonomy is descriptive, substantially broader and offers new categories to the variety of clinical decisions. The taxonomy could prove helpful in studies on the quality of medical work, use of time and resources, and understanding of why, when and how patients are or are not involved in decisions.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Environmental enteropathy (EE) is a subclinical enteric condition found in low-income countries that is characterized by intestinal inflammation, reduced intestinal absorption, and gut barrier dysfunction. We aimed to assess if EE impairs the success of oral polio and rotavirus vaccines in infants in Bangladesh.\nMETHODS: We conducted a prospective observational study of 700 infants from an urban slum of Dhaka, Bangladesh from May 2011 to November 2014. Infants were enrolled in the first week of life and followed to age one year through biweekly home visits with EPI vaccines administered and growth monitored. EE was operationally defied as enteric inflammation measured by any one of the fecal biomarkers reg1B, alpha-1-antitrypsin, MPO, calprotectin, or neopterin. Oral polio vaccine success was evaluated by immunogenicity, and rotavirus vaccine response was evaluated by immunogenicity and protection from disease. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01375647.\nFINDINGS: EE was present in greater than 80% of infants by 12 weeks of age. Oral poliovirus and rotavirus vaccines failed in 20.2% and 68.5% of the infants respectively, and 28.6% were malnourished (HAZ < - 2) at one year of age. In contrast, 0%, 9.0%, 7.9% and 3.8% of infants lacked protective levels of antibody from tetanus, Haemophilus influenzae type b, diphtheria and measles vaccines respectively. EE was negatively associated with oral polio and rotavirus response but not parenteral vaccine immunogenicity. Biomarkers of systemic inflammation and measures of maternal health were additionally predictive of both oral vaccine failure and malnutrition. The selected biomarkers from multivariable analysis accounted for 46.3% variation in delta HAZ. 24% of Rotarix\u00ae IgA positive individuals can be attributed to the selected biomarkers.\nINTERPRETATION: EE as well as systemic inflammation and poor maternal health were associated with oral but not parenteral vaccine underperformance and risk for future growth faltering. These results offer a potential explanation for the burden of these problems in low-income problems, allow early identification of infants at risk, and suggest pathways for intervention.\nFUNDING: The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (OPP1017093).",

        "abstract": "The flux of methane (CH4 ) from inland waters to the atmosphere has a profound impact on global atmospheric greenhouse gas (GHG) levels, and yet, strikingly little is known about the dynamics controlling sources and sinks of CH4 in the aquatic setting. Here, we examine the cycling and flux of CH4 in six large rivers in the Amazon basin, including the Amazon River. Based on stable isotopic mass balances of CH4 , inputs and outputs to the water column were estimated. We determined that ecosystem methane oxidation (MOX) reduced the diffusive flux of CH4 by approximately 28-96% and varied depending on hydrologic regime and general geochemical characteristics of tributaries of the Amazon River. For example, the relative amount of MOX was maximal during high water in black and white water rivers and minimal in clear water rivers during low water. The abundance of genetic markers for methane-oxidizing bacteria (pmoA) was positively correlated with enhanced signals of oxidation, providing independent support for the detected MOX patterns. The results indicate that MOX in large Amazonian rivers can consume from 0.45 to 2.07 Tg CH4 yr(-1) , representing up to 7% of the estimated global soil sink. Nevertheless, climate change and changes in hydrology, for example, due to construction of dams, can alter this balance, influencing CH4 emissions to atmosphere.",

Clinical translation of MSC-based approaches requires in vitro culture-expansion to achieve a sufficient number of cells. The ideal cell culture medium should be devoid of any animal derived components. We have evaluated whether human Platelet Lysate (hPL) could be an attractive alternative to animal supplements.\nMETHODS: MSCs from bone marrow (BMSCs) and adipose tissue-derived stromal cells (ASCs) obtained from three donors were culture expanded in three different commercially available hPL fulfilling good manufacturing practice criteria for clinical use. BMSCs and ASCs cultured in Minimum Essential Medium Eagle-alpha supplemented with 5% PLT-Max (Mill Creek), Stemulate\u2122 PL-S and Stemulate\u2122 PL-SP (COOK General Biotechnology) were compared to standard culture conditions with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Cell morphology, proliferation, phenotype, genomic stability, and differentiation potential were analyzed.\nRESULTS: Regardless of manufacturer, BMSCs and ASCs cultured in hPL media showed a significant increase in proliferation capacity compared to FBS medium. In general, the immunophenotype of both BMSCs and ASCs fulfilled International Society for Cellular Therapy (ISCT) criteria after hPL media expansion. Comparative genomic hybridization measurements demonstrated no unbalanced chromosomal rearrangements for BMSCs or ASCs cultured in hPL media or FBS medium. The BMSCs and ASCs could differentiate into osteogenic, adipogenic, or chondrogenic lineages in all four culture conditions.\nCONCLUSION: All three clinically approved commercial human platelet lysates accelerated proliferation of BMSCs and ASCs and the cells meet the ISCT mesenchymal phenotypic requirements without exhibiting chromosomal aberrations.",

        "abstract": "Optimization of root system architecture (RSA) traits is an important objective for modern wheat breeding. Linkage and association mapping for RSA in two recombinant inbred line populations and one association mapping panel of 183 elite durum wheat (Triticum turgidum L. var. durum Desf.) accessions evaluated as seedlings grown on filter paper/polycarbonate screening plates revealed 20 clusters of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for root length and number, as well as 30 QTLs for root growth angle (RGA). Divergent RGA phenotypes observed by seminal root screening were validated by root phenotyping of field-grown adult plants. QTLs were mapped on a high-density tetraploid consensus map based on transcript-associated Illumina 90K single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) developed for bread and durum wheat, thus allowing for an accurate cross-referencing of RSA QTLs between durum and bread wheat. Among the main QTL clusters for root length and number highlighted in this study, 15 overlapped with QTLs for multiple RSA traits reported in bread wheat, while out of 30 QTLs for RGA, only six showed co-location with previously reported QTLs in wheat. Based on their relative additive effects/significance, allelic distribution in the association mapping panel, and co-location with QTLs for grain weight and grain yield, the RSA QTLs have been prioritized in terms of breeding value. Three major QTL clusters for root length and number (RSA_QTL_cluster_5#, RSA_QTL_cluster_6#, and RSA_QTL_cluster_12#) and nine RGA QTL clusters (QRGA.ubo-2A.1, QRGA.ubo-2A.3, QRGA.ubo-2B.2/2B.3, QRGA.ubo-4B.4, QRGA.ubo-6A.1, QRGA.ubo-6A.2, QRGA.ubo-7A.1, QRGA.ubo-7A.2, and QRGA.ubo-7B) appear particularly valuable for further characterization towards a possible implementation of breeding applications in marker-assisted selection and/or cloning of the causal genes underlying the QTLs.",

Patient's age, clinical presentation, prostate specific antigen (PSA) level, mode of diagnosis, Gleason sum score, stage of the disease and main modality of treatment were recorded and analyzed.\nRESULTS: There were 278 cases of histologically proven prostate cancer. Mean patient age was 70.5 years. About 50% presented with lower urinary tract symptoms. Only 2% were screening detected cases. Five (2%) patients had a first-degree relative who had prostate cancer. About 81% of patients had a serum PSA above 20 ng/ml. Gleason sum score was 8 or more in 44% of patients. Metastases were found at the time of diagnosis in 60% of patients. Forty-eight patients underwent radical radiotherapy, while seven patients had radical prostatectomy. Most (94%) of the 203 patients who required androgen deprivation therapy had surgical orchiectomy.\nCONCLUSIONS: Sri Lankans appear to be having a low incidence of prostate cancer, but a larger proportion of high-grade cancers in comparison to the UK and USA. Although genetic differences may exist, a dietary or an environmental factor is more likely to be the cause for these changes. The protective effect of this factor appears to wane as South Asians emigrate and live in UK and USA.",

Before they are used in humans, preparations of LV must undergo extensive quality control testing. In particular, testing of LV must demonstrate the absence of replication-competent lentiviruses (RCL) with suitable methods, on representative fractions of vector batches. Current methods based on cell culture are challenging because high titers of vector batches translate into high volumes of cell culture to be tested in RCL assays. As vector batch size and titers are continuously increasing because of the improvement of production and purification methods, it became necessary for us to modify the current RCL assay based on the detection of p24 in cultures of indicator cells. Here, we propose a practical optimization of this method using a pairwise pooling strategy enabling easier testing of higher vector inoculum volumes. These modifications significantly decrease material handling and operator time, leading to a cost-effective method, while maintaining optimal sensibility of the RCL testing.

In this study, bacterial isolates inhabiting polluted sites were screened for tolerance to varying concentrations of mercuric chloride. Following identification, several Pseudomonas and Klebsiella species were found to exhibit the highest tolerance to both organic and inorganic mercury. Screened bacterial isolates were examined for their genetic make-up in terms of the presence of genes (merP and merT) involved in the transport of mercury across the membrane either alone or in combination to deal with the toxic mercury. Gene sequence analysis revealed that the merP gene showed 86-99% homology, while the merT gene showed >98% homology with previously reported sequences.

Despite being the largest state in southeastern Brazil and having the second largest number of inhabitants, there is no information in the State of Minas Gerais regarding the role of HAdV-F in the etiology of ADD. This study was performed to determine the prevalence, to verify the epidemiological aspects of infection, and to characterize the strains of human adenoviruses (HAdV) detected. A total of 377 diarrheal fecal samples were obtained between January 2007 and August 2011 from inpatient and outpatient children of age ranging from 0 to 12 years. All samples were previously tested for rotavirus, norovirus, and astrovirus, and 314 of 377 were negative. The viral DNA was extracted, amplified using the polymerase chain reaction and the HAdV-positive samples were sequenced and phylogenetically analyzed. Statistical analyses were performed using the Chi-square test (p<0.05), considering two conditions: the total of samples tested (377) and the total of negative samples for the remaining viruses tested (314). The overall prevalence of HAdV was 12.47% (47/377); and in 76.60% (36/47) of the positive samples, this virus was the only infectious agent detected. The phylogenetic analysis of partial sequences of 32 positive samples revealed that they all clustered with the HAdV-F type 41. The statistical analysis showed that there was no correlation between the onset of the HAdV infection and the origin of the samples (inpatients or outpatients) in the two conditions tested: the total of samples tested (p=0.598) and the total of negative samples for the remaining viruses tested (p=0.614). There was a significant association in the occurrence of infection in children aged 0-12 months for the condition 1 (p=0.030) as well as condition 2 (p=0.019). The occurrence of infections due to HAdV did not coincide with a pattern of seasonal distribution. These data indicate the significant involvement of HAdV-F type 41 in the etiology of ADD in Minas Gerais, which demonstrates the importance of other viral agents in the development of the disease after the introduction of rotavirus vaccine immunization.",

It results in increased glycolysis uncoupled from mitochondrial respiration, also known as the Warburg effect. Notch signalling is active in contexts where cells undergo glycolytic shift. We decided to test whether metabolic genes are direct transcriptional targets of Notch signalling and whether upregulation of metabolic genes can help Notch to induce tissue growth under physiological conditions and in conditions of Notch-induced hyperplasia. We show that genes mediating cellular metabolic changes towards the Warburg effect are direct transcriptional targets of Notch signalling. They include genes encoding proteins involved in glucose uptake, glycolysis, lactate to pyruvate conversion and repression of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. The direct transcriptional upregulation of metabolic genes is PI3K/Akt independent and occurs not only in cells with overactivated Notch but also in cells with endogenous levels of Notch signalling and in vivo. Even a short pulse of Notch activity is able to elicit long-lasting metabolic changes resembling the Warburg effect. Loss of Notch signalling in Drosophila wing discs as well as in human microvascular cells leads to downregulation of glycolytic genes. Notch-driven tissue overgrowth can be rescued by downregulation of genes for glucose metabolism. Notch activity is able to support growth of wing during nutrient-deprivation conditions, independent of the growth of the rest of the body. Notch is active in situations that involve metabolic reprogramming, and the direct regulation of metabolic genes may be a common mechanism that helps Notch to exert its effects in target tissues.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are increasingly reported worldwide associated with human disease. Defining the significance of NTM in settings with endemic tuberculosis (TB) requires the discrimination of NTM from TB in suspect patients. Correct and timely identification of NTM will impact both therapy and epidemiology of TB and TB-like diseases. The present study aimed at determining the frequency and diversity of NTM among TB suspects in northeastern Tanzania.\nMETHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted between November 2012 through January 2013. Seven hundred and forty-four sputum samples were collected from 372 TB suspects. Detection was done by using phenotypic, GenoType(\u00ae) Mycobacterium CM/AS kits, 16S rRNA and hsp65 gene sequencing for identification of isolates not identified by Hain kits. Binary regression model was used to analyse the predictors of NTM detection.\nRESULTS: The prevalence of NTM was 9.7% of the mycobacterial isolates. Out of 36 patients with confirmed NTM infection, 12 were HIV infected with HIV being a significant predictor of NTM detection (P < 0.001). Co-infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb) was found in five patients. Twenty-eight NTM isolates were identified using GenoType(\u00ae) Mycobacterium CM/AS and eight isolates could not be identified. Identified species included M. gordonae and M. interjectum 6 (16.7%), M. intracelullare 4 (11.1%), M. avium spp. and M. fortuitum 2 (5.5%), M. kansasii, M. lentiflavum, M. simiae, M. celatum, M. marinum 1 (2.8%) each. Of isolates not identified to subspecies level, we identified M. kumamotonense (2), M. intracellulare/kansasii, M. intermedium/triplex, M. acapulcensis/flavescens, M. stomatepiae, M. colombiense and M. terrae complex (1) each using 16S rRNA sequencing. Additionally, hsp65 gene sequencing identified M. kumamotonense, M. scrofulaceum/M. avium, M. avium, M. flavescens/novocastrense, M. kumamotonense/hiberniae, M. lentiflavum, M. colombiense/M. avium and M. kumamotonense/terrae/hiberniae (1) each. Results of the 16S rRNA and hsp65 gene sequencing were concordant in three and discordant in five isolates not identified by GenoType(\u00ae) Mycobacterium CM/AS.\nCONCLUSION: NTM infections may play a vital role in causing lung disease and impact management of TB in endemic settings. GenoType(\u00ae) Mycobacterium CM/AS represents a useful tool to identify clinical NTM infections. However, 16S rRNA gene sequencing should be thought for confirmatory diagnosis of the clinical isolates. Due to the complexity and inconsistence of NTM identification, we recommend diagnosis of NTM infections be centralized by strengthening and setting up quality national and regional infrastructure.",

The sampling duration and standard deviation of aspirated volume were 3 s and 6.8 % respectively. The protein concentration was 1.74 mg/mL. The prototype needle facilitated precise perforation of RWMs and rapid aspiration of cochlear fluid with precise volume control. The needle design is promising and requires testing in human cadaveric temporal bone and further optimization to become clinically viable.",

        "title": "Characterization of Ocular Biomechanics in Pellucid Marginal Degeneration.",
        "abstract": "PURPOSE: This study sought to investigate the diagnostic capacity of corneal biomechanical response parameters in a group of patients with pellucid marginal degeneration (PMD) using the Ocular Response Analyzer (ORA) and Corvis ST devices.\nMETHODS: In this prospective clinical study, we used the Corvis ST and ORA devices to investigate the ocular biomechanics of patients with PMD. Eighty-one eyes were included, and 2 study groups were formed: the PMD group (the study group, n = 29) and the control group (n = 52). We focused on 13 biomechanical parameters. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS. Biomechanical parameters for the 2 groups were compared using analysis of covariance.\nRESULTS: The ORA results demonstrated that the Keratoconus Match Index was significantly lower in the PMD group than in the control group (0.031 \u00b1 0.37 vs. 0.79 \u00b1 0.33; P = 0.001). The 2 groups did not significantly differ with respect to intraocular pressure- and central corneal thickness-adjusted values for corneal hysteresis or corneal resistance factor. Regarding the Corvis parameters, differences between the control and PMD groups were detected for CorWmax amp (control 1.01 \u00b1 0.01, PMD 1.06 \u00b1 0.01; P = 0.020) and CorA2 t (control 21.78 \u00b1 0.03, PMD 21.66 \u00b1 0.04; P = 0.0003).\nCONCLUSIONS: We identified 2 Corvis parameters that could be used to characterize PMD and differentiate PMD corneas from normal corneas. These parameters support the hypothesis that there is significantly less deformation of the central cornea in PMD corneas than in healthy corneas. However, because useful \"first-line\" diagnostic devices for diagnosing PMD (such as Pentacam and the ORA) exist, the Corvis ST serves as an additional diagnostic tool that can also be used for long-term monitoring after diagnosis confirmation.",

Twenty-five outbreak isolates (18 from patients and 7 from medication vials) and 11 control isolates unrelated to this outbreak were subjected to WGST to elucidate a source of infection. All outbreak isolates were nearly indistinguishable (<5 single-nucleotide polymorphisms), and >21,000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms were identified from unrelated control isolates, suggesting a point source for this outbreak. S. kiliense has been previously implicated in healthcare-related infections; however, the lack of available typing methods has precluded the ability to substantiate point sources.

        "abstract": "Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represents about 85% of the reported cases of lung cancer. Acquired resistance to targeted therapy with epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs), such as gefitinib, is not uncommon. It is thus vital to explore novel strategies to restore sensitivity to gefitinib. Provided that microRNAs (miRNAs) negatively regulate their gene targets at the transcriptional level, it is speculated that miRNA mimetics may reduce the expression, activity and signal transduction of EGFR so that sensitization of tumour sites to gefitinib-induced cytotoxicity can be achieved. Indeed, a growing body of evidence has shown that the manipulation of endogenous levels of miRNA not only attenuates the EGFR/PI3K/Akt phosphorylation cascade, but also restores apoptotic cell death in in vitro models of experimentally-induced gefitinib resistance and provoked tumour regression/shrinkage in xenograft models. These data are in concordant with the clinical data showing that the differential expression profiles of miRNA in tumour tissues and blood associate strongly with drug response and overall survival. Furthermore, another line of studies indicate that the chemopreventive effects of a variety of natural compounds may involve miRNAs. The present review aims to discuss the therapeutic capacity of miRNAs in relation to recent discoveries on EGFR-TKI resistance, including chronic drug exposure and mutations.",

To address whether mutation status provides additional information beyond LDL-cholesterol level, we analyzed premature CHD risk for FH vs unexplained ADH at various percentiles of LDL-cholesterol: the risk ratios were significant for women at 25th percentile (HR, 4.90 [1.69-14.19]) and 50th percentile (HR, 3.44 [1.42-8.32]) but not at 75th percentile (HR, 1.99 [0.95-4.17]), and were not significant for men at any percentile.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that genetic confirmation of ADH may be important to identify patient's risk of CHD, especially for female LDLR mutation carriers.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) features elevated oxidative stress and accelerated atherosclerosis driven by elevated levels of atherogenic lipoproteins relative to subnormal levels of atheroprotective high-density lipoprotein (HDL). Small, dense HDL3 potently protects low-density lipoprotein (LDL) against proinflammatory oxidative damage.\nOBJECTIVE: To determine whether antioxidative and/or anti-inflammatory activities of HDL are defective in FH and whether such defects are corrected by LDL apheresis.\nMETHODS: Antioxidative and antiinflammatory activities of HDL were evaluated as protection of reference LDL from oxidative stress and capacity to prevent accumulation of proinflammatory oxidised lipids, respectively. Lipid surface rigidity of HDL was assessed using a fluorescent probe. HDL components were measured by analytical approaches. Systemic oxidative stress was characterized as plasma 8-isoprostanes.\nRESULTS: Pre-LDL-apheresis, FH patients (n = 10) exhibited elevated systemic oxidative stress (3.3-fold, P < 0.001) vs. sex- and age-matched normolipidemic controls (n = 10). Both antioxidative and antiinflammatory activity of HDL3 were impaired (up to -91%, P < 0.01) in FH. Sphingomyelin and saturated fatty acid contents were elevated in FH HDL3, resulting in enhanced lipid surface rigidity. The surface lipid content (phospholipids, free cholesterol) was reduced in FH (up to -15%, P < 0.001), whereas content of core lipids (cholesteryl esters, triglycerides) was elevated (up to +17%, P < 0.001). Molar apolipoprotein A-I content of HDL3 was subnormal in FH. A single LDL-apheresis session partially corrected (by up to 76%) deficient HDL antiatherogenic activities, attenuated systemic oxidative stress and partially normalised both the lipid composition and surface rigidity of HDL particles.\nCONCLUSIONS: FH features elevated oxidative stress and deficient antioxidative and anti-inflammatory activities of small, dense HDL3; such functional deficiency is intimately linked to anomalies in lipid and protein composition, which may impair the capacity of HDL to acquire and inactivate oxidized lipids.",

MATERIAL AND METHODS Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method was used to detect the genotypes of the 3 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and to analyze the correlation of each SNP with HCC susceptibility in 120 HCC patients and 124 healthy people. The association strength between the 3 SNPs and HCC is represented with odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI). Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) was tested by \u03c72 test in the control group. RESULTS GG genotype of IFN-\u03b3 rs2069727 polymorphism had apparently different distributions in case and control groups (P<0.05), and might confer increased risk of HCC (OR=3.40, 95%CI=1.23-9.38). Analysis of MICA rs2596542 polymorphism also yielded the same result (OR=2.90, 95%CI=1.10-7.67), as did their risk alleles. Specifically, the interaction between rs2596542 and rs2069705 polymorphisms increased the HCC risk by 1.41 times and between rs2596542 and rs2069727 polymorphisms the increased risk of HCC by 5.56 times.

Patients had ophthalmic examination, optical coherence tomography (OCT) and genetic testing. Patients with vision worse than 20/30 were treated with CAI. Post treatment visual acuity (VA), central foveal zone (CFZ) thickness, and qualitative estimation of MCS size were assessed.\nRESULTS: Eighteen patients, 6-47 years old, were included. IVFA was performed in 15 (83%) patients. Of the 26 eyes in 13 patients who were treated and followed, VA improved in 15 eyes (58%) of 10 patients. Ten of these 15 eyes had decreased CFZ thickness and 9/10 showed qualitative MCS improvement. Regression analysis showed that change in CFZ thickness was not significantly predictive of change in final visual acuity (p = 0.405). Five of 15 eyes with improved VA had paradoxically increased CFZ thickness and 2/5 had enlarged MCS. Three of the treated eyes (11%) in two patients had decreased VA with decreased CFZ thickness and improved MCS in 2/3 eyes. Eight eyes (31%) in six patients showed no change in VA with decreased CFZ thickness in 6/8 eyes with improved MCS. Genetic testing showed mutations of NR2E3, XLRS, CRB1, GPR98 and CNGB1.\nCONCLUSION: Non-leaking MCS occur in a variety of retinal dystrophies.

Herein we identified the LaeA in Monascus ruber M7 (MrLaeA), and verified its role to mediate growth, sporulation and secondary metabolism. Results showed that the radial growth rate of the selected MrlaeA knock-out mutant (Mr\u0394laeA-22) was significantly faster than that of the parental strain M. ruber M7, and growth was accompanied by the formation of an abnormal colony phenotype with more abundant aerial hyphae. Interestingly, conidia production of the Mr\u0394laeA-22 strain was about thrice that of M. ruber M7, but ascospores were not observed in the Mr\u0394laeA-22 strain. Additionally, compared to M. ruber M7, Mr\u0394laeA-22 exhibited drastically reduced production of multiple secondary metabolites, especially those of the six well-known Monascus pigments and citrinin. Simultaneously, the selected MrlaeA complementation strain (Mr\u0394laeA::laeA-45) nearly recovered the capacity for sporulation and secondary metabolism observed in the parental strain. These results demonstrate that MrLaeA regulates not only secondary metabolism, but also asexual and sexual differentiation in M. ruber, but some of its regulation appears to differ from other fungi.",

Currently, the Mexican government is developing a biological control program based on extensive application of Isaria isolates against Diaphorina citri (Hemiptera: Liviidae), a vector of citrus huanglongbing disease. Previous research identified three promising Isaria isolates (CHE-CNRCB 303, 305, and 307; tentatively identified as Isaria fumosorosea) from Mexico. The goal of this work was to obtain a complete morphological and molecular characterization of these isolates. Comparative analysis of morphology established that the isolates showed similar characteristics to Isaria javanica. Multi-gene analysis confirmed the morphological identification by including the three isolates within the I. javanica clade. Additionally, this work demonstrated the misidentifications of three other Isaria isolates (CHE-CNRCB 310 and 324: I. javanica, formerly I. fumosorosea; CHE-CNRCB 393: I. fumosorosea, formerly Isaria farinosa), underlying the need for a full and correct characterization of an isolate before developing a biological control program. Finally, the inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) genotyping method revealed that the CHE-CNRCB 303, 305, and 307 isolates belong to three different genotypes.

In the past three decades, genome editing by homologous recombination has been successfully performed in mouse for generating genetic models. The low efficiency of this process in human cells, however, had prevented its clinical application until the recent advancements in designer endonuclease technologies. The significantly improved genome editing efficiencies aided by ZFN, TALEN, and CRISPR systems provide unprecedented opportunities not only for biomedical research, but also for developing novel therapies. Applications based on these genome editing tools to disrupt deleterious genes, correct genetic mutations, deliver functional transgenes more effectively or even modify the epigenetic landscape are being actively investigated for gene and cell therapy purposes. Encouraging results have been obtained in limited clinical trials in the past two years. While most of the applications are still in proof-of-principle or preclinical development stages, it is anticipated that the coming years will see increasing clinical success in novel therapies based on the modern genome editing technologies. It should be noted that critical issues still remain before the technologies can be translated into more reliable therapies. These key issues include off-target evaluation, establishing appropriate preclinical models and improving the currently low efficiency of homology-based precise gene replacement.

        "abstract": "Tamoxifen (TAM) is a widely used drug in the prophylaxis and treatment of breast cancer. TAM is metabolized to the more active 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OH-TAM) and endoxifen by cytochrome P450 (CYP) mainly CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes. Due to the genetic polymorphisms in CYP2D6 genes, high variation in the clinical outcomes of TAM treatment is observed among women of different populations. To address this issue, novel TAM analogues with possible altered activation pathways were synthesized. These analogues were tested for their antiproliferative action on MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines as well as their binding affinity for estrogen receptor (ER) ER-\u03b1 and ER-\u03b2 receptors. These entire novel compounds showed better antiproliferative activity than did TAM on the MCF-7 cells. Moreover, compound 10 exhibited a half maximal growth inhibition (GI50) that was 1000 times more potent than that of TAM (GI50 < 0.005 \u03bcM vs 1.58 \u03bcM, respectively). Along with a broad spectrum activity on various cancer cell lines, all the TAM analogues showed considerable activity on the ER-negative breast cancer cell line. For further study, compound 10 was incubated in human liver microsomes (HLM), human hepatocytes (hHEP) and CYP2D6 supersomes. The active hydroxyl metabolite was detected after incubation in HLM and hHEP, implicating the involvement of other enzymes in its metabolism. These results prove that this novel series of TAM analogues might provide improved clinical outcomes for poor 2D6 metabolizers.",

A significant number of studies have found a correlation between preoperative anxiety and post-operative morbidity. Various methods of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) were found to be effective in alleviating preoperative anxiety. This study examined the relative effectiveness of various individual and generic CAM methods combined with standard treatment (ST) in relieving preoperative anxiety, in comparison with ST alone.\nDESIGN: Randomized controlled trial.\nSETTING: Holding room area\nPATIENTS: Three hundred sixty patients.\nINTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomly divided into 6 equal-sized groups. Group 1 received the standard treatment (ST) for anxiety alleviation with anxiolytics. The five other groups received the following, together with ST (anxiolytics): Compact Disk Recording of Guided Imagery (CDRGI); acupuncture; individual guided imagery; reflexology; and individual guided imagery combined with reflexology, based on medical staff availability.\nMEASUREMENTS: Assessment of anxiety was taken upon entering the holding room area (surgery preparation room) ('pre-treatment assessment'), and following the treatment, shortly before transfer to the operating room ('post-treatment assessment'), based on the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) questionnaire. Data processing included comparison of VAS averages in the 'pre' and 'post' stages among the various groups.\nMAIN RESULTS: Preoperatively, CAM treatments were associated with significant reduction of anxiety level (5.54-2.32, p<0.0001). In contrast, no significant change was noted in the standard treatment group (4.92-5.44, p=0.15). Individualized CAM treatments did not differ significantly in outcomes. However, CDRGI was less effective than individualized CAM (P<0.001), but better than ST (p=0.005).\nCONCLUSIONS: Individual CAM treatments integrated within ST reduce preoperative anxiety significantly, compared to standard treatment alone, and are more effective than generic CDRGI. In light of the scope of preoperative anxiety and its implications for public health, integration of CAM therapies with ST should be considered for reducing preoperative anxiety.",

We demonstrated that our refined adenovirus harboring PEPCK/ApoE-Rz-HSVtk (Ad-PRT-E) achieved great anti-tumor efficacy and improved ability to specifically target HCC without damaging normal hepatocytes. We also showed noninvasive imaging modalities were successfully employed to monitor both how well a therapeutic gene (HSVtk) was expressed inside tumor and how effectively a gene therapy took an action in terms of tumor growth. Collectively, this study suggests that the advanced therapeutic adenoviruses Ad-PRT-E and its image-aided evaluation system may lead to the powerful strategy for successful clinical translation and the development of clinical protocols for HCC therapy.",

A large body of evidence has indicated that DNA MTase is potentially a predictive biomarker closely associated with genetic disorders and genetic diseases like cancer. Given the attention bestowed onto DNA MTases in molecular biology and medicine, highly sensitive detection of DNA MTase activity is essential in determining gene regulation, epigenetic modification, clinical diagnosis and therapeutics. Conventional techniques such as isotope labelling are effective, but they often require laborious sample preparation, isotope labelling, sophisticated equipment and large amounts of DNA, rendering them unsuitable for uses at point-of-care.

In most recent technological advances, many alternative DNA MTase activity assays such as fluorescent, electrochemical, colorimetric and chemiluminescent assays have been proposed. In addition, many of them are coupled with nanomaterials and/or enzymes to significantly enhance their sensitivity.

In this investigation, we tested the hypothesis that induction of cytochrome P450 (Cyp)3a11 gene by paclitaxel is downregulated by the inflammatory mediator, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and that the pro-inflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, attenuates human CYP3A4 gene induction by rifampicin. Primary mouse hepatocytes were pretreated with LPS (1 \u03bcg/ml) for 10 min, followed by paclitaxel (20 \u03bcM) or vehicle for 24 h. RNA was extracted from the cells by trizol method followed by cDNA synthesis and analysis by real-time PCR. Paclitaxel significantly induced gene expression of Cyp3a11 (~30-fold) and this induction was attenuated in LPS-treated samples. Induction and subsequent downregulation of CYP3A enzyme can impact paclitaxel treatment in cancer patients where inflammatory mediators are activated. It has been shown that the nuclear receptor, pregnane X receptor (PXR), plays a role in the induction of CYP enzymes. In order to understand the mechanisms of regulation of human CYP3A4 gene, we co-transfected HepG2 cells (human liver cell line) with CYP3A4-luciferase construct and a PXR expression plasmid. The cells were then treated with the pro-inflammatory cytokine, TNF\u03b1, followed by the prototype CYP3A inducer rifampicin. It is well established that rifampicin activates PXR, leading to CYP3A4 induction. We found that induction of CYP3A4-luciferase activity by rifampicin was significantly attenuated by TNF\u03b1. In conclusion, we describe herein several in vitro approaches entailing primary and cultured hepatocytes, real-time PCR, and transcriptional activation (transfection) assays to investigate the molecular regulation of CYP3A, which plays a pivotal role in the metabolism of numerous chemotherapeutic drugs. Genetic or drug-induced variation in CYP3A and/or PXR expression could contribute to drug resistance to chemotherapeutic agents in cancer patients.",

        "abstract": "Precision medicine promises to improve both the efficacy and safety of therapeutic products by better informing why some patients respond well to a drug, and some experience adverse reactions, while others do not. Pharmacogenomics is a key component of precision medicine and can be utilized to select optimal doses for patients, more precisely identify individuals who will respond to a treatment and avoid serious drug-related toxicities. Since pharmacogenomic biomarker information can help inform drug dosing, efficacy, and safety, pharmacogenomic data are critically reviewed by FDA staff to ensure effective use of pharmacogenomic strategies in drug development and appropriate incorporation into product labels. Pharmacogenomic information may be provided in drug or biological product labeling to inform health care providers about the impact of genotype on response to a drug through description of relevant genomic markers, functional effects of genomic variants, dosing recommendations based on genotype, and other applicable genomic information. The format and content of labeling for biologic drugs will generally follow that of small molecule drugs; however, there are notable differences in pharmacogenomic information that might be considered useful for biologic drugs in comparison to small molecule drugs. Furthermore, the rapid entry of biologic drugs for treatment of rare genetic diseases and molecularly defined subsets of common diseases will likely lead to increased use of pharmacogenomic information in biologic drug labels in the near future. In this review, we outline the general principles of therapeutic product labeling and discuss the utilization of pharmacogenomic information in biologic drug labels.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Dense deposit disease and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome are often caused by Complement Factor H (CFH) mutations. This study describes the retinal abnormalities in dense deposit disease and, for the first time, atypical haemolytic uremic syndrome. It also reviews our understanding of drusen pathogenesis and their relevance for glomerular disease.\nMETHODS: Six individuals with dense deposit disease and one with atypical haemolytic uremic syndrome were studied from 2 to 40 years after presentation. Five had renal transplants. All four who had genetic testing had CFH mutations. Individuals underwent ophthalmological review and retinal photography, and in some cases, optical coherence tomography, and further tests of retinal function.\nRESULTS: All subjects with dense deposit disease had impaired night vision and retinal drusen or whitish-yellow deposits. Retinal atrophy, pigmentation, and hemorrhage were common. In late disease, peripheral vision was restricted, central vision was distorted, and there were scotoma from sub-retinal choroidal neovascular membranes and atypical serous retinopathy. Drusen were present but less prominent in the young person with atypical uremic syndrome due to a heterozygous CFH mutation.\nCONCLUSIONS: Drusen are common in forms of C3 glomerulopathy caused by compound heterozygous or heterozygous CFH mutations. They are useful diagnostically but also impair vision. Drusen have an identical composition to glomerular deposits. They are also identical to the drusen of age-related macular degeneration, and may respond to the same treatments. Individuals with a C3 glomerulopathy should be assessed ophthalmologically at diagnosis, and monitored regularly for vision-threatening complications.",

Co and concomitant tacrolimus dose 6 months preconversion and postconversion were examined. CYP3A5 was genotyped using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Wilcoxon signed rank test and Mann-Whitney U test were used to compare Co and dose between formulations and according to genotypes.\nRESULTS: There was a significant difference in the whole-blood tacrolimus Co between the 2 groups (6.16 \u00b1 1.74 ng/mL vs 4.90 \u00b1 1.06 ng/mL; P = .0001). The mean daily maintenance dose of Prograf was 3.9 \u00b1 2.0 mg/kg (0.06 mg/kg/d), which was reduced to 3.3 \u00b1 1.7 mg/d (0.04 mg/kg/d) with Advograf (P = .01).

Drugs that target specific molecular alterations have been introduced into personalized cancer medicine, but their effects can be modulated by the activities of other genes or molecules. Previous studies aiming to identify multiple molecular alterations for combination therapies are limited by available data. Given the recent large scale of available pharmacogenomic data, it is possible to systematically identify multiple biomarkers that contribute jointly to drug sensitivity, and to identify combination therapies for personalized cancer medicine. In this study, we used pharmacogenomic profiling data provided from two independent cohorts in a systematic in silico investigation of perturbed genes cooperatively associated with drug sensitivity. Our study predicted many pairs of molecular biomarkers that may benefit from the use of combination therapies. One of our predicted biomarker pairs, a mutation in the BRAF gene and upregulated expression of the PIM1 gene, was experimentally validated to benefit from a therapy combining BRAF inhibitor and PIM1 inhibitor in lung cancer. This study demonstrates how pharmacogenomic data can be used to systematically identify potentially cooperative genes and provide novel insights to combination therapies in personalized cancer medicine.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There is growing evidence that the widespread use of Long-Lasting Insecticidal Nets (LLINs) is prompting malaria vectors to shift their biting towards times and places where people are not protected, such as earlier in the evening and/or outdoors. It is uncertain whether these behavioural shifts are due to phenotypic plasticity and/or ecological changes within vector communities that favour more exophilic species, or involve genetic factors within vector species to limit their contact with LLINs. Possibly variation in the time and location of mosquito biting has a genetic basis, but as yet this phenomenon has received little investigation. Here we used a candidate gene approach to investigate whether polymorphisms in selected circadian clock genes could explain variation in the time and location of feeding (indoors versus outside) within a natural population of the major African malaria vector Anopheles arabiensis.\nMETHODS: Host-seeking An. arabiensis were collected from two villages (Lupiro and Sagamaganga) in Tanzania by Human Landing Catch (HLC) technique. Mosquitoes were classified into phenotypes of \"early\" (7 pm-10 pm) or \"late\" biting (4 am -7 am), and host-seeking indoors or outdoors. In these samples we genotyped 34 coding SNPs in 8 clock genes (PER, TIM, CLK, CYC, PDP1, VRI, CRY1, and CRY2), and tested for associations between these SNPs and biting phenotypes. SNPs in 8 mitochondrial genes (ATP6, ATP8, COX1, COX2, COX3, ND3, ND5 and CYTB) were also genotyped to test population subdivision within An. arabiensis.\nRESULTS: The candidate clock genes exhibited polymorphism within An. arabiensis, but it was unrelated to variation in the timing and location of their biting activity. However, there was evidence of strong genetic structure within An. arabiensis populations in association with the TIM, which was unrelated to geographic distance. Substructure within An. arabiensis was also detected using mitochondrial markers.\nCONCLUSIONS: The variable timing and location of biting in An. arabiensis could not be linked to candidate clock genes that are known to influence behaviour in other Diptera. This finding does not rule out the possibility of a genetic basis to biting behaviour in this malaria vector, but suggests these are complex phenotypes that require more intensive ecological, neuronal and genomic analyses to understand.",

Fulfilling this potential requires controllability over engineered behaviors and scalability of the engineered systems. Here, we present a platform technology, microbial swarmbot, which employs spatial arrangement to control the growth dynamics of engineered bacteria. As a proof of principle, we demonstrated a safeguard strategy to prevent unintended bacterial proliferation. In particular, we adopted several synthetic gene circuits to program collective survival in Escherichia coli: the engineered bacteria could only survive when present at sufficiently high population densities. When encapsulated by permeable membranes, these bacteria can sense the local environment and respond accordingly. The cells inside the microbial swarmbot capsules will survive due to their high densities. Those escaping from a capsule, however, will be killed due to a decrease in their densities. We demonstrate that this design concept is modular and readily generalizable.

        "abstract": "Bladder cancer represents the ninth most widespread malignancy throughout the world. It is characterized by the presence of two different clinical and prognostic subtypes: non-muscle-invasive bladder cancers (NMIBCs) and muscle-invasive bladder cancers (MIBCs). MIBCs have a poor outcome with a common progression to metastasis. Despite improvements in knowledge, treatment has not advanced significantly in recent years, with the absence of new therapeutic targets. Because of the limitations of current therapeutic options, the greater challenge will be to identify biomarkers for clinical application. For this reason, we compared our array comparative genomic hybridization (array-CGH) results with those reported in literature for invasive bladder tumors and, in particular, we focused on the evaluation of copy number alterations (CNAs) present in biopsies and retained in the corresponding cancer stem cell (CSC) subpopulations that should be the main target of therapy. According to our data, CCNE1, MYC, MDM2 and PPARG genes could be interesting therapeutic targets for bladder CSC subpopulations. Surprisingly, HER2 copy number gains are not retained in bladder CSCs, making the gene-targeted therapy less interesting than the others. These results provide precious advice for further study on bladder therapy; however, the clinical importance of these results should be explored.",

To better understand the genetic features and evolution of S. agalactiae, multiple factors influencing synonymous codon usage patterns in S. agalactiae were analyzed in this study. A- and U-ending rich codons were used in S. agalactiae function genes through the overall codon usage analysis, indicating that Adenine (A)/Thymine (T) compositional constraints might contribute an important role to the synonymous codon usage pattern. The GC3% against the effective number of codon (ENC) value suggested that translational selection was the important factor for codon bias in the microorganism. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed that (i) mutational pressure was the most important factor in shaping codon usage of all open reading frames (ORFs) in the S. agalactiae genome; (ii) strand specific mutational bias was not capable of influencing the codon usage bias in the leading and lagging strands; and (iii) gene length was not the important factor in synonymous codon usage pattern in this organism. Additionally, the high correlation between tRNA adaptation index (tAI) value and codon adaptation index (CAI), frequency of optimal codons (Fop) value, reinforced the role of natural selection for efficient translation in S. agalactiae. Comparison of synonymous codon usage pattern between S. agalactiae and susceptible hosts (human and tilapia) showed that synonymous codon usage of S. agalactiae was independent of the synonymous codon usage of susceptible hosts. The study of codon usage in S. agalactiae may provide evidence about the molecular evolution of the bacterium and a greater understanding of evolutionary relationships between S. agalactiae and its hosts.",

In China, it is known for its pharmacological properties that are used to treat rheumatic arthritis, sciatica, pertussis, tracheitis and so forth. Its major medicinal active metabolite is hypocrellin A, which exhibits excellent antiviral and antitumor properties. However, the genes involved in the hypocrellin A anabolic pathways were still unknown due to the lack of genomic information for this species. To investigate putative genes that are involved in the biosynthesis of hypocrellin A and determine the pathway, we performed transcriptome sequencing for Shiraia bambusicola S4201-W and the mutant S4201-D1 for the first time. S4201-W has excellent hypocrellin A production, while the mutant S4201-D1 does not. Then, we obtained 38,056,034 and 39,086,896 clean reads from S4201-W and S4201-D1, respectively. In all, 17,923 unigenes were de novo assembled, and the N50 length was 1970 bp. Based on the negative binomial distribution test, 716 unigenes were found to be upregulated, and 188 genes were downregulated in S4201-D1, compared with S4201-W. We have found seven unigenes involved in the biosynthesis of hypocrellin A and proposed a putative hypocrellin A biosynthetic pathway. These data will provide a valuable resource and theoretical basis for future molecular studies of hypocrellin A, help identify the genes involved in the biosynthesis of hypocrellin A and help facilitate functional studies for enhancing hypocrellin A production.",

The most important and well-known function of Rex is stabilizing and exporting viral mRNAs from the nucleus, particularly for unspliced/partially-spliced mRNAs encoding the structural proteins essential for viral replication. Without Rex, these unspliced viral mRNAs would otherwise be completely spliced. Therefore, Rex is vital for the translation of structural proteins and the stabilization of viral genomic RNA and, thus, for viral replication. Rex schedules the period of extensive viral replication and suppression to enter latency. Although the importance of Rex in the viral life-cycle is well understood, the underlying molecular mechanism of how Rex achieves its function has not been clarified. For example, how does Rex protect unspliced/partially-spliced viral mRNAs from the host cellular splicing machinery? How does Rex protect viral mRNAs, antigenic to eukaryotic cells, from cellular mRNA surveillance mechanisms? Here we will discuss these mechanisms, which explain the function of Rex as an organizer of HTLV-1 expression based on previously and recently discovered aspects of Rex.

The syndrome arises from germline mutations in the folliculin (FLCN) gene. We present findings from the single largest family BHD cohort described to date. Primary objectives were to characterize cystic lung changes on computed tomography (CT) chest scanning and identify features that stratify patients at higher risk of pneumothorax. Secondary objectives entailed description of the following: type and natural history of BHD-associated pneumothorax, pulmonary function characteristics, and relationship between cystic lung changes and pulmonary function.\nMETHODS: The study was a retrospective chart review for a case series of a single family. Over 70 family members of a proband with documented BHD were identified, 68 of which consented to genetic testing. All those with confirmed BHD were offered a clinical assessment by the Medical Genetics and Pulmonary services which included a history, physical exam, complete pulmonary function tests, and computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest and abdomen.\nRESULTS: Thirty-six individuals had a heterozygous mutation in the FLCN gene (c.59delT). Of these, 100 % (28/28) had pulmonary cysts, 41 % (13/32) had spontaneous pneumothoraces, 26 % (8/31) had kidney cysts, 3 % (1/31) had renal tumors, and 53 % (18/34) had dermatologic manifestations.

Current therapies suffer from lack of efficacy in a great percentage of cases, especially when cancer is diagnosed at a late stage. Moreover patients' responses vary and the outcome is unpredictable. Therefore, the identification of patients who will benefit most of chemotherapy treatment is important for accurate prognostication and better outcome. In this study, using malignant pleural effusions (MPE) from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, we established a collection of patient-derived Adenocarcinoma cultures which were characterized for their sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs used in the clinical practice.\nMETHODS: Tumor cells present in MPEs of patients with NSCLC were isolated by density gradient centrifugation, placed in culture and genotyped by next generation sequencing. In a subset of cases patient derived xenografts (PDX) were obtained upon tumor cell inoculation in rag2/IL2 knock-out mice. Isolated primary cultures were characterized and tested for drug sensitivity by in vitro proliferation assays. Additivity, antagonism or synergy for combinatorial treatments were determined by analysis with the Calcusyn software.\nRESULTS: We have optimized isolation procedures and culture conditions to expand in vitro primary cultures from Malignant Pleural Effusions (MPEs) of patients affected by lung adenocarcinomas, the most frequent form of non small cell lung cancer. Using this approach we have been able to establish 16 primary cultures from MPEs. Cells were banked at low passages and were characterized for their mutational pattern by next generation sequencing for most common driver mutations in lung cancer. Moreover, amplified cultures were shown to engraft with high efficiency when injected in immunocompromised mice. Cancer cell sensitivity to drugs used in standard chemotherapy regimens was assessed either individually or in combination. Differential chemosensitivity and different mutation profiles were observed which suggests that this isolation method could provide a platform for predicting the efficacy of chemotherapy in the clinical setting. Most importantly for six patients it was possible to establish a correlation between drug response in vitro and response to therapy in the clinic.\nCONCLUSIONS: Results obtained using primary cultured cells from MPEs underscore the heterogeneity of NSCLC in advanced stage as indicated by drug response and mutation profile. Comparison of data obtained from in vitro assays with patients' responses to therapy leads to the conclusion that this strategy may provide a potentially useful approach for evaluating individual chemosensitivity profile and tailor the therapy accordingly. Furthermore, combining MPE-derived primary cultures with their genomic testing allows to identify patients eligible to trials with novel targeted agents.",

It encodes a polypeptide of 343 amino acid residues whose amino acid sequence displays maximum likelihood with uncharacterized proteins from Sphingomonas species. A putative catalytic serine residue of PMGL2 resides in a new variant of a recently discovered GTSAG sequence in which a Thr residue is replaced by a Cys residue (GCSAG). The recombinant PMGL2 was produced in Escherichia coli cells and purified by Ni-affinity chromatography. The resulting protein preferably utilizes short-chain p-nitrophenyl esters (C4 and C8) and therefore is an esterase. It possesses maximum activity at 45\u00b0C in slightly alkaline conditions and has limited thermostability at higher temperatures. Activity of PMGL2 is stimulated in the presence of 0.25-1.5 M NaCl indicating the good salt tolerance of the new enzyme. Mass spectrometric analysis demonstrated that N-terminal methionine in PMGL2 is processed and cysteine residues do not form a disulfide bond.

Interviews included a written conceptual assessment, a concept-mapping activity, and an opportunity to explain the biomechanisms of DNA replication, transcription, and translation. Student reasoning patterns were explored through mixed-method analyses. Results suggested that students must sort mechanistic entities into appropriate mental categories that reflect the nature of MCB mechanisms and that conflation between these categories is common. We also showed how connections between molecular mechanisms and their biological roles are part of building an integrated knowledge network as students develop expertise. We observed differences in the nature of connections between ideas related to different forms of reasoning.

PCR products were sequenced to determine the species and genotypes. The \u03c7(2) test was used to compare differences in infection rates between living conditions or age groups.\nRESULTS: Cryptosporidium spp., E. bieneusi and G. duodenalis were found in 39 (8.0 %), 29 (6.0 %) and 127 (26.2 %) of dogs, and 6 (3.8 %), 9 (5.6 %) and 21 (13.1 %) of cats, respectively. Infection rates of the pathogens in dogs from pet shops and a clinic were higher than those in household dogs, and higher in cats from one animal shelter than from pet shops. No significant differences in infection rates were detected among age groups. Cryptosporidium canis and C. felis were the only Cryptosporidium species found in dogs and cats, respectively. Enterocytozoon bieneusi genotype PtEb IX was the dominant genotype in dogs, whereas Type IV and D were the most common ones in cats.

Co-infection was detected in 24 dogs and 5 cats, especially those living in crowded conditions.\nCONCLUSIONS: Living condition is a major risk factor affecting the occurrence of enteric protists in companion animals in China, and although dogs and cats can be potential sources of human infections, the different distribution of pathogen species and genotypes between dogs and cats suggests that inter-species transmission of these pathogens is probably rare in the study area.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The distributions of species and their responses to climate change are in part determined by their thermal tolerances. However, little is known about how thermal tolerance evolves. To test whether evolutionary extension of thermal limits is accomplished through enhanced cellular stress response (enhanced response), constitutively elevated expression of protective genes (genetic assimilation) or a shift from damage resistance to passive mechanisms of thermal stability (tolerance), we conducted an analysis of the reactionome: the reaction norm for all genes in an organism's transcriptome measured across an experimental gradient. We characterized thermal reactionomes of two common ant species in the eastern U.S, the northern cool-climate Aphaenogaster picea and the southern warm-climate Aphaenogaster carolinensis, across 12 temperatures that spanned their entire thermal breadth.\nRESULTS: We found that at least 2\u00a0% of all genes changed expression with temperature. The majority of upregulation was specific to exposure to low temperatures. The cool-adapted A. picea induced expression of more genes in response to extreme temperatures than did A. carolinensis, consistent with the enhanced response hypothesis. In contrast, under high temperatures the warm-adapted A. carolinensis downregulated many of the genes upregulated in A. picea, and required more extreme temperatures to induce down-regulation in gene expression, consistent with the tolerance hypothesis. We found no evidence for a trade-off between constitutive and inducible gene expression as predicted by the genetic assimilation hypothesis.\nCONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that increases in upper thermal limits may require an evolutionary shift in response mechanism away from damage repair toward tolerance and prevention.",

This approach requires accurate self-evaluation. We examine the extent to which typical adults have insight into their face recognition abilities across four experiments involving nearly 300 participants. The experiments used five tests of face recognition ability: two that tap into the ability to learn and recognize previously unfamiliar faces [the Cambridge Face Memory Test, CFMT; Duchaine, B., & Nakayama, K.

Overall, we find that adults with typical face recognition abilities have only modest insight into their ability to recognize faces on behavioural tests. In a fifth experiment, we assess self-reported face recognition ability in people with CP and find that some people who expect to perform poorly on behavioural tests of face recognition do indeed perform poorly.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Exome sequencing has been utilized to identify genetic variants associated with disease in humans. Identification of loss-of-function mutations with exome sequencing in rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) could lead to valuable animal models of genetic disease. Attempts have been made to identify variants in rhesus macaques by aligning exome data against the rheMac2 draft genome. However, such efforts have been impaired due to the incompleteness and annotation errors associated with rheMac2. We wished to determine whether aligning exome reads against our new, improved rhesus genome, MacaM, could be used to identify high impact, loss-of-function mutations in rhesus macaques that would be relevant to human disease.\nRESULTS: We compared alignments of exome reads from four rhesus macaques, the reference animal and three unrelated animals, against rheMac2 and MacaM. Substantially more reads aligned against MacaM than rheMac2. We followed the Broad Institute's Best Practice guidelines for variant discovery which utilizes the Genome Analysis Toolkit to identify high impact mutations. When rheMac2 was used as the reference genome, a large number of apparent false positives were identified. When MacaM was used as the reference genome, the number of false positives was greatly reduced. After examining the variant analyses conducted with MacaM as reference genome, we identified two putative loss-of-function mutations, in the heterozygous state, in genes related to human health. Sanger sequencing confirmed the presence of these mutations. We followed the transmission of one of these mutations (in the butyrylthiocholine gene) through three generations of rhesus macaques. Further, we demonstrated a functional decrease in butyrylthiocholinesterase activity similar to that observed in human heterozygotes with loss-of-function mutations in the same gene.\nCONCLUSIONS: The new MacaM genome can be effectively utilized to identify loss-of-function mutations in rhesus macaques without generating a high level of false positives. In some cases, heterozygotes may be immediately useful as models of human disease. For diseases where homozygous mutants are needed, directed breeding of loss-of-function heterozygous animals could be used to create rhesus macaque models of human genetic disease. The approach we describe here could be applied to other mammals, but only if their genomes have been improved beyond draft status.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Definitive radiotherapy is often used for chest wall desmoid tumours due to size or anatomical location. The delivery of radiotherapy is challenging due to the large size and constraints of normal surrounding structures. We compared the dosimetry of 3D conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT), intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and volumetric-modulated arc radiotherapy (VMAT) to evaluate the best treatment option.\nMETHODS AND MATERIALS: Ten consecutive patients with inoperable chest wall desmoid tumours (PTV range 416-4549 cm(3)) were selected. For each patient, 3DCRT, IMRT and VMAT plans were generated and the Conformity Index (CI), organ at risk (OAR) doses and monitor unit (MU) were evaluated. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare dose delivered to both target and OARs.\nRESULTS: The mean number of fields for 3DCRT and IMRT were 6.3 \u00b1 2.1, 7.2 \u00b1 1.8. The mean number of arcs for VMAT was 3.7 \u00b1 1.1. The mean conformity index of VMAT (0.98 \u00b1 0.14) was similar to that of IMRT (1.03 \u00b1 0.13), both of which were significantly better than 3DCRT (1.35 \u00b1 0.20; p = 0.005). The mean dose to lung was significantly higher for 3DCRT (11.9Gy \u00b1 7.9) compared to IMRT (9.4Gy \u00b1 5.4, p = 0.014) and VMAT (8.9Gy \u00b1 4.5, p = 0.017). For the 3 females, the low dose regions in the ipsilateral breast for VMAT were generally less with VMAT. IMRT plans required 1427 \u00b1 532 MU per fraction which was almost 4-fold higher than 3DCRT (313 \u00b1 112, P = 0.005). Compared to IMRT, VMAT plans required 60 % less MU (570 \u00b1 285, P = 0.005).\nCONCLUSIONS: For inoperable chest wall desmoid tumours, VMAT delivered equivalent target coverage when compared to IMRT but required 60 % less MU. Both VMAT and IMRT were superior to 3DCRT in terms of better PTV coverage and sparing of lung tissue.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The DNA base composition is well known to be highly variable among organisms. Bio-physic studies on the effect of the GC increments on the DNA structure have shown that GC-richer DNA sequences are more bendable. The result was the keystone of the hypothesis proposing the metabolic rate as the major force driving the GC content variability, since an increased resistance to the torsion stress is mainly required during the transcription process to avoid DNA breakage. Hence, the aim of the present work is to test if both salinity and migration, suggested to affect the metabolic rate of teleostean fishes, affect the average genomic GC content as well. Moreover, since the gill surface has been reported to be a major morphological expression of metabolic rate, this parameter was also analyzed in the light of the above hypothesis.\nRESULTS: Teleosts living in different environments (freshwater and seawater) and with different lifestyles (migratory and non-migratory) were analyzed studying three variables: routine metabolic rate, gill area and genomic GC-content, none of them showing a phylogenetic signal among fish species. Routine metabolic rate, specific gill area and average genomic GC were higher in seawater than freshwater species. The same trend was observed comparing migratory versus non-migratory species. Crossing salinity and lifestyle, the active migratory species living in seawater show coincidentally the highest routine metabolic rate, the highest specific gill area and the highest average genomic GC content.\nCONCLUSIONS: The results clearly highlight that environmental factors (salinity) and lifestyle (migration) affect not only the physiology (i.e. the routine metabolic rate), and the morphology (i.e. gill area) of teleosts, but also basic genome feature (i.e. the GC content), thus opening to an interesting liaison among the three variables in the light of the metabolic rate hypothesis.",

Botulinum neurotoxins are classified into serotypes (BoNT/A-G), which are produced by six species/Groups of Clostridia, but the genetic background of the bacteria remains poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to use comparative genomics to provide insights into the genetic diversity and evolutionary history of bacteria that produce the potent botulinum neurotoxin.\nRESULTS: Comparative genomic analyses of over 170 Clostridia genomes, including our draft genome assemblies for 59 newly sequenced Clostridia strains from six continents and publicly available genomic data, provided in-depth insights into the diversity and distribution of BoNT-producing bacteria. These newly sequenced strains included Group I and II strains that express BoNT/A,/B,/E, or/F as well as bivalent strains. BoNT-producing Clostridia and closely related Clostridia species were delineated with a variety of methods including 16S rRNA gene, concatenated marker genes, core genome and concatenated multi-locus sequencing typing (MLST) gene phylogenies that related whole genome sequenced strains to publicly available strains and sequence types. These analyses illustrated the phylogenetic diversity in each Group and the diversity of genomic backgrounds that express the same toxin type or subtype. Comparisons of the botulinum neurotoxin genes did not identify novel toxin types or variants.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study represents one of the most comprehensive analyses of whole genome sequence data for Group I and II BoNT-producing strains. Read data and draft genome assemblies generated for 59 isolates will be a resource to the research community. Core genome phylogenies proved to be a powerful tool for differentiating BoNT-producing strains and can provide a framework for the study of these bacteria. Comparative genomic analyses of Clostridia species illustrate the diversity of botulinum-neurotoxin-producing strains and the plasticity of the genomic backgrounds in which bont genes are found.",

The production of wax esters proceeds under anaerobic conditions, designated as wax ester fermentation. In spite of the importance and usefulness of Euglena, the genome and transcriptome data are currently unavailable, though another research group has recently published E.gracilis transcriptome study during our submission. We herein performed an RNA-Seq analysis to provide a comprehensive sequence resource and some insights into the regulation of genes including wax ester metabolism by comparative transcriptome analysis of E.gracilis under aerobic and anaerobic conditions.\nRESULTS: The E.gracilis transcriptome analysis was performed using the Illumina platform and yielded 90.3 million reads after the filtering steps. A total of 49,826 components were assembled and identified as a reference sequence of E.gracilis, of which 26,479 sequences were considered to be potentially expressed (having FPKM value of greater than 1). Approximately half of all components were estimated to be regulated in a trans-splicing manner, with the addition of protruding spliced leader sequences. Nearly 40\u00a0% of 26,479 sequences were annotated by similarity to Swiss-Prot database using the BLASTX program. A total of 2080 transcripts were identified as differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in response to anaerobic treatment for 24\u00a0h. A comprehensive pathway enrichment analysis using the KEGG pathway revealed that the majority of DEGs were involved in photosynthesis, nucleotide metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, fatty acid metabolism. We successfully identified a candidate gene set of paramylon and wax esters, including novel \u03b2-1,3-glucan and wax ester synthases. A comparative expression analysis of aerobic- and anaerobic-treated E.gracilis cells indicated that gene expression changes in these components were not extensive or dynamic during the anaerobic treatment.\nCONCLUSION: The RNA-Seq analysis provided comprehensive transcriptome information on E.gracilis for the first time, and this information will advance our understanding of this unique organism. The comprehensive analysis indicated that paramylon and wax ester metabolic pathways are regulated at post-transcriptional rather than the transcriptional level in response to anaerobic conditions.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Plant architecture attributes, such as plant height, ear height, and internode number, have played an important role in the historical increases in grain yield, lodging resistance, and biomass in maize (Zea mays L.). Analyzing the genetic basis of variation in plant architecture using high density QTL mapping will be of benefit for the breeding of maize for many traits. However, the low density of molecular markers in existing genetic maps has limited the efficiency and accuracy of QTL mapping. Genotyping by sequencing (GBS) is an improved strategy for addressing a complex genome via next-generation sequencing technology. GBS has been a powerful tool for SNP discovery and high-density genetic map construction. The creation of ultra-high density genetic maps using large populations of advanced recombinant inbred lines (RILs) is an efficient way to identify QTL for complex agronomic traits.\nRESULTS: A set of 314 RILs derived from inbreds Ye478 and Qi319 were generated and subjected to GBS. A total of 137,699,000 reads with an average of 357,376 reads per individual RIL were generated, which is equivalent to approximately 0.07-fold coverage of the maize B73 RefGen_V3 genome for each individual RIL. A high-density genetic map was constructed using 4183 bin markers (100-Kb intervals with no recombination events). The total genetic distance covered by the linkage map was 1545.65\u00a0cM and the average distance between adjacent markers was 0.37\u00a0cM with a physical distance of about 0.51\u00a0Mb. Our results demonstrated a relatively high degree of collinearity between the genetic map and the B73 reference genome. The quality and accuracy of the bin map for QTL detection was verified by the mapping of a known gene, pericarp color 1 (P1), which controls the color of the cob, with a high LOD value of 80.78 on chromosome 1. Using this high-density bin map, 35 QTL affecting plant architecture, including 14 for plant height, 14 for ear height, and seven for internode number were detected across three environments. Interestingly, pQTL10, which influences all three of these traits, was stably detected in three environments on chromosome 10 within an interval of 14.6\u00a0Mb. Two MYB transcription factor genes, GRMZM2G325907 and GRMZM2G108892, which might regulate plant cell wall metabolism are the candidate genes for qPH10.\nCONCLUSIONS: Here, an ultra-high density accurate linkage map for a set of maize RILs was constructed using a GBS strategy. This map will facilitate identification of genes and exploration of QTL for plant architecture in maize. It will also be helpful for further research into the mechanisms that control plant architecture while also providing a basis for marker-assisted selection.",

Many sequence elements that direct post-transcriptional regulation have been found; in mammals, most such elements are located within the 3' untranslated regions (3'UTRs). Comparative genomic studies demonstrate that mammalian 3'UTRs contain extensive conserved sequence tracts, yet only a small fraction corresponds to recognized elements, implying that many additional novel elements exist. Despite a variety of computational, molecular, and biochemical approaches, identifying functional 3'UTRs elements remains difficult.\nRESULTS: We created a high-throughput cell-based screen that enables identification of functional post-transcriptional 3'UTR regulatory elements. Our system exploits integrated single-copy reporters, which are expressed and processed as endogenous genes. We screened many thousands of short random sequences for their regulatory potential. Control sequences with known effects were captured effectively using our approach, establishing that our methodology was robust. We found hundreds of functional sequences, which we validated in traditional reporter assays, including verifying their regulatory impact in native sequence contexts. Although 3'UTRs are typically considered repressive, most of the functional elements were activating, including ones that were preferentially conserved. Additionally, we adapted our screening approach to examine the effect of elements on RNA abundance, revealing that most elements act by altering mRNA stability.\nCONCLUSIONS: We developed and used a high-throughput approach to discover hundreds of post-transcriptional cis-regulatory elements. These results imply that most human 3'UTRs contain many previously unrecognized cis-regulatory elements, many of which are activating, and that the post-transcriptional fate of an mRNA is largely due to the actions of many individual cis-regulatory elements within its 3'UTR.",

We detail the systematic, iterative process that implementation partners, Lighthouse clinic and Baobab Health Trust, employed to develop and implement a point-of-care electronic medical records system in an integrated, public clinic in Malawi that serves HIV-infected and tuberculosis (TB) patients.\nMETHODS: Baobab Health Trust, the system developers, conducted a series of technical and clinical meetings with Lighthouse and Ministry of Health to determine specifications. Multiple pre-testing sessions assessed patient flow, question clarity, information sequencing, and verified compliance to national guidelines. Final components of the TB/HIV electronic medical records system include: patient demographics; anthropometric measurements; laboratory samples and results; HIV testing; WHO clinical staging; TB diagnosis; family planning; clinical review; and drug dispensing.\nRESULTS: Our experience suggests that an electronic medical records system can improve patient management, enhance integration of TB/HIV services, and improve provider decision-making. However, despite sufficient funding and motivation, several challenges delayed system launch including: expansion of system components to include of HIV testing and counseling services; changes in the national antiretroviral treatment guidelines that required system revision; and low confidence to use the system among new healthcare workers. To ensure a more robust and agile system that met all stakeholder and user needs, our electronic medical records launch was delayed more than a year. Open communication with stakeholders, careful consideration of ongoing provider input, and a well-functioning, backup, paper-based TB registry helped ensure successful implementation and sustainability of the system. Additional, on-site, technical support provided reassurance and swift problem-solving during the extended launch period.\nCONCLUSION: Even when system users are closely involved in the design and development of an electronic medical record system, it is critical to allow sufficient time for software development, solicitation of detailed feedback from both users and stakeholders, and iterative system revisions to successfully transition from paper to point-of-care electronic medical records. For those in low-resource settings, electronic medical records for integrated care is a possible and positive innovation.",

DNA microarrays often comprise many DNA markers (features). Feature selection and the development of prediction models are particularly challenging in this domain with many variables and comparatively few subjects or data points. We aimed to compare modeling strategies to develop prediction models for classifying infections as clinical or environmental.\nMETHODS: We applied a bootstrap strategy for preselecting important features to a database containing 222 Legionella pneumophila strains with 448 continuous markers and a dichotomous outcome (clinical or environmental). Feature selection was done with 50 bootstrap samples resulting in a top 10 of most important features for each of four modeling techniques: classification and regression trees (CART), random forests (RF), support vector machines (SVM) and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). Validation was done in a second bootstrap re-sampling loop (200\u00d7) for evaluation of discriminatory model performance according to the AUC.\nRESULTS: The top 5 of selected features differed considerably between the various modeling techniques, with only one common feature (\"LePn.007B8\"). The mean validated AUC-values of the SVM model and the CART model were 0.859 and 0.873 respectively. The LASSO and the RF model showed higher validated AUC-values (0.925 and 0.975 respectively).\nCONCLUSIONS: In the domain of Legionella pneumophila, which comprises many potential features for classifying of infections as clinical or environmental, the RF and LASSO techniques provide good prediction models. The identification of potentially biologically relevant features is highly dependent on the technique used, and should hence be interpreted with caution.",

        "title": "Well-Being and Agency in Parents of Children With Congenital Heart Disease: A Survey in Chile.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Parents of children having congenital heart diseases (CHDs) develop symptoms of depression, distress, anxiety, and hopelessness more frequently than parents of healthy children. Associated with the described symptoms, parents may experience a lack of control and disempowerment, which decreases the parent's agency, a construct from development studies, and which may have negative consequences on adherence to treatment. The primary aim of this study was to assess the effect of medical treatment on well-being and agency in parents of children having CHDs, in Chile, and to compare it with reference values.\nMETHODS: Forty parents of children having CHDs (before surgery and before hospital discharge) and 115 parents of healthy children were surveyed. The following scales were applied to this population: the General Health Questionnaire, the Basic Psychological Needs Scales, the Self-Determination Scale, the Beck Hopelessness Scale, and a socioeconomic survey.\nRESULTS: Children's surgery decreased parents' hopelessness (3.13 \u00b1 0.35 and 2.18 \u00b1 0.40, P = .04), and no significant differences were found in the remaining scales. Parents of children with CHDs scored significantly worse than parents of healthy children on the General Health Questionnaire (13.82 \u00b1 1.03 and 9.21 \u00b1 0.64, P = .001). This difference was not found using the others scales.\nCONCLUSION: Children's surgery has a positive effect on parent's hopelessness, but it does not have any impact on their well-being nor agency. Parents of children with CHD have a decreased well-being compared to parents of healthy children but have a similar level of agency. Socioeconomic level and gender may influence this association.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The development of low cardiac output syndrome (LCOS) after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) occurs in up to 25% of neonates and is associated with increased morbidity. Invasive cardiac output monitors such as pulmonary artery catheters have limited availability and are costly. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a noninvasive tool for monitoring regional oxygenation in neonates in the cardiac intensive care unit (CICU). We hypothesize that anterior abdominal NIRS may aid in the early identification of LCOS after cardiac surgery.\nMETHODS: Prospective observational study from October 2013 to October 2014 of all neonates with congenital heart disease admitted to the CICU following CPB. Abdominal NIRS values were continuously recorded upon CICU admission and for the subsequent 24-hour period. The primary outcome was the development of LCOS. Low cardiac output syndrome was defined as the presence of metabolic lactic acidosis (pH < 7.3 and lactate > 4) or addition of a new vasoactive agent or a vasoactive inotropic score > 15. Autoregressive time series models were constructed for each patient based on the continuously recorded NIRS values, and patients were stratified by development of LCOS.\nRESULTS: Twenty-seven neonates met inclusion criteria, of whom 11 developed LCOS. Neonates who developed LCOS had lower constant NIRS values (49% vs. 66%, P < .001). Constant NIRS values less than 58% best predicted development of LCOS with a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 69%.\nCONCLUSION: Lower constant anterior abdominal NIRS values in the early postoperative period may allow early identification of neonates at risk for LCOS.",

        "abstract": "The development of oncolytic viruses has led to an emerging new class of cancer therapeutics. Although the safety profile has been encouraging, the transition of oncolytic viruses to the clinical setting has been a slow process due to modifications. Therefore, a new generation of more potent oncolytic viruses needs to be exploited, following our better understanding of the complex interactions between the tumor, its microenvironment, the virus, and the host immune response. The conventional method for creation of tumor-targeted oncolytic viruses is based on homologous recombination. However, the creation of new mutant oncolytic viruses with large genomes remains a challenge due to the multi-step process and low efficiency of homologous recombination. The CRISPR-associated endonuclease Cas9 has hugely advanced the potential to edit the genomes of various organisms due to the ability of Cas9 to target a specific genomic site by a single guide RNA. In this review, we discuss the CRISPR-Cas9 system as an efficient viral editing method for the creation of new oncolytic viruses, as well as its potential future applications in the development of oncolytic viruses. Further, this review discusses the potential of off-target effects as well as CRISPR-Cas9 as a tool for basic research into viral biology.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS/ME) is a complex multisystem disease of unknown aetiology which causes debilitating symptoms in up to 1% of the global population. Although a large cohort of genes have been shown to exhibit altered expression in CFS/ME patients, it is currently unknown whether microRNA (miRNA) molecules which regulate gene translation contribute to disease pathogenesis. We hypothesized that changes in microRNA expression in patient leukocytes contribute to CFS/ME pathology, and may therefore represent useful diagnostic biomarkers that can be detected in the peripheral blood of CFS/ME patients.\nMETHODS: miRNA expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from CFS/ME patients and healthy controls was analysed using the Ambion Bioarray V1. miRNA demonstrating differential expression were validated by qRT-PCR and then replicated in fractionated blood leukocyte subsets from an independent patient cohort. The CFS/ME associated miRNA identified by these experiments were then transfected into primary NK cells and gene expression analyses conducted to identify their gene targets.\nRESULTS: Microarray analysis identified differential expression of 34 miRNA, all of which were up-regulated. Four of the 34 miRNA had confirmed expression changes by qRT-PCR. Fractionating PBMC samples by cell type from an independent patient cohort identified changes in miRNA expression in NK-cells, B-cells and monocytes with the most significant abnormalities occurring in NK cells. Transfecting primary NK cells with hsa-miR-99b or hsa-miR-330-3p, resulted in gene expression changes consistent with NK cell activation but diminished cytotoxicity, suggesting that defective NK cell function contributes to CFS/ME pathology.\nCONCLUSION: This study demonstrates altered microRNA expression in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of CFS/ME patients, which are potential diagnostic biomarkers. The greatest degree of miRNA deregulation was identified in NK cells with targets consistent with cellular activation and altered effector function.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Introduction of vector species into new areas represents a main driver for the emergence and worldwide spread of vector-borne diseases. This poses a substantial threat to livestock economies and public health. Culicoides imicola Kieffer, a major vector species of economically important animal viruses, is described with an apparent range expansion in Europe where it has been recorded in south-eastern continental France, its known northern distribution edge. This questioned on further C. imicola population extension and establishment into new territories. Studying the spatio-temporal genetic variation of expanding populations can provide valuable information for the design of reliable models of future spread.\nMETHODS: Entomological surveys and population genetic approaches were used to assess the spatio-temporal population dynamics of C. imicola in France. Entomological surveys (2-3 consecutive years) were used to evaluate population abundances and local spread in continental France (28 sites in the Var department) and in Corsica (4 sites). We also genotyped at nine microsatellite loci insects from 3 locations in the Var department over 3 years (2008, 2010 and 2012) and from 6 locations in Corsica over 4 years (2002, 2008, 2010 and 2012).\nRESULTS: Entomological surveys confirmed the establishment of C. imicola populations in Var department, but indicated low abundances and no apparent expansion there within the studied period. Higher population abundances were recorded in Corsica. Our genetic data suggested the absence of spatio-temporal genetic changes within each region but a significant increase of the genetic differentiation between Corsican and Var populations through time. The lack of intra-region population structure may result from strong gene flow among populations. We discussed the observed temporal variation between Corsica and Var as being the result of genetic drift following introduction, and/or the genetic characteristics of populations at their range edge.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that local range expansion of C. imicola in continental France may be slowed by the low population abundances and unsuitable climatic and environmental conditions.",

While the majority of genomic studies have focused on genetic risk variants, known risk variants account for at most 30% of FBC cases. Considering that multiple genes may influence FBC risk, we hypothesized that a pathway-based strategy examining different data types from multiple tissues could elucidate the biological basis for FBC. In this study, we performed integrated analyses of gene expression and exome-sequencing data from peripheral blood mononuclear cells and showed that cell adhesion pathways are significantly and consistently dysregulated in women who develop FBC. The dysregulation of cell adhesion pathways in high-risk women was also identified by pathway-based profiling applied to normal breast tissue data from two independent cohorts. The results of our genomic analyses were validated in normal primary mammary epithelial cells from high-risk and control women, using cell-based functional assays, drug-response assays, fluorescence microscopy, and Western blotting assays. Both genomic and cell-based experiments indicate that cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix adhesion processes seem to be disrupted in non-malignant cells of women at high risk for FBC and suggest a potential role for these processes in FBC development.",

We used human colorectal cancer specimens and the colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line HRT18 for this purpose.\nRESULTS: Our cohort screening data showed that in patients with colorectal cancer, low expression of EPHA1 gene is correlated with a remarkably reduced survival. After EPHA1 is knocked-down in colorectal cancer cells using a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-associated nuclease 9 (CRISPR-CAS9) genomic editing system, we observed an increase in the spreading and adhesion of HRT18 cells. Moreover, protein array data indicated that the extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathways were activated as a consequence. Inhibition of ERK and JNK proteins with specific inhibitors led to suppression of migration of the colorectal cancer cells.\nCONCLUSION: EPHA1 suppresses spreading and adhesion of HRT18 colorectal cancer cells through deactivation of ERK and JNK signaling pathways.",

Consecutive self-referred CRC screening participants aged 40-70 years were recruited, and each subject received one direct optical colonoscopy. The prevalence of CRC, ACN, and colorectal adenoma was compared among subjects with different FDRs affected using Pearson's \u03c72 tests. Binary logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate the risk of these lesions, controlling for recognized risk factors including age, gender, smoking habits, alcohol drinking, body mass index, and the presence of diabetes mellitus.\nRESULTS: Among 11,797 asymptomatic subjects, the prevalence of CRC was 0.6% (none: 0.6%; siblings: 1.1%; mother: 0.5%; father: 1.2%; \u22652 members: 3.1%, P<0.001), that of ACN was 6.5% (none: 6.1%; siblings: 8.3%; mother: 7.7%; father: 8.7%; \u22652 members: 9.3%, P<0.001), and that of colorectal adenoma was 29.3% (none: 28.6%; siblings: 33.5%; mother: 31.8%; father: 31.1%; \u22652 members: 38.1%, P<0.001). In multivariate regression analyses, subjects with at least one FDR affected were significantly more likely to have CRC (adjusted odds ratio (AOR)=2.02-7.89), ACN (AOR=1.55-2.06), and colorectal adenoma (AOR=1.31-1.92) than those without a family history.

Cellular microRNAs were reported to interfere to different extents with the replication of specific picornaviruses, mostly acting as inhibitors. However, owing to the high error rate of their RNA-dependent RNA-polymerases, picornavirus quasi-species are expected to evolve rapidly in order to lose any detrimental microRNA target sequence. We examined the genome of Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) for the presence of under-represented microRNA target sequences that could have been selected against during virus evolution. However, little evidence for such sequences was found in the genome of TMEV and introduction of the most under-represented microRNA target (miR-770-3p) in TMEV did not significantly affect viral replication in cells expressing this microRNA. To test the global impact of cellular microRNAs on viral replication, we designed a strategy based on short-term Dicer inactivation in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Short-term Dicer inactivation led to a >10-fold decrease in microRNA abundance and strongly increased replication of Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), which was used as a microRNA-sensitive control virus. In contrast, Dicer inactivation did not increase TMEV replication. In conclusion, cellular microRNAs appear to exert little influence on Theiler's virus fitness.",

Nonetheless, the subcommittee believes that genotoxicity testing of new ONs is warranted because modified monomers could be liberated from a metabolized ON and incorporated into DNA and could hypothetically cause chain termination, miscoding, and/or faulty replication or repair. The standard test battery as described in Option 1 of International Conference on Harmonisation S2(R1) is generally adequate to assess such potential. However, for the in vitro assay for gene mutations, mammalian cells are considered more relevant than bacteria for most ONs due to their known responsiveness to nucleosides and their greater potential for ON uptake; on the other hand, bacterial assays may be more appropriate for ONs containing non-ON components. Testing is not recommended for ONs with only naturally occurring chemistries or for ONs with chemistries for which there is documented lack of genotoxicity in systems with demonstrated cellular uptake. Testing is recommended for ONs that contain non-natural chemical modifications and use of the complete drug product (including linkers, conjugates, and liposomes) is suggested to provide the most clinically relevant assessment. Documentation of uptake into cells comparable to those used for genotoxicity testing is proposed because intracellular exposure cannot be assumed for these large molecules. ONs could also hypothetically cause mutations through triple helix formation with genomic DNA and no tests are available for detection of such sequence-specific mutations across the entire genome. However, because the potential for triplex formation by therapeutic ONs is extremely low, this potential can be assessed adequately by sequence analysis.",

Reported ocular findings associated with cblC have been maculopathy, pigmentary retinopathy, and optic nerve atrophy. Cobalamin A disease (cblA) which causes an isolated methylmalonic acidemia without homocystinuria is rarer than cblC. This is the first detailed report of the ocular findings associated with cblA. We also describe the spectrum of ocular findings in our cblC patients.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: A case series describing the ophthalmologic clinical course of six patients with a diagnosis of cobalamin C type and one patient with cobalamin A type of methylmalonic acidemia. Patients were diagnosed through biochemical laboratory testing and genetic analysis was conducted on most patients. Longitudinal fundus findings, optical coherence tomography (OCT), autofluorescence, and electrophysiology were followed in the patients.\nRESULTS: The cblA patient demonstrated a relatively mild ocular phenotype with late-onset and slowly progressing temporal disc pallor and peripapillary atrophy in the second decade of life. The patient maintained good visual acuity and central vision, without evidence of maculopathy. The six cblC patients demonstrated a range of ocular findings from unremarkable and mild phenotypes to significant retinopathy, including bull's eye maculopathy, severe maculopathy with punched out chorioretinal atrophy, peripheral bone spicules, and optic nerve atrophy.\nCONCLUSIONS: The spectrum of ocular manifestations seen with inherited disorders of cobalamin metabolism is wide, ranging from mild optic nerve atrophy to severe macular or retinal degeneration. This heterogeneity may in part reflect the associated biochemical phenotype, such as that observed between our cblA and cblC patients.

A better understanding of space distribution features in this area was needed to guide strategies to eliminate visceral leishmaniasis from highly endemic areas. We performed a spatial analysis using the data collected in Bosh Klum Township in Xinjiang China.\nMETHODS: Based on the report of endemic diseases between 1990 and 2005, three villages with a high number of visceral leishmaniasis cases in Bosh Klum Township were selected. We conducted a household survey to collect the baseline data of kala-azar patients using standard case definitions. The geographical information was recorded with GIS equipment. A binomial distribution fitting test, runs test, and Scan statistical analysis were used to assess the space distribution of the study area.\nRESULTS: The result of the binomial distribution fitting test showed that the distribution of visceral leishmaniasis cases in local families was inconsistent (\u03c7(2)\u2009=\u200953.23, P\u2009<\u20090.01). The results of runs test showed that the distribution of leishmaniasis infected families along the channel was not random in the group of more than five infected families. The proportion of this kind of group in all infected families was 63.84 % (113 of 177). In the Scan statistical analysis, spatial aggregation was analyzed by poisson model, which found 3 spatial distribution areas 1) Zone A was located in a center point of 76.153447\u00b0E, 39.528477\u00b0N within its 1.11 mile radius, where the cumulative life-incidence of leishmaniasis was 1.95 times as high as that in surrounding areas (P\u2009<\u20090.05); 2) Zone B was located in a center point of 76.111968\u00b0E, 39.531895\u00b0N within its 0.54 mile radius, where the cumulative life-incidence of leishmaniasis was 1.82 times as high as that in surrounding areas (P\u2009<\u20090.01); and 3) Zone C was located in a center point of 76.195427\u00b0E, 39.563835\u00b0N within its 0.68 mile radius, where the cumulative life-incidence of leishmaniasis was 1.31 times as high as that in surrounding areas (P\u2009<\u20090.05).\nCONCLUSIONS: The spatial distribution of visceral leishmaniasis-infected families was clustered. Thus, the proper use of this finding would be an improvement in highly endemic areas, which could help identify the types of endemic areas and population at high risk and carry out appropriate measures to prevent and control VL in this area as well.",

While a longstanding focus has been on understanding lower limb recovery responses, the upper limbs also play a critical role. However, when a fall occurs, little is known about the role of memory and attention shifting on the reach to grasp recovery strategy and what factors determine the speed and precision of this response beyond simple reaction time. The objective of this study was to compare response time and accuracy of a stabilizing grasp following a balance perturbation in older adult fallers compared to non-fallers and younger adults while loading the processing demands of non-spatial, verbal working memory. Working memory was engaged with a progressively challenging verb-generation task that was interrupted by an unexpected sideways platform perturbation and a pre-instructed reach to grasp response. Results revealed that the older adults, particularly those at high fall risk, demonstrated significantly increased movement time to handrail contact and grasping errors during conditions in which non-spatial memory was actively engaged. These findings provide preliminary evidence of the cognitive deficit in attention shifting away from an ongoing working memory task that underlies delayed and inaccurate protective reach to grasp responses in older adult fallers.",

In this study, we developed a system to monitor human gait in an outdoor environment using an inertial measurement unit consisting of a tri-axial accelerometer and tri-axial gyroscope. Step-by-step foot trajectories were estimated from the sensor unit attached to the dorsum of the foot. Specifically, stride length and foot clearance were calculated by integrating the gravity-compensated translational acceleration over time during the swing phase. Zero vertical velocity and displacement corrections were applied to obtain the final trajectory, assuming the slope of the walking surface is negligible. Short, normal, and long stride-length walking of 10 healthy participants was simultaneously measured using the proposed system and a conventional motion capture system to evaluate the accuracy of the estimated foot trajectory. Mean accuracy and precision were approximately 20 \u00b1 50 mm, for stride length, and 2 \u00b1 7 mm for foot clearance, indicating that the swing phase trajectory of the sensor unit attached to the foot was reconstructed more accurately and precisely using the proposed system than with previously published methods owing to the flat floor assumption. Although some methodological limitations certainly apply, this system will serve as a useful tool to monitor human walking during daily activities.",

We formed 2 partially overlapping GRSs: GRS47 of 47 single-nucleotide polymorphisms with previously reported significant association with coronary artery disease and GRS153 of 153 single-nucleotide polymorphisms with significant or suggestive association with coronary artery disease. GRS47 showed association with recurrent ACS independent of clinical factors (P=0.037; hazard ratio, 1.17; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.36). GRS153 had no association with either recurrent ACS or composite of recurrent ACS or death. Also, GRS47 was associated inversely with smoking and ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (P=0.004; odds ratio, 0.22; 95% confidence interval, 0.08-0.62 and P=0.041; odds ratio, 0.36; 95% confidence interval, 0.13-0.96, respectively).\nCONCLUSIONS: GRSs combined of 47 known coronary artery disease risk single-nucleotide polymorphisms were associated with recurrent ACS after multivariable adjustments in a heterogenic ACS population for the first time. Smoking and ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction had an inverse association with the GRSs. The significance of smoking in relation to genetic coronary artery disease predisposition may merit further evaluation in patients with ACS.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Rice is a major staple food crop in the world. Over 80% of rice cultivation area is under indica rice. Currently, genomic resources are lacking for indica as compared to japonica rice. In this study, we generated deep-sequencing data (Illumina and Pacific Biosciences sequencing) for one of the indica rice cultivars, HR-12 from India.\nRESULTS: We assembled over 86% (389 Mb) of rice genome and annotated 56,284 protein-coding genes from HR-12 genome using Illumina and PacBio sequencing. Comprehensive comparative analyses between indica and japonica subspecies genomes revealed a large number of indica specific variants including SSRs, SNPs and InDels. To mine disease resistance genes, we sequenced few indica rice cultivars that are reported to be highly resistant (Tetep and Tadukan) and susceptible (HR-12 and Co-39) against blast fungal isolates in many countries including India. Whole genome sequencing of rice genotypes revealed high rate of mutations in defense related genes (NB-ARC, LRR and PK domains) in resistant cultivars as compared to susceptible. This study has identified R-genes Pi-ta and Pi54 from durable indica resistant cultivars; Tetep and Tadukan, which can be used in marker assisted selection in rice breeding program.\nCONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of whole genome sequencing approach to characterize Indian rice germplasm. The genomic resources from our work will have a greater impact in understanding global rice diversity, genetics and molecular breeding.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Vascular wilt caused by Fusarium oxysporum is the most important disease in cape gooseberry (Physalis peruviana L.) in Colombia. The development of resistant cultivars is considered one of the most cost-effective means to reduce the impact of this disease. In order to do so, it is necessary to provide breeders with molecular markers and promising germplasm for introgression of different resistance loci as part of breeding schemes. Here we described an association mapping study in cape gooseberry with the goal to: (i) select promising materials for use in plant breeding and (ii) identify SNPs associated with the cape gooseberry resistance response to the F. oxysporum pathogen under greenhouse conditions, as potential markers for cape gooseberry breeding.\nRESULTS: We found a total of 21 accessions with different resistance responses within a diversity panel of 100 cape gooseberry accessions. A total of 60,663 SNPs were also identified within the same panel by means of GBS (Genotyping By Sequencing). Model-based population structure and neighbor-joining analyses showed three populations comprising the cape gooseberry panel. After correction for population structure and kinship, we identified SNPs markers associated with the resistance response against F. oxysporum. The identification of markers was based on common tags using the reference genomes of tomato and potato as well as the root/stem transcriptome of cape gooseberry. By comparing their location with the tomato genome, 16 SNPs were found in genes involved in defense/resistance response to pathogens, likewise when compared with the genome of potato, 12 markers were related.\nCONCLUSIONS: The work presented herein provides the first association mapping study in cape gooseberry showing both the identification of promising accessions with resistance response phenotypes and the identification of a set of SNP markers mapped to defense/resistance response genes of reference genomes. Thus, the work also provides new knowledge on candidate genes involved in the P. peruviana - F. oxysporum pathosystem as a foundation for further validation in marker-assisted selection. The results have important implications for conservation and breeding strategies in cape gooseberry.",

Along the continuum of universal antenatal and delivery care, neonatal medicine becomes a normative part of reproductive health care in Chiang Mai. As the NICU opens its door to sick newborns whose belonging to kinship and the nation-state is uncertain, neonatal care requires deliberate practices to incorporate them into life-sustaining connections. By tracing medical staff's effort to be accountable to their fragile patients, I show that withdrawing of intensive care is relational work that requires affective involvement and distancing through commensality, prosthetic extensions, and karmic network. This specific mode of care, which is premised on the combination of unconditional openness and careful detachment, offers insight into a possible enactment of hospitality within biomedical institutions.",

By mutant screening, we showed a knock-out mutant of fabR, encoding a repressor of unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis (UFA), to have impaired biofilm formation. In order to unravel how this regulator impinges on Salmonella biofilm formation, we aimed at elucidating the S. Typhimurium FabR regulon. Hereto, we applied a combinatorial high-throughput approach, combining ChIP-chip with transcriptomics.\nRESULTS: All the previously identified E. coli FabR transcriptional target genes (fabA, fabB and yqfA) were shown to be direct S. Typhimurium FabR targets as well. As we found a fabB overexpressing strain to partly mimic the biofilm defect of the fabR mutant, the effect of FabR on biofilms can be attributed at least partly to FabB, which plays a key role in UFA biosynthesis. Additionally, ChIP-chip identified a number of novel direct FabR targets (the intergenic regions between hpaR/hpaG and ddg/ydfZ) and yet putative direct targets (i.a. genes involved in tRNA metabolism, ribosome synthesis and translation). Next to UFA biosynthesis, a number of these direct targets and other indirect targets identified by transcriptomics (e.g. ribosomal genes, ompA, ompC, ompX, osmB, osmC, sseI), could possibly contribute to the effect of FabR on biofilm formation.\nCONCLUSION: Overall, our results point at the importance of FabR and UFA biosynthesis in Salmonella biofilm formation and their role as potential targets for biofilm inhibitory strategies.",

MYB proteins are involved in plant development, abiotic stress tolerance, hormone signal transduction and disease resistance. Here we perform genome-wide identification of MYB family transcription factors in an energy plant J. curcas, including determining family composition, phylogenetic evolution and functional prediction analysis. In addition, we further elucidate the function of the JcMYB2 gene.\nMETHODS: The phylogenetic trees were constructed by using the neighbor-joining method in MEGA 5.2. The biological functions of some JcMYBs were predicted according to orthology. The full length cDNA of JcMYB2 was cloned by using the RACE method. GUS histochemical staining was used to test the activity of the JcMYB2 promoter. Expression patterns of JcMYB2 were detected by using qPCR Transcriptional activity JcMYB2 were confirmed through yeast one hybrid. Subcellular Localization of JcMYB2 Protein were demonstrated by transient expression in the tobacco leaf. The function of JcMYB2 in salt and freezing tolerance were detected in transgenic plants.\nRESULTS: A genome-wide analysis identified 128 MYB genes, including 123 R2R3-MYBs, 4 R1R2R3-MYBs and 1 4R-MYB. All of the R2R3-MYBs are further classified into 19 groups which indicated functional conservation among previously identified groups of R2R3-MYB proteins. Among of these newly identified MYBs, the JcMYB2 belongs to group G11 and its expression is induced obviously by cold, salt and MeJA (Methyl Jasmonate) and slightly by ABA (abscisic acid). JcMYB2 is localized to the nucleus and has transcriptional activity. JcMYB2 overexpressing plants are more tolerant to salt and cold stress than wild type plants. Tissue specific expression profiles showed that the JcMYB2 gene was expressed ubiquitously throughout the plant, with higher expression levels observed in the root.\nCONCLUSION: A comprehensive genome-wide analysis and phylogenetic relationship of R2R3-MYB subfamily in J. curcas present the global identification and functional prediction of JcR2R3-MYBs. Additionally, JcMYB2 regulates the stress response signaling networks by interacting with MeJA and ABA signaling pathway and functions in the root development of J. curcas.",

We have used this system to investigate the best way to screen mosaic Zebrafish founder individuals for germline transmission of induced mutations. Screening sperm samples from potential founders provides much better information on germline transmission rates and crucially the sequence of the particular insertions/deletions (indels) that will be transmitted. This enables us to combine screening with archiving to create a library of cryopreserved samples carrying known mutations. It also allows us to design efficient genotyping assays, making identifying F1 carriers straightforward.\nCONCLUSIONS: The methods described will streamline the production of large numbers of knockout alleles in selected genes for phenotypic analysis, complementing existing efforts using random mutagenesis.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: We have previously found substantial animal-to-animal and age-dependent variation in the response of Holstein fibroblast cultures challenged with LPS. To expand on this finding, fibroblast cultures were established from dairy (Holstein) and beef (Angus) cattle and challenged with LPS to examine breed-dependent differences in the innate immune response. Global gene expression was measured by RNA-Seq, while an epigenetic basis for expression differences was examined by methylated CpG island recovery assay sequencing (MIRA-Seq) analysis.\nRESULTS: The Holstein breed displayed a more robust response to LPS than the Angus breed based on RNA-Seq analysis of cultures challenged with LPS for 0, 2, and 8 h. Several immune-associated genes were expressed at greater levels (FDR < 0.05) in Holstein cultures including TLR4 at all time points and a number of pro-inflammatory genes such as IL8, CCL20, CCL5, and TNF following LPS exposure. Despite extensive breed differences in the transcriptome, MIRA-Seq unveiled relatively similar patterns of genome-wide DNA methylation between breeds, with an overall hypomethylation of gene promoters. However, by examining the genome in 3Kb windows, 49 regions of differential methylation were discovered between Holstein and Angus fibroblasts, and two of these regions fell within the promoter region (-2500 to +500 bp of the transcription start site) of the genes NTRK2 and ADAMTS5.\nCONCLUSIONS: Fibroblasts isolated from Holstein cattle display a more robust response to LPS in comparison to cultures from Angus cattle. Different selection strategies and management practices exist between these two breeds that likely give rise to genetic and epigenetic factors contributing to the different immune response phenotypes.",

Part of this is explained by polymorphisms in genes encoding Tac-metabolizing enzymes and transporters.

Two recent randomized-controlled clinical trials using CYP3A5 genotype, however, did not show a decrease in acute rejections nor reduced toxicity. CYP3A4*22, CYP3A4*26, and POR*28 are also associated with Tac dose requirements and may be included to provide the expected improvement of Tac therapy. Studies focusing on the intracellular drug concentrations and on calcineurin inhibitor-induced nephrotoxicity also seem promising.

Three single nucleotide polymorphisms in transforming growth factor \u03b2-1, rs1800470; thrombospondin, type\u20091, domain-containing 7A, rs12673692; and formiminotransferase N-terminal subdomain-containing gene, rs7605378, showed a significant association with vertebral fracture prevalence, whereas five (\u03b1-l-iduronidase, rs3755955; C7orf58, rs190543052; homeobox C4, rs75256744; G\u2009patch domain-containing gene\u20091, rs2287679; and Werner syndrome, rs2230009) were significantly associated with femoral fracture. GRS values were calculated as the sum of risk allele counts (unweighted GRS) or of weighted scores estimated from logistic regression coefficients (weighted GRS). Both GRS values using the five single nucleotide polymorphisms adequately predicted femoral fracture prevalence for 924 male subjects; the areas under receiver-operating characteristic curves were 0.750 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.660-0.840) and 0.770 (95% CI 0.681-0.859), respectively. Logistic regression analysis showed that the odds ratio for the association between fracture prevalence and unweighted GRS \u22653 (n\u2009=\u2009124) was 8.39 (95% CI 4.22-16.69, P\u2009<\u20090.001) relative to GRS\u2009<\u20093 (n\u2009=\u2009797).

In plants, CNVs of several genes were found to be responsible for various important traits; however, the cause and consequence of CNVs remains largely unknown. Recently released next-generation sequencing (NGS) data provide an opportunity for a genome-wide study of CNVs in rice.\nRESULTS: Here, by an NGS-based approach, we generated a CNV map comprising 9,196 deletions compared to the reference genome 'Nipponbare'. Using Oryza glaberrima as the outgroup, 80% of the CNV events turned out to be insertions in Nipponbare. There were 2,806 annotated genes affected by these CNV events. We experimentally validated 28 functional CNV genes including OsMADS56, BPH14, OsDCL2b and OsMADS30, implying that CNVs might have contributed to phenotypic variations in rice. Most CNV genes were found to be located in non-co-linear positions by comparison to O. glaberrima. One of the origins of these non-co-linear genes was genomic duplications caused by transposon activity or double-strand break repair. Comprehensive analysis of mutation mechanisms suggested an abundance of CNVs formed by non-homologous end-joining and mobile element insertion.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study showed the impact and origin of copy number variations in rice on a genomic scale.",

These may provide another source of features for multivariate predictive modeling of disease phenotype for the prioritization of candidate biomarkers. The continuous nature of SNV allele fraction features allows the concurrent investigation of several genomic phenomena, including allele specific expression, clonal expansion and/or deletion, and copy number variation.\nRESULTS: The proposed software pipeline and package, SNV Discriminant Analysis (SNV-DA), was applied on two RNA-Seq datasets with varying sample sizes sequenced at different depths: a dataset containing primary tumors from twenty patients with different disease outcomes in lung adenocarcinoma and a larger dataset of primary tumors representing two major breast cancer subtypes, estrogen receptor positive and triple negative. Predictive models were generated using the machine learning algorithm, sparse projections to latent structures discriminant analysis. Training sets composed of RNA-Seq SNV features limited to genomic regions of origin (e.g. exonic or intronic) and/or RNA-editing sites were shown to produce models with accurate predictive performances, were discriminant towards true label groupings, and were able to produce SNV rankings significantly different from than univariate tests. Furthermore, the utility of the proposed methodology is supported by its comparable performance to traditional models as well as the enrichment of selected SNVs located in genes previously associated with cancer and genes showing allele-specific expression. As proof of concept, we highlight the discovery of a previously unannotated intergenic locus that is associated with epigenetic regulatory marks in cancer and whose significant allele-specific expression is correlated with ER+ status; hereafter named ER+ associated hotspot (ERPAHS).\nCONCLUSION: The use of models from RNA-Seq SNVs to identify and prioritize candidate molecular targets for biomarker discovery is supported by the ability of the proposed method to produce significantly accurate predictive models that are discriminant towards true label groupings. Importantly, the proposed methodology allows investigation of mutations outside of exonic regions and identification of interesting expressed loci not included in traditional gene annotations. An implementation of the proposed methodology is provided that allows the user to specify SNV filtering criteria and cross-validation design during model creation and evaluation.",

We detected frequent mutations, high expression and high copy number variations of certain genes in both drug resistant cell lines and sensitive cell lines. It was observed that a few drugs, like Panobinostat, are effective against almost all types of cell lines, whereas certain drugs are effective against only a limited type of cell lines. Tissue-specific preference of drugs was also seen where a drug is more effective against cell lines belonging to a specific tissue.

        "abstract": "AIM: A randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted to test the null hypothesis that there is no difference in complication rates and length of stay (LOS)\u00a0between laparoscopic right colectomy (LRC) and laparoscopic-assisted colonoscopic polypectomy (LACP) for endoscopically unresectable polyps of the right colon.\nMETHOD: A single-centre RCT (NCT01986699) was conducted on patients with polyps of the right colon deemed by\u00a0the gastroenterologist to be unresectable. Patients underwent a repeat colonoscopy with biopsy by an interventional endoscopist and\u00a0were allocated to LRC or LACP. Patients with a nonlift sign,\u00a0dysplasia, adenocarcinoma, inflammatory bowel disease or familial adenomatous polyposis\u00a0were excluded from the trial. The study was powered to detect a 73% difference in the LOS\u00a0which required 17 patients in each\u00a0arm with an\u00a0\u03b1 error of 0.05 and a power of\u00a095%.\nRESULTS: Thirty-four patients were comparable for age (P\u00a0=\u00a00.919), gender (P\u00a0=\u00a00.364), body mass index (P\u00a0=\u00a00.634), American Society of Anesthesiologists class\u00a0(P\u00a0=\u00a00.388) and previous abdominal surgery (P\u00a0=\u00a00.366).

LRC patients experienced a longer operating time (180 vs 90\u00a0min; P\u00a0=\u00a00.001), required more intravenous infusion (3.1 vs 2.0\u00a0l; P\u00a0=\u00a00.025), took significantly longer to pass flatus (2.88 vs 1.44\u00a0days; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), resumed solid food later (3.94 vs 1.69\u00a0days; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and had a longer postoperative LOS (4.94 vs 2.63\u00a0days; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Postoperative complications (P\u00a0=\u00a00.656), readmissions (P\u00a0=\u00a00.5) and reoperations (P\u00a0=\u00a00.5) did not differ. Final size (P\u00a0=\u00a00.339) and histology (P\u00a0=\u00a00.104) of the polyps did not differ. There were four cancers in the LRC arm. At follow-up colonoscopy with biopsy of the scar in 10 patients at 15.3\u00a0months, one patient had recurrence of the polyp at the site of the previous LACP.\nCONCLUSION: LACP and LRC had similar complication rates, but LOS\u00a0was shorter after LACP.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Changes in the tumor microenvironment and immune surveillance represent crucial hallmarks of various kinds of cancer, including oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), and a close crosstalk of hypoxia regulating genes, an activation of chemokines and immune cells has been described.\nMETHODS: A review about the pivotal role of HIF-1, its crosstalk to various cornerstones in OSCC tumorigenesis is presented.\nRESULTS: Hypoxia is a frequent event in OSCC and leads to a reprogramming of the cellular metabolism in order to prevent cell death. Hypoxic OSCC cells induce different adaptive changes such as anaerobic glycolysis, pH stabilisation and alterations of the gene and protein expression profile. This complex metabolic program is orchestrated by the hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1, the master regulator of early tumor progression. Hypoxia-dependent and -independent alterations in immune surveillance lead to different immune evasion strategies, which are partially mediated by alterations of the tumor cells, changes in the frequency, activity and repertoire of immune cell infiltrates and of soluble and environmental factors of the tumor micromilieu with consecutive generation of an immune escape phenotype, progression of disease and poor clinical outcome of OSCC patients.\nCONCLUSIONS: This review focusses on the importance of HIF-1 in the adaption and reprogramming of the metabolic system to reduced oxygen values as well as on the role of the tumor microenvironment for evasion of OSCC from immune recognition and destruction.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: American Heart Association (AHA) public policy advocacy strategies are based on its Strategic Impact Goals. The writing group appraised the evidence behind AHA's policies to determine how well they address the association's 2020 cardiovascular health (CVH) metrics and cardiovascular disease (CVD) management indicators and identified research needed to fill gaps in policy and support further policy development.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: The AHA policy research department first identified current AHA policies specific to each CVH metric and CVD management indicator and the evidence underlying each policy. Writing group members then reviewed each policy and the related metrics and indicators. The results of each review were summarized, and topic-specific priorities and overarching themes for future policy research were proposed. There was generally close alignment between current AHA policies and the 2020 CVH metrics and CVD management indicators; however, certain specific policies still lack a robust evidence base. For CVH metrics, the distinction between policies for adults (age \u226520 years) and children (<20 years) was often not considered, although policy approaches may differ importantly by age. Inclusion of all those <20 years of age as a single group also ignores important differences in policy needs for infants, children, adolescents, and young adults. For CVD management indicators, specific quantitative targets analogous to criteria for ideal, intermediate, and poor CVH are lacking but needed to assess progress toward the 2020 goal to reduce deaths from CVDs and stroke. New research in support of current policies needs to focus on the evaluation of their translation and implementation through expanded application of implementation science. Focused basic, clinical, and population research is required to expand and strengthen the evidence base for the development of new policies. Evaluation of the impact of targeted improvements in population health through strengthened surveillance of CVD and stroke events, determination of the cost-effectiveness of policy interventions, and measurement of the extent to which vulnerable populations are reached must be assessed for all policies. Additional attention should be paid to the social determinants of health outcomes.\nCONCLUSIONS: AHA's public policies are generally robust and well aligned with its 2020 CVH metrics and CVD indicators. Areas for further policy development to fill gaps, overarching research strategies, and topic-specific priority areas are proposed.",

        "abstract": "Childhood stressors including physical abuse predict adult cancer risk. Prior research portrays this finding as an indirect mechanism that operates through coping behaviors, including adult smoking, or through increased toxic exposures during childhood. Little is known about potential direct causal mechanisms between early-life stressors and adult cancer. Because prenatal conditions can affect gene expression by altering DNA methylation, with implications for adult health, we hypothesize that maternal stress may program methylation of cancer-linked genes during gametogenesis. To illustrate this hypothesis, we related maternal social resources to methylation at the imprinted MEG3 differentially methylated regulatory region, which has been linked to multiple cancer types. Mothers (n\u00a0=\u00a0489) from a diverse birth cohort (Durham, North Carolina) provided newborns' cord blood and completed a questionnaire. Newborns of currently married mothers showed lower (-0.321 SD, p\u00a0<\u00a0.05) methylation compared to newborns of never-married mothers, who did not differ from newborns whose mothers were cohabiting and others (adjusted for demographics). MEG3 DNA methylation levels were also lower when maternal grandmothers co-resided before pregnancy (-0.314 SD, p\u00a0<\u00a0.05). A 1-SD increase in prenatal neighborhood disadvantage also predicted higher methylation (-0.137 SD, p\u00a0<\u00a0.05). In conclusion, we found that maternal social resources may result in differential methylation of MEG3, which demonstrates a potential partial mechanism priming socially disadvantaged newborns for later risk of some cancers.",

We evaluated cardiac functions using conventional tissue Doppler and two-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography in patients with DS in the absence of congenital and acquired heart disease in patients.\nMETHODS: A total of 115 patients with DS between 6 and 13 years of age with clinically and anatomically normal heart and 55 healthy children were included in this cross-sectional study. DS was diagnosed by a karyotype test. Patients with mosaic type were not included in this study. Systolic and diastolic functions were evaluated by echocardiography.\nRESULTS: Pulsed waved Doppler transmitral early/late inflow velocity (E/A), tissue Doppler mitral annular early/late diastolic peak velocity (Ea/Aa), transtricuspid E/A and tricuspid valve annulus Ea/Aa, pulmonary venous Doppler systolic/diastolic (S/D) wave ratio were lower in patients with Down syndrome than in the control group (P=0.04, P=0.001, P<0.05, P<0.001, P<0.001, respectively). Mitral and tricuspid annular Ea were lower in patients with DS (P<0.001). The right and left ventricular myocardial performance indexes were higher in patients with DS than in the controls (P<0.01). They had significantly higher left ventricular mass, ejection fraction, the mitral annular plane systolic excursion values. However, the Down syndrome group compared with the controls had a lower strain values examined by two-dimensional longitudinal speckle-tracking strain echocardiography.\nCONCLUSION: These findings suggest conventional tissue Doppler and two-dimensional longitudinal speckletracking strain echocardiography were useful methods of investigating ventricular function and identifying a higher incidence of biventricular dysfunction in patients with Down syndrome compared with the healthy controls.",

        "abstract": "The clinical usefulness of assessing the enzymatic activity of CYPD6 in patients taking tamoxifen had been longly debated. In favour of preemptive evaluation of phenotypic profile of patients is the strong pharmacologic rationale, being that the formation of endoxifen, the major and clinically most important metabolite of tamoxifen, is largely dependent on the activity of CYP2D6. This enzyme is highly polymorphic for which the activity is largely depending on genetics, but that can also be inhibited by a number of drugs, i.e. antidepressants, which are frequently used in patients with cancer. Unfortunately, the clinical trials that have been published in the last years are contradicting each other on the association between CYP2D6 and significant clinical endpoints, and for this reason CYP2D6 genotyping is at present not generally recommended. Despite this, the CYP2D6 genotyping test for tamoxifen is available in many laboratories and it may still be an appropriate test to use it in specific cases.",

        "abstract": "Recent large-scale genomic studies have classified medulloblastoma into four subtypes: Wnt, Shh, Group 3 and Group 4. Each is characterized by specific mutations and distinct epigenetic states. Previously, we showed that a chromatin regulator SMARCA4/Brg1 is required for Gli-mediated transcription activation in Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling. We report here that Brg1 controls a transcriptional program that specifically regulates Shh-type medulloblastoma growth. Using a mouse model of Shh-type medulloblastoma, we deleted Brg1 in precancerous progenitors and primary or transplanted tumors. Brg1 deletion significantly inhibited tumor formation and progression. Genome-wide expression analyses and binding experiments indicate that Brg1 specifically coordinates with key transcription factors including Gli1, Atoh1 and REST to regulate the expression of both oncogenes and tumor suppressors that are required for medulloblastoma identity and proliferation. Shh-type medulloblastoma displays distinct H3K27me3 properties. We demonstrate that Brg1 modulates activities of H3K27me3 modifiers to regulate the expression of medulloblastoma genes. Brg1-regulated pathways are conserved in human Shh-type medulloblastoma, and Brg1 is important for the growth of a human medulloblastoma cell line. Thus, Brg1 coordinates a genetic and epigenetic network that regulates the transcriptional program underlying the Shh-type medulloblastoma development.",

Discriminatory accuracy was measured by area under ROC curve (AUC). For risk evaluation, we divided individuals according to positive and negative likelihood ratios (LR) of a test, with LR > 5 for high risk group and LR < 0.20 for low risk group.\nRESULTS: The highest accuracy, AUC of 0.78 was achieved with GRS combining 33 SNPs with optimal sensitivity and specificity of 75.0% and 72.7%, respectively. Individuals with the highest risk (GRS > 5.54) showed significantly increased odds of developing CD (OR = 26.65, 95%CI: 11.25-63.15) compared to the individuals with the lowest risk (GRS < 4.57) which is a considerably greater risk captured than in one SNP with the highest effect size (OR = 3.24). When more than 33 SNPs were included in GRS, discriminatory ability was not improved significantly; AUC of all 74 SNPs was 0.76.\nCONCLUSION: The authors proved the possibility of building accurate genetic risk score based on 33 risk variants on Slovenian CD patients which may serve as a screening tool in the targeted population.",

The clinical validity of various PCa risk assessment methods utilizing single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) has been established; however, these SNP-based methods have not been compared. The objective of this study was to compare the three most commonly used SNP-based methods for PCa risk assessment. Participants were men (n = 1654) enrolled in a prospective study of PCa development. Genotypes of 59 PCa risk-associated SNPs were available in this cohort. Three methods of calculating SNP-based genetic risk scores (GRSs) were used for the evaluation of individual disease risk such as risk allele count (GRS-RAC), weighted risk allele count (GRS-wRAC), and population-standardized genetic risk score (GRS-PS). Mean GRSs were calculated, and performances were compared using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and positive predictive value (PPV). All SNP-based methods were found to be independently associated with PCa (all P < 0.05; hence their clinical validity). The mean GRSs in men with or without PCa using GRS-RAC were 55.15 and 53.46, respectively, using GRS-wRAC were 7.42 and 6.97, respectively, and using GRS-PS were 1.12 and 0.84, respectively (all P < 0.05 for differences between patients with or without PCa). All three SNP-based methods performed similarly in discriminating PCa from non-PCa based on AUC and in predicting PCa risk based on PPV (all P > 0.05 for comparisons between the three methods), and all three SNP-based methods had a significantly higher AUC than family history (all P < 0.05). Results from this study suggest that while the three most commonly used SNP-based methods performed similarly in discriminating PCa from non-PCa at the population level, GRS-PS is the method of choice for risk assessment at the individual level because its value (where 1.0 represents average population risk) can be easily interpreted regardless of the number of risk-associated SNPs used in the calculation.",

Ischemic stroke events were defined as the outcomes of the study. All the 2 589 participants were categorized into four subgroups: without family history of cardiovascular disease/nonsmokers, without family history of cardiovascular disease/smokers, with family history of cardiovascular disease/nonsmokers and with family history of cardiovascular disease/smokers, according to family history of cardiovascular disease and smoking status. Cumlative incidence rates of events among the four subgroups was described with Kaplan-Meier curves. Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) of ischemic stroke events among the four subgroups.\nRESULTS: Data from the Kaplan-Meier curves showed that the cumulative incidence rates of ischemic stroke were 1.17% (15/1 278), 3.83% (37/967), 5.70% (9/158) and 8.33% (15/180) for the groups of no family history of cardiovascular disease/nonsmokers, no family history of cardiovascular disease/smokers, with family history of cardiovascular disease/nonsmokers and with family history of cardiovascular disease/smokers, respectively.

This article summarizes our findings, suggests applications to risk assessment, and identifies strategic research directions.\nOBJECTIVE: Our specific objectives were to test whether advanced biological data and methods could better inform our understanding of public health risks posed by environmental exposures.\nMETHODS: New data and methods were applied and evaluated for use in hazard identification and dose-response assessment. Biomarkers of exposure and effect, and risk characterization were also examined. Consideration was given to various decision contexts with increasing regulatory and public health impacts. Data types included transcriptomics, genomics, and proteomics. Methods included molecular epidemiology and clinical studies, bioinformatic knowledge mining, pathway and network analyses, short-duration in vivo and in vitro bioassays, and quantitative structure activity relationship modeling.\nDISCUSSION: NexGen has advanced our ability to apply new science by more rapidly identifying chemicals and exposures of potential concern, helping characterize mechanisms of action that influence conclusions about causality, exposure-response relationships, susceptibility and cumulative risk, and by elucidating new biomarkers of exposure and effects. Additionally, NexGen has fostered extensive discussion among risk scientists and managers and improved confidence in interpreting and applying new data streams.\nCONCLUSIONS: While considerable uncertainties remain, thoughtful application of new knowledge to risk assessment appears reasonable for augmenting major scope assessments, forming the basis for or augmenting limited scope assessments, and for prioritization and screening of very data limited chemicals.

Except for a targeted molecular genotyping approach, there is no distinct clinical or laboratory phenotype that has been specifically associated with this particular gene mutation. Such heterogeneity could be due to variations in mutation and genetic background in different families. To understand the phenotypic heterogeneity, we thoroughly studied one affected family using the International Society for Thrombosis and Haemostasis bleeding assessment tool and both clinically validated standard and esoteric platelet testing (electron microscopy (EM) and flow cytometry). We found that decreased platelet aggregation with arachidonic acid and epinephrine agonists was common in affected family members. EM studies demonstrated persistent borderline low mean dense granules per platelet, decreased alpha granules and an increased canalicular network pattern in all affected members. Since these characteristics are subtle or non-pathognomonic, molecular testing for ANKRD26 mutation remains the most reliable test to render a diagnosis and should be considered when evaluating a patient or family with congenital thrombocytopenia, particularly if there is a history of myeloid neoplasms.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Gelsolin amyloidosis (AGel), also known as familial amyloidosis, Finnish type (FAF), is an autosomal, dominant, incurable disease caused by a point mutation (G654A/T) in the gelsolin (GSN) gene. The mutation results in loss of a Ca2+-binding site in the second gelsolin domain. Subsequent incorrect folding exposes a cryptic furin cleavage site, leading to the formation of a 68-kDa C-terminal cleavage product (C68) in the trans-Golgi network. This C68 fragment is cleaved by membrane type 1-matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) during secretion into the extracellular environment, releasing 8- and 5-kDa amyloidogenic peptides. These peptides aggregate and cause disease-associated symptoms. We set out to investigate whether AGel-specific nanobodies could be used to monitor amyloidogenic gelsolin buildup.\nPROCEDURES: Three nanobodies (FAF Nb1-3) raised against the 8-kDa fragment were screened as AGel amyloid imaging agents in WT and AGel mice using 99mTc-based single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/X-ray tomography (CT), biodistribution analysis, and immunofluorescence (IF). The quantitative characteristics were analyzed in a follow-up study with a Nb11-expressing mouse model.\nRESULTS: All three nanobodies possess the characteristics desired for a\u00a099mTc-based SPECT/CT imaging agent, high specificity and a low background signal. FAF Nb1 was identified as the most potent, based on its superior signal-to-noise ratio and signal specificity. As a proof of concept, we implemented 99mTc-FAF Nb1 in a follow-up study of the Nb11-expressing AGel mouse model. Using biodistribution analysis and immunofluorescence, we demonstrated the validity of the data acquired via 99mTc-FAF Nb1 SPECT/CT.\nCONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate the potential of this nanobody as a non-invasive tool to image amyloidogenic gelsolin deposition and assess the therapeutic capacity of AGel therapeutics currently under development. We propose that this approach can be extended to other amyloid diseases, thereby contributing to the development of specific therapies.",

        "abstract": "The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) network study of 12 cancer types (PanCancer 12) revealed frequent mutation of TP53, and amplification and expression of related TP63 isoform \u0394Np63 in squamous cancers. Further, aberrant expression of inflammatory genes and TP53/p63/p73 targets were detected in the PanCancer 12 project, reminiscent of gene programs comodulated by cREL/\u0394Np63/TAp73 transcription factors we uncovered in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs). However, how inflammatory gene signatures and cREL/p63/p73 targets are comodulated genome wide is unclear. Here, we examined how the inflammatory factor tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) broadly modulates redistribution of cREL with \u0394Np63\u03b1/TAp73 complexes and signatures genome wide in the HNSCC model UM-SCC46 using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq). TNF-\u03b1 enhanced genome-wide co-occupancy of cREL with \u0394Np63\u03b1 on TP53/p63 sites, while unexpectedly promoting redistribution of TAp73 from TP53 to activator protein-1 (AP-1) sites. cREL, \u0394Np63\u03b1 and TAp73 binding and oligomerization on NF-\u03baB-, TP53- or AP-1-specific sequences were independently validated by ChIP-qPCR (quantitative PCR), oligonucleotide-binding assays and analytical ultracentrifugation. Function of the binding activity was confirmed using TP53-, AP-1- and NF-\u03baB-specific REs or p21, SERPINE1 and IL-6 promoter luciferase reporter activities. Concurrently, TNF-\u03b1 regulated a broad gene network with cobinding activities for cREL, \u0394Np63\u03b1 and TAp73 observed upon array profiling and reverse transcription-PCR. Overlapping target gene signatures were observed in squamous cancer subsets and in inflamed skin of transgenic mice overexpressing \u0394Np63\u03b1. Furthermore, multiple target genes identified in this study were linked to TP63 and TP73 activity and increased gene expression in large squamous cancer samples from PanCancer 12 TCGA by CircleMap. PARADIGM inferred pathway analysis revealed the network connection of TP63 and NF-\u03baB complexes through an AP-1 hub, further supporting our findings. Thus, inflammatory cytokine TNF-\u03b1 mediates genome-wide redistribution of the cREL/p63/p73, and AP-1 interactome, to diminish TAp73 tumor suppressor function and reciprocally activate NF-\u03baB and AP-1 gene programs implicated in malignancy.",

        "abstract": "We evaluated the frequency, genetic architecture, clinico-pathologic features and prognostic impact of RUNX1 mutations in 2439 adult patients with newly-diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML). RUNX1 mutations were found in 245 of 2439 (10%) patients; were almost mutually exclusive of AML with recurrent genetic abnormalities; and they co-occurred with a complex pattern of gene mutations, frequently involving mutations in epigenetic modifiers (ASXL1, IDH2, KMT2A, EZH2), components of the spliceosome complex (SRSF2, SF3B1) and STAG2, PHF6, BCOR. RUNX1 mutations were associated with older age (16-59 years: 8.5%; \u2a7e60 years: 15.1%), male gender, more immature morphology and secondary AML evolving from myelodysplastic syndrome. In univariable analyses, RUNX1 mutations were associated with inferior event-free (EFS, P&lt;0.0001), relapse-free (RFS, P=0.0007) and overall survival (OS, P&lt;0.0001) in all patients, remaining significant when age was considered. In multivariable analysis, RUNX1 mutations predicted for inferior EFS (P=0.01). The effect of co-mutation varied by partner gene, where patients with the secondary genotypes RUNX1mut/ASXL1mut (OS, P=0.004), RUNX1mut/SRSF2mut (OS, P=0.007) and RUNX1mut/PHF6mut (OS, P=0.03) did significantly worse, whereas patients with the genotype RUNX1mut/IDH2mut (OS, P=0.04) had a better outcome. In conclusion, RUNX1-mutated AML is associated with a complex mutation cluster and is correlated with distinct clinico-pathologic features and inferior prognosis.",

        "abstract": "The divalent cation zinc is associated with cortical plasticity. However, the mechanism of zinc in the pathophysiology of cortical injury-associated neurobehavioral damage following neonatal seizures is uncertain. We have previously shown upregulated expression of ZnT-3; MT-3 in hippocampus of neonatal rats submitted to flurothyl-induced recurrent seizures, which was restored by pretreatment with ketogenic diet (KD). In this study, utilizing a novel \"twist\" seizure model by coupling early-life flurothyl-induced seizures with later exposure to penicillin, we further investigated the long-term effects of KD on cortical expression of zinc homeostasis-related genes in a systemic scale. Ten Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned each averagely into the non-seizure plus normal diet (NS\u00a0+\u00a0ND), non-seizure plus KD (NS\u00a0+\u00a0KD), recurrent seizures plus normal diet (RS\u00a0+\u00a0ND) and recurrent seizures plus KD (RS\u00a0+\u00a0KD) group. Recurrent seizures were induced by volatile flurothyl during P9-P21. During P23-P53, rats in NS\u00a0+\u00a0KD and RS\u00a0+\u00a0KD groups were dieted with KD. Neurological behavioral parameters of brain damage (plane righting reflex, cliff avoidance reflex, and open field test) were observed at P43. At P63, we examined seizure threshold using penicillin, then the cerebral cortex were evaluated for real-time RT-PCR and western blot study. The RS\u00a0+\u00a0ND group showed worse performances in neurological reflex tests and reduced latencies to myoclonic seizures induced by penicillin compared with the control, which was concomitant with altered expressions of ZnT-7, MT-1, MT-2, and ZIP7. Specifically, there was long-term elevated expression of ZIP7 in RS\u00a0+\u00a0ND group compared with that in NS\u00a0+\u00a0ND that was restored by chronic ketogenic diet (KD) treatment in RS\u00a0+\u00a0KD group, which was quite in parallel with the above neurobehavioral changes. Taken together, these findings indicate that the long-term altered expression of the metal transporter ZIP7 in adult cerebral cortex might correlate with neurobehavioral damage and reduced seizure threshold following recurrent neonate seizures and further highlights ZIP7 as a candidate for therapeutic target of KD for the treatment of neonatal seizure-induced long-term brain damage.",

This is often easy to recognise particularly in the presence of an autosomal dominant history. Whilst HD may be the most common aetiology of such a presentation, several HD phenocopies should be considered if genetic testing for HD is negative. We searched PubMed and the Cochrane Database from January 1, 1946 up to January 1, 2016, combining the search terms: 'chorea', 'Huntington's disease', 'HDL' and 'phenocopies'. HD phenocopies frequently display additional movement disorders such as myoclonus, dystonia, parkinsonism and tics. Here, we discuss the phenotypes, and investigations of HD-like disorders where the combination of progressive chorea and cognitive impairment is obvious, but HD gene test result is negative. Conditions presenting with sudden onset chorea such as vascular, infectious and autoimmune causes are not the primary focus of our discussion, but we will make a passing reference to these as some of these conditions are potentially treatable. Hereditary forms of chorea are a heterogeneous group of conditions and this number is increasing. While most of these conditions are not curable, molecular genetic testing has enabled many of these disorders to be distinguished from HD.

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Deregulated signaling via the MET receptor tyrosine kinase is abundant in gastric tumors, with up to 80% of cases displaying aberrant MET expression. A growing body of evidence suggests MET as a potential target for tumor radiosensitization.\nEXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Cellular proliferation and DNA damage-induced senescence were studied in a panel of MET-overexpressing human gastric cancer cell lines as well as in xenograft models after MET inhibition and/or ionizing radiation. Pathways activation and protein expression were assessed by immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry. Tumor tissue microarrays (91 gastric cancer patients) were generated and copy number alteration (178 patients) and gene expression (373 patients) data available at The Cancer Genome Atlas were analyzed to assess the coalterations of MET and FOXM1.\nRESULTS: MET targeting administered before ionizing radiation instigates DNA damage-induced senescence (\u223c80%, P < 0.001) rather than cell death. MET inhibition-associated senescence is linked to the blockade of MAPK pathway, correlates with downregulation of FOXM1, and can be abrogated (11.8% vs. 95.3%, P < 0.001) by ectopic expression of FOXM1 in the corresponding gastric tumor cells. Cells with ectopic FOXM1 expression demonstrate considerable (\u223c20%, P < 0.001) growth advantage despite MET targeting, suggesting a novel clinically relevant resistance mechanism to MET inhibition as the copresence of both MET and FOXM1 protein (33%) and mRNA (30%) overexpression as well as gene amplification (24,7%) are common in patients with gastric cancer.\nCONCLUSIONS: FOXM1, a negative regulator of senescence, has been identified as a key downstream effector and potential clinical biomarker that mediates MET signaling following infliction of DNA damage in gastric tumors.

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: The transcriptional regulation mediating cancer cell differentiation into distinct molecular subtypes and modulating sensitivity to existing treatments is an enticing therapeutic target. Our objective was to characterize the ability of the forkhead/winged transcription factor FOXP3 to modulate the differentiation of bladder cancer.\nEXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Expression of FOXP3 was analyzed by immunohistochemistry in a tumor microarray of 587 samples and overall survival in a subset of 187 patients following radical cystectomy. Functional assays were performed in SW780 and HT1376 cell lines in vitro and in vivo and gene expression profiling performed by RNA-Seq. Validation was undertaken using gene expression profiles of 131 patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) consortium in bladder cancer.\nRESULTS: FOXP3 expression correlates with bladder cancer stage and inversely with overall survival, with biased expression of the FOXP3\u03943 isoform. Functional assays of FOXP3\u03943 demonstrated resistance to chemotherapy in vitro, whereas subcutaneous xenografts overexpressing FOXP3\u03943 developed larger and more poorly differentiated bladder cancers. RNA expression profiling revealed a unique FOXP3\u03943 gene signature supporting a role in chemotherapy resistance. Accordingly, knockdown of Foxp3 by siRNA in HT1376 cells conferred sensitivity to cisplatin- and gemcitabine-induced cytotoxicity. Validation in TCGA dataset demonstrated increased expression of FOXP3 in subtypes II to IV and skewing of molecular subtypes based on FOXP3\u03943-specific gene expression.\nCONCLUSIONS: (i) Biased expression of the FOXP3\u03943 isoform in bladder cancer inversely correlates with overall survival, (ii) FOXP3\u03943 induces a unique gene program that mediates cancer differentiation, and (iii) FOXP3\u03943 may augment chemotherapy resistance.

To identify independent variables that affect frequency of BSE, nominal logistic regression analysis was performed.\nRESULTS: Of 417 women, 330 (79.3%) reported performing BSE.

The model is used to project the distribution of absolute risk for the population of white women in the United States after adjustment for competing cause of mortality.\nEXPOSURES: Single nucleotide polymorphisms, family history, anthropometric factors, menstrual and/or reproductive factors, and lifestyle factors.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Degree of stratification of absolute risk owing to nonmodifiable (SNPs, family history, height, and some components of menstrual and/or reproductive history) and modifiable factors (body mass index [BMI; calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared], menopausal hormone therapy [MHT], alcohol, and smoking).\nRESULTS: The average absolute risk for a 30-year-old white woman in the United States developing invasive breast cancer by age 80 years is 11.3%. A model that includes all risk factors provided a range of average absolute risk from 4.4% to 23.5% for women in the bottom and top deciles of the risk distribution, respectively. For women who were at the lowest and highest deciles of nonmodifiable risks, the 5th and 95th percentile range of the risk distribution associated with 4 modifiable factors was 2.9% to 5.0% and 15.5% to 25.0%, respectively. For women in the highest decile of risk owing to nonmodifiable factors, those who had low BMI, did not drink or smoke, and did not use MHT had risks comparable to an average woman in the general population.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This model for absolute risk of breast cancer including SNPs can provide stratification for the population of white women in the United States. The model can also identify subsets of the population at an elevated risk that would benefit most from risk-reduction strategies based on altering modifiable factors. The effectiveness of this model for individual risk communication needs further investigation.",

However, despite the significant success and specificity of this advocated targeted therapy, significant on- and off-target adverse effects and inter-individual variability in treatment responses have been reported. The interpatient variability in drug response has been suggested to be partly due to variations in patient genomes. Therefore, the identification of genetic biomarkers by conducting pharmacogenetics studies can help predict patient responses to targeted therapy and may serve as a basis for individualized treatment. In this review, both clinically established and potential molecular targets are highlighted. Overall, current literature suggests that individualization of targeted therapy is promising; however, integrating the clinical benefits of identified biomarkers into clinical practice for personalized medicine remains a major challenge, and further studies to validate these markers and identify novel therapeutic approaches are needed.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Standard models used to test gene-environment interaction (G\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0E) hypotheses make the causal assumption that there are no unobserved variables that could be biasing the interaction estimate. Whether this assumption can be met in nonexperimental studies is unclear because the interactive biological pathways from genetic polymorphisms and environments to behavior, and the confounders that can be introduced along these pathways, are often not delineated. This is problematic in the context of studies focused on caregiver-child dyads, in which common genes and environments induce gene-environment correlation. To address the impact of sources of bias in G\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0E models specifically assessing the interaction between child genotype and caregiver behavior, we provide a causal framework that integrates biological and statistical concepts of G\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0E, and assess the magnitude of bias introduced by various confounding pathways in different causal circumstances.\nMETHODS: A simulation assessed the magnitude of bias introduced by four types of confounding pathways in different causal models. Unadjusted and adjusted statistical models were then applied to the simulated data to assess the efficacy of these procedures to capture unbiased G\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0E estimates. Finally, the simulation was run under null effects of the genotype to assess the impact of biasing sources on the false-positive rate.\nRESULTS: Common environmental pathways between caregiver and child inflated G\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0E estimates and raised the false-positive rate. Evocative effects of the child also inflated G\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0E estimates.\nCONCLUSIONS: Gene-environment interaction studies should be approached with consideration to the causal pathways at play and the confounding opportunities along these pathways to facilitate the inclusion of adequate statistical controls and correct inferences from study findings. Bridging biological and statistical concepts of G\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0E can significantly improve research design and the communication of how a G\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0E process fits into a broader developmental framework.",

        "abstract": "Neonatal haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a rare but potentially lethal condition. We recently encountered a preterm infant who developed severe HLH associated with maternal adult-onset Still's disease, which to our knowledge has not been previously reported. The infant presented with fever, generalised lymphadenopathy, transient erythematous skin rash, hepatosplenomegaly, ascites, pancytopenia, marked hyperferritinaemia, and hypofibrinogenaemia, which were features similar to maternal presentation during late pregnancy. Whole gene exome sequencing screening for familial HLH (PRF1, STX11, STXBP2, and MUNC13D genes) was negative. We postulated that factors such as auto-antibodies, antigens, or inflammatory mediators transmitted vertically from the mother could have triggered the intense inflammation in the infant. The infant responded promptly to dexamethasone, etoposide, and cyclosporin A, without the need for bone marrow transplantation. Neonatologists should be alerted to the rare diagnosis of HLH in the presence of active maternal diseases, including infection or autoimmune conditions, especially in association with fever, cytopenia, and hepatosplenomegaly.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Falsified medicines are deliberately fraudulent drugs that pose a direct risk to patient health and undermine healthcare systems, causing global morbidity and mortality.\nOBJECTIVE: To produce an overview of anti-falsifying public health interventions deployed at international, national and local scales in low and middle income countries (LMIC).\nDATA SOURCES: We conducted a systematic search of the PubMed, Web of Science, Embase and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases for healthcare or pharmaceutical policies relevant to reducing the burden of falsified medicines in LMIC.\nRESULTS: Our initial search identified 660 unique studies, of which 203 met title/abstract inclusion criteria and were categorised according to their primary focus: international; national; local pharmacy; internet pharmacy; drug analysis tools. Eighty-four were included in the qualitative synthesis, along with 108 articles and website links retrieved through secondary searches.\nDISCUSSION: On the international stage, we discuss the need for accessible pharmacovigilance (PV) global reporting systems, international leadership and funding incorporating multiple stakeholders (healthcare, pharmaceutical, law enforcement) and multilateral trade agreements that emphasise public health. On the national level, we explore the importance of establishing adequate medicine regulatory authorities and PV capacity, with drug screening along the supply chain. This requires interdepartmental coordination, drug certification and criminal justice legislation and enforcement that recognise the severity of medicine falsification. Local healthcare professionals can receive training on medicine quality assessments, drug registration and pharmacological testing equipment. Finally, we discuss novel technologies for drug analysis which allow rapid identification of fake medicines in low-resource settings. Innovative point-of-purchase systems like mobile phone verification allow consumers to check the authenticity of their medicines.\nCONCLUSIONS: Combining anti-falsifying strategies targeting different levels of the pharmaceutical supply chain provides multiple barriers of protection from falsified medicines. This requires the political will to drive policy implementation; otherwise, people around the world remain at risk.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This study examined genomic factors associated with a reduction in 18fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) uptake during positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) for definitive chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in patients with pharyngeal cancer.\nMETHODS: The pretreatment and interim PET-CT images of 25 patients with advanced pharyngeal cancers receiving definitive CRT were prospectively evaluated. The maximum standardized uptake value (SUV<sub>max</sub>) of the interim PET-CT and the reduction ratio of the SUV<sub>max</sub> (SRR) between the two images were measured. Genomic data from pretreatment incisional biopsy specimens (SLC2A1, CAIX, VEGF, HIF1A, BCL2, Claudin-4, YAP1, MET, MKI67, and EGFR) were analyzed using tissue microarrays. Differences in FDG uptake and SRRs between tumors with low and high gene expression were examined using the Mann-Whitney test. Cox regression analysis was performed to examine the effects of variables on local control.\nRESULTS: The SRR of the primary tumors (SRR-P) was 0.59\u2009\u00b1\u20090.31, whereas the SRR of metastatic lymph nodes (SRR-N) was 0.54\u2009\u00b1\u20090.32. Overexpression of HIF1A was associated with a high iSUV<sub>max</sub> of the primary tumor (P\u2009&lt;\u20090.001) and neck lymph node (P\u2009=\u20090.04) and a low SRR-P (P\u2009=\u20090.02). Multivariate analysis revealed that patients who had tumors with low SRR-P or high HIF1A expression levels showed inferior local control.\nCONCLUSION: In patients with pharyngeal cancer requiring CRT, HIF1A overexpression was positively associated with high interim SUV<sub>max</sub> or a slow reduction in FDG uptake. Prospective trials are needed to determine whether the local control rate can be stratified using the HIF1A level as a biomarker and SRR-P.",

The Collaborative Workshop on Aquatic Models and 21st Century Toxicology was held at North Carolina State University on May 5-6, 2014, in Raleigh, North Carolina, USA. Participants discussed the ways in which small fish are being used as models to screen toxicants and understand mechanisms of toxicity. Workshop participants agreed that the lack of standardized protocols is an impediment to broader acceptance of these models, whereas development of standardized protocols, validation, and subsequent regulatory acceptance would facilitate greater usage. Given the advantages and increasing application of small fish models, there was widespread interest in follow-up workshops to review and discuss developments in their use. In this article, we summarize the recommendations formulated by workshop participants to enhance the utility of small fish species in toxicology studies, as well as many of the advances in the field of toxicology that resulted from using small fish species, including advances in developmental toxicology, cardiovascular toxicology, neurotoxicology, and immunotoxicology. We alsoreview many emerging issues that will benefit from using small fish species, especially zebrafish, and new technologies that will enable using these organisms to yield results unprecedented in their information content to better understand how toxicants affect development and health.",

The potential of \"big data\" for improving health is enormous but, at the same time, we face a wide range of challenges to overcome urgently. Europe is very proud of its cultural diversity; however, exploitation of the data made available through advances in genomic medicine, imaging, and a wide range of mobile health applications or connected devices is hampered by numerous historical, technical, legal, and political barriers. European health systems and databases are diverse and fragmented. There is a lack of harmonization of data formats, processing, analysis, and data transfer, which leads to incompatibilities and lost opportunities. Legal frameworks for data sharing are evolving.

The JAX-CTP\u2122 assay detects actionable variants in the form of single nucleotide variations, small insertions and deletions (\u226450\u00a0bp), and copy number variants in 358 genes in specimens containing a neoplastic cell content of \u226550%. The JAX-CKB is a comprehensive database that curates tumor phenotype, genetic variant and protein effect, therapeutic relevance, and available treatment options.\nRESULTS: 18/20 (90%) of TNBCs contained at least one somatic mutation detected by the JAX-CTP\u2122. MYC amplification was the most common alteration, present in 75% of tumors. TP53, AURKA, and KDR mutations were each present in 30% (6/20) of cases. Related recruiting clinical trials, extracted from JAX-CKB, included 166 for breast cancer, of which 17 were specific to only the TNBC subtype. All 17 trials were testing at least one therapy that targets a mutation identified in this sample set. The majority (89%) of tumors with basal-like histologic features had MYC amplification.\nCONCLUSIONS: The expanded gene panel identified a variety of clinically actionable gene alterations in TNBCs. The identification of such variants increases the possibility for new therapeutic interventions and clinical trial eligibility for TNBC patients.",

        "abstract": "CONTEXT: Jansen's metaphyseal chondrodysplasia (JMC) is a rare skeletal dysplasia characterized by abnormal endochondral bone formation and typically severe hypercalcemia despite normal/low levels of PTH. Five different heterozygous activating PTH/PTHrP receptor (PTH1R) mutations that change one of three different amino acid residues are known to cause JMC.\nOBJECTIVES: Establishing the diagnosis of JMC during infancy or early childhood can be challenging, especially in the absence of family history and/or overt hypercalcemia. We therefore sought to provide radiographic findings supporting this diagnosis early in life.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: Three patients, a mother and her two sons, had radiographic evidence for JMC. However, obvious hypercalcemia and suppressed PTH levels were encountered only in both affected children. Sanger sequencing and endonuclease (SphI) digestion of PCR-amplified genomic DNA were performed to search for the H223R-PTH1R mutation.\nRESULTS: The heterozygous H223R mutation was identified in all three affected individuals. Surprisingly, however, the now 38-year-old mother was never overtly hypercalcemic and was therefore not diagnosed until her sons were found to be affected by JMC at the ages of 28 months and 40 days, respectively. The presented radiographic findings at different ages will help diagnose other infants/toddlers suspected of having JMC.\nCONCLUSION: The H223R mutation is typically associated with profound hypercalcemia despite low/normal PTH levels. However, the findings presented herein show that overt hypercalcemia is not always encountered in JMC, even if caused by this relatively frequent mutation, which is similar to observations with other PTH1R mutations that show less constitutive activity.",

We used the best clinical estimate of zygosity based on the concept that all monochorionic twins are monozygotic and all unlike-sex pairs are dizygotic, thus excluding same-sex dichorionic twin gestations for which zygosity cannot be ascertained on clinical grounds. Study cohorts were twin pregnancies with or without preeclampsia and gestational hypertension.\nRESULTS: A total of 3419 twin gestations met the inclusion criteria, of which 442 (12.9%) were monochorionic and 1255 (36.7%) were unlike-sex twins, excluding 1722 same-sex dichorionic twin gestations (50.4%). There was no significant difference in the incidence of preeclampsia (OR: 0.9; 95% CI: 0.4-2.0 for monozygotic males and OR: 0.6; 95% CI: 0.3-1.4 for monozygotic females) and gestational hypertension (OR: 0.7; 95% CI: 0.2-2.5 for monozygotic males, and OR: 0.7; 95% CI: 0.2-2.3 for monozygotic females) between monochorionic and unlike-sex pairs.

Genetic predisposition, autoimmunity, and stress may each play a role. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a cytokine that plays a role in the regulation of macrophage function. It also initiates inflammation and immune response by regulating a number of proinflammatory cytokines.\nOBJECTIVES: This study was designed to study serum and lesional skin biopsy MIF levels in AA patients and to assess their associations with disease severity.\nMETHODS: This study included 30 patients with AA and 15 age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects. Quantitative measurements of MIF concentrations in sera and skin samples were obtained in both patients and control subjects. Associations with disease severity (assessed using the Severity of Alopecia Tool) were evaluated.\nRESULTS: Mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD) MIF levels in serum and skin were significantly higher in AA patients (45.03 \u00b1 26.98 ng/ml and 73.83 \u00b1 29.81 ng/ml, respectively) than in controls (7.73 \u00b1 1.62 ng/ml and 0.40 \u00b1 1.12 ng/ml, respectively) (P < 0.01).

        "abstract": "The revolution in cancer genomics has uncovered a variety of clinically relevant mutations in primary brain tumours, creating an urgent need to develop non-invasive imaging biomarkers to assess and integrate this genetic information into the clinical management of patients. Metabolic reprogramming is a central hallmark of cancer, including brain tumours; indeed, many of the molecular pathways implicated in the pathogenesis of brain tumours result in reprogramming of metabolism. This relationship provides the opportunity to devise in vivo metabolic imaging modalities to improve diagnosis, patient stratification, and monitoring of treatment response. Metabolic phenomena, such as the Warburg effect and altered mitochondrial metabolism, can be leveraged to image brain tumours using techniques including PET and MRI. Moreover, genetic alterations, such as mutations affecting isocitrate dehydrogenase, are associated with unique metabolic signatures that can be detected using magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The need to translate our understanding of the molecular features of brain tumours into imaging modalities with clinical utility is growing; metabolic imaging provides a unique platform to achieve this objective. In this Review, we examine the molecular basis for metabolic reprogramming in brain tumours, and examine current non-invasive metabolic imaging strategies that can be used to interrogate these molecular characteristics with the ultimate goal of guiding and improving patient care.",

We calculated local ancestry for Swiss Fleckvieh, a composite of Simmental (SI) and Red Holstein Friesian (RHF), to infer such signals. Illumina Bovine SNP50 BeadChip data for 300 admixed, 88 SI and 97 RHF bulls were used. The average RHF ancestry across the whole genome was 0.70. To identify regions with high deviation from average, we considered two significance thresholds, based on a permutation test and extreme deviation from normal distribution. Regions on chromosomes 13 (46.3-47.3\u00a0Mb) and 18 (18.7-25.9\u00a0Mb) passed both thresholds in the direction of increased SI. Extended haplotype homozygosity within (iHS) and between (Rsb) populations was calculated to explore additional patterns of pre- and post-admixture selection signals. The Rsb score of admixed and SI was significant in a wide region of chromosome 18 (6.6-24.6\u00a0Mb) overlapped with one area of strong local ancestry deviation. FTO, with pleiotropic effect on milk and fertility, NOD2 on dairy and NKD1 and SALL1 on fertility traits are located there. Genetic differentiation of RHF and SI (F<sub>st</sub> ), an alternative indicator of pre-admixture selection in pure populations, was calculated. No considerable overlap of peaks of local ancestry deviations and F<sub>st</sub> was observed. We found two regions with significant signatures of post-admixture selection in this very young composite, applying comparatively stringent significance thresholds.

Because many cancer cells exhibit chromosome aneuploidy, we explored whether changes of aneuploidy status result in drug resistance. Two typical colorectal cancer cells, HCT116 and LoVo, were cultured with the chemotherapeutic drugs irinotecan (SN38) or oxaliplatin (QxPt), and the non- and drug-resistant cell lines were selected. Whole exome sequencing (WES) was employed to evaluate the aneuploidy status of these cells, and RNAseq and LC-MS/MS were implemented to examine gene expression at both mRNA and protein level. The data of gene expression was well-matched with the genomic conclusion that HCT116 was a near diploid cell, whereas LoVo was an aneuploid cell with the increased abundance of mRNA and protein for these genes located at chromosomes 5, 7, 12, and 15. By comparing the genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data, the LoVo cells with SN38 tolerance showed an increased genome copy in chromosome 14, and the expression levels of the genes on this chromosome were also significantly increased. Thus, we first observed that SN38 could impact the aneuploidy status in cancer cells, which was partially associated with the acquired drug resistance.",

Interventions addressing the supportive care needs of people with melanoma are rare, and needs are often overlooked. The study evaluated a newly developed, evidence-based, psycho-educational resource for people with melanoma.\nMETHODS: The evaluation study comprised three groups: adults at high risk of new primary disease due to multiple previous melanomas or one melanoma and dysplastic nevus syndrome (DNS), adults at moderate risk due to one previous melanoma and no DNS, and health professionals involved in melanoma care. Participants evaluated a 68-page psycho-educational booklet, Melanoma: Questions and Answers, developed by a multidisciplinary team in accordance with published evidence, clinical guidelines, and intervention development frameworks. The booklet comprised seven modules featuring information on melanoma diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and ongoing clinical management; risk factors and the role of genetic counseling services for melanoma; psycho-education on emotional, behavioral, and cognitive responses to melanoma, including psycho-education on fear of cancer recurrence; description of healthy coping responses; a suite of tailored tools to support skin self-examination, doctor-patient communication, and identification of the signs and symptoms of anxiety and depression; a list of community-based services and resources; and tools to support melanoma-related record keeping and monitoring. Resource acceptability, relevance, quality, dissemination preferences, emotional responses, unmet information needs, and demographic characteristics were assessed.\nRESULTS: Nineteen melanoma survivors (response rate 50\u00a0%) and 10 health professionals (response rate 83\u00a0%) evaluated the resource. Responses were overwhelmingly positive; the booklet was thoroughly read and highly rated in terms of quality and quantity of information, utility of health education tools, and capacity to address unmet needs. Ninety-five percent of melanoma survivors would recommend the booklet to others. Most preferred a paper-based format, provided by their treating doctor at diagnosis.\nCONCLUSIONS: Melanoma: Questions and Answers was feasible and acceptable and demonstrated a strong capacity to address the information and psycho-educational needs of people with melanoma at low fiscal cost.",

        "title": "Aneuploidy and Tetraploidy as Distinct Patterns During Melanomagenesis.",
        "abstract": "Melanoma is characterized by a high degree of chromosome instability (CIN), the loss or gain of entire chromosomes or pieces of chromosomes. Also, CIN is likely to drive the progression of benign melanocytic lesions to malignant tumors, although very little is known about the acquisition of the mechanisms that promote CIN along this progression. Here, we describe the development of a model system to study the progression of melanomagenesis starting with normal human melanocytes followed by inactivation of the p53 and pRb tumor suppressors by addition of the E6/E7 proteins. The cells were then transduced with a growth-promoting, constitutionally-active mutant NRAS. The addition of E6/E7 and E6/E7 NRAS was found to give a growth advantage to the cells compared to normal melanocytes and a statistically significant gain of aneuploidy; aneuploidy was 24.7% in primary melanocytes, 33.8% in E6/E7 melanocytes, and 70.5% in E6/E7 NRAS melanocytes. Further, we found an increase in tetraploid cells in the cell model which was statistically significant between primary melanocytes and E6/E7, NRAS melanocytes. We also observed an increase in aneuploid cells between three population doublings in primary melanocytes, whereas this increase was not seen in the E6/E7 melanocytes. Together, these data demonstrate that this model system utilizing stepwise addition of genetic mutations driving melanomagenesis is a useful tool to study CIN and could even be used to study the mechanisms responsible for these alterations in genetic makeup.",

        "abstract": "STUDY QUESTION: What are the mechanisms by which the preimplantation restraint stress (PIRS) impairs embryo development and pregnancy outcome?\nSUMMARY ANSWER: PIRS impairs embryo development by triggering apoptosis in mouse oviducts and embryos,and this involves activation of the Fas system.\nWHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Although it is known that the early stages of pregnancy are more vulnerable than later stages to prenatalstress, studies on the effect of preimplantation stress on embryo developmentare limited. Furthermore, the mechanisms by which psychological stress impairs embryo development are largely unknown. These issues are worth exploring using the mouse PIRS models because restraint of mice is an efficient experimental procedure developed for studies of psychogenic stress.\nSTUDY DESIGN, SIZE AND DURATION: Mice of Kunming strain, the generalized lymphoproliferative disorder (gld) mice with a germline mutation F273L in FasL in a C57BL/6J genomic background and the wild-type C57BL/6J mice were used. Female and male mice were used 8-10 weeks and 10-12 weeks after birth, respectively. Female mice showing vaginal plugs were paired by weight and randomly assigned to restraint treatments or as controls. For restraint treatment, an individual mouse was put in a micro-cage with food and water available. Control mice remained in their cages with food and water during the time treated females were stressed.\nPARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Female mice were exposed to PIRS for 48 h starting from 16:00 on the day of vaginal plug detection. At the end of PIRS, levels of glucorticoids (GC), corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH)and redox potential were measured in serum, while levels of GC, GC receptor (GR), CRH, CRH receptor (CRHR), Fas and Fas ligand (FasL) protein, mRNAs for brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), oxidative stress (OS) and apoptosis were examined in oviducts. Preimplantation development and levels of GR, Fas, redox potential and apoptosis were observed in embryos recovered at different times after the initiation of PIRS. The gld mice were used to confirm a role for the Fas system in triggering apoptosis of embryos and oviducts.\nMAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Compared to those in control mice, while the number of blastocysts/mouse (5.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.7 versus 11.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5), cell number/blastocyst (49.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.3 versus 61.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.9), percentages of term pregnancy (37.5% versus 90.9%) and litter size (3.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1versus 9.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.6) decreased, blood CRH (560\u00a0\u00b1\u00a023 versus 455\u00a0\u00b1\u00a037 pg/ml), cortisol (27.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.4 versus 5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5 ng/ml) and OS index (OSI: 2.8 versus 1.7) increased significantly (all P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) following PIRS. In the oviduct, while levels of CRH (1175\u00a0\u00b1\u00a085 versus 881\u00a0\u00b1\u00a033 pg/100 mg), cortisol (28.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.7 versus14\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04 ng/g), CRHR (2.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3 versus 1.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.0), FasL (1.31\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.06 versus 1.08\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.05 ng/g), Fas (1.42\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.13 versus 1.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.0) and apoptotic cells (19.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5% versus 8.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.4%) increased, levels of GR proteins (0.67\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.14 versus 1.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.0) and Igf-1 (0.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.09 versus 1.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.0) and Bdnf (0.73\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.03 versus 1.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.0) mRNAs decreased significantly (all P\u00a0<\u00a00.05 versus control) after PIRS. Mouse embryos expressed GR and Fas at all stages of preimplantation development and embryo OS (GSH/GSSG ratio: 0.88\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.03 versus 1.19\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.13) and annexin-positive cells (blastocysts: 31.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.8% versus 10.96\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.4%) increased significantly (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) following PIRS. Furthermore, the detrimental effects of PIRS on embryo development and oviductal apoptosis were much reduced in gld mice. Thus, PIRS triggered apoptosis in oviductal cells with activation of the Fas/FasL system. The apoptotic oviductal cells promoted embryo apoptosis with reduced production of IGF-1 and BDNF and increased production of FasL.\nLIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Although important, the conclusions were drawn from limited results obtained using a single model in one species and thus they need further verification using other models and/or in other species. Furthermore, as differences in stressed samples were modest and sometimes not significant between gld and wild-type mice whereas differences between control and stressed samples were always present within gld mice, it is deduced that signaling pathways other than the Fas/FasL system might be involved as well in the PIRS-triggered apoptosis of oviducts and embryos.\nWIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: The data are important for studies on the mechanisms by which psychological stress affects female reproduction, as FasL expression has been observed in human oviduct epithelium.\nLARGE SCALE DATA: Not applicable.\nSTUDY FUNDING AND COMPETING INTERESTS: This study was supported by grants from the National Basic Research Program of China (Nos. 2014CB138503 and 2012CB944403), the China National Natural Science Foundation (Nos. 31272444 and 30972096) and the Animal breeding improvement program of Shandong Province.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To identify genetic and environmental risk factors for otitis media in an indigenous Filipino population.\nSTUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.\nSETTING: Indigenous Filipino community.\nSUBJECTS AND METHODS: Clinical history and information on breastfeeding, tobacco smoke exposure, and swimming were obtained from community members. Heads of households were interviewed for family history and personal beliefs on ear health. Height and weight were measured. Otoscopic findings were described for the presence and character of perforation or discharge. An A2ML1 duplication variant that confers otitis media susceptibility was Sanger sequenced in all DNA samples. Co-occurrence of middle ear bacteria detected by 16S rRNA gene sequencing was determined according to A2ML1 genotype and social cluster.\nRESULTS: The indigenous Filipino population has a ~50% prevalence of otitis media. Young age was associated with otitis media (4 age strata; P = .004); however, age was nonsignificant as a bistratal or continuous variable. There was no association between otitis media and sex, body mass index, breastfeeding, tobacco exposure, or deep swimming. In multivariate analyses, A2ML1 genotype is the strongest predictor of otitis media, with an odds ratio of 3.7 (95% confidence interval: 1.3-10.8; P = .005). When otitis media diagnoses were plotted across ages, otitis media was observed within the first year of life, and chronic otitis media persisted up to adulthood, particularly in A2ML1-variant carriers.\nCONCLUSION: Among indigenous Filipinos, A2ML1 genotype is the primary risk factor for otitis media and main determinant of disease progression, although age, the middle ear microbiome, and social clusters might modulate the effect of the A2ML1 genotype.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Common variants have been associated with prostate cancer risk. Unfortunately, few are reproducibly linked to aggressive disease, the phenotype of greatest clinical relevance. One possible explanation is that rare genetic variants underlie a significant proportion of the risk for aggressive disease.\nMETHOD: To identify such variants, we performed a two-stage approach using whole-exome sequencing followed by targeted sequencing of 800 genes in 652 aggressive prostate cancer patients and 752 disease-free controls in both African and European Americans. In each population, we tested rare variants for association using two gene-based aggregation tests. We established a study-wide significance threshold of 3.125 \u00d7 10-5 to correct for multiple testing.\nRESULTS: TET2 in African Americans was associated with aggressive disease, with 24.4% of cases harboring a rare deleterious variant compared with 9.6% of controls (FET P = 1.84 \u00d7 10-5, OR = 3.0; SKAT-O P = 2.74 \u00d7 10-5). We report 8 additional genes with suggestive evidence of association, including the DNA repair genes PARP2 and MSH6 Finally, we observed an excess of rare truncation variants in 5 genes, including the DNA repair genes MSH6, BRCA1, and BRCA2 This adds to the growing body of evidence that DNA repair pathway defects may influence susceptibility to aggressive prostate cancer.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that rare variants influence risk of clinically relevant prostate cancer and, if validated, could serve to identify men for screening, prophylaxis, and treatment.\nIMPACT: This study provides evidence that rare variants in TET2 may help identify African American men at increased risk for clinically relevant prostate cancer.

PeptideAtlas and GPMDB reanalyze all major human mass spectrometry data sets available through ProteomeXchange with standardized protocols and stringent quality filters; neXtProt curates and integrates mass spectrometry and other findings to present the most up to date authorative compendium of the human proteome. The HPP Guidelines for Mass Spectrometry Data Interpretation version 2.1 were applied to manuscripts submitted for this 2016 C-HPP-led special issue [ www.thehpp.org/guidelines ]. The Human Proteome presented as neXtProt version 2016-02 has 16,518 confident protein identifications (Protein Existence [PE] Level 1), up from 13,664 at 2012-12, 15,646 at 2013-09, and 16,491 at 2014-10. There are 485 proteins that would have been PE1 under the Guidelines v1.0 from 2012 but now have insufficient evidence due to the agreed-upon more stringent Guidelines v2.0 to reduce false positives. neXtProt and PeptideAtlas now both require two non-nested, uniquely mapping (proteotypic) peptides of at least 9 aa in length. There are 2,949 missing proteins (PE2+3+4) as the baseline for submissions for this fourth annual C-HPP special issue of Journal of Proteome Research. PeptideAtlas has 14,629 canonical (plus 1187 uncertain and 1755 redundant) entries. GPMDB has 16,190 EC4 entries, and the Human Protein Atlas has 10,475 entries with supportive evidence. neXtProt, PeptideAtlas, and GPMDB are rich resources of information about post-translational modifications (PTMs), single amino acid variants (SAAVSs), and splice isoforms.

Here, we assess the applicability and performance of the MiSeq FGx\u2122 & ForenSeq\u2122 DNA Signature Prep Kit (Illumina) for the identification of individuals from the mass graves of the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939). The main limitations for individual identification are the low number of possible first-degree living relatives and the high levels of DNA degradation reported in previous studies. Massively parallel sequencing technologies enabling the analysis of hundreds of regions and prioritizing short length amplicons constitute a promising tool for this kind of approaches. In this study, we first explore the power of this new technology to detect first- and second-degree kinship given different scenarios of DNA degradation. Second, we specifically assess its performance in a set of low DNA input samples previously analyzed with CE technologies. We conclude that this methodology will allow identification of up to second-degree relatives, even in situations with low sequencing performance and important levels of allele drop-out; it is thus a technology that resolves previous drawbacks and that will allow a successful approximation to the identification of remains.",

        "abstract": "Dysfunction of homologous recombination is a common denominator of changes associated with breast cancer-predisposing mutations. In our previous work, we identified a functional signature in peripheral blood lymphocytes from women who were predisposed that indicated a shift from homologous recombination to alternative, error-prone DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair pathways. To capture both hereditary and nonhereditary factors, we newly established a protocol for isolation and ex vivo analysis of epithelial cells, epithelial-mesenchymal transition cells (EMTs), and fibroblasts from breast cancer specimens (147 patients). By applying a fluorescence-based test system, we analyzed the error-prone DSB repair pathway microhomology-mediated end joining in these tumor-derived cell types and peripheral blood lymphocytes. In parallel, we investigated DNA lesion processing by quantitative immunofluorescence microscopy of histone H2AX phosphorylated on Ser139 focus after radiomimetic treatment. Our study reveals elevated histone H2AX phosphorylated on Ser139 damage removal in epithelial cells, not EMTs, and poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase inhibitor sensitivities, which suggested a DSB repair pathway shift with increasing patient age. Of interest, we found elevated microhomology-mediated end joining in EMTs, not epithelial cells, from patients who received a treatment recommendation of adjuvant chemotherapy, that is, those with high-risk tumors. Our discoveries of altered DSB repair activities in cells may serve as a method to further classify breast cancer to predict responsiveness to adjuvant chemotherapy and/or therapeutics that target DSB repair-dysfunctional tumors.-Deniz, M., Kaufmann, J., Stahl, A., Gundelach, T., Janni, W., Hoffmann, I., Keimling, M., Hampp, S., Ihle, M., Wiesm\u00fcller, L.

Although genetic lesions in either component can be risk factors for disease in patients, whether these pathways interact in the development of AD is not clear. To test this, we mated mice with T-cell specific expression of constitutively active Stat6 (Stat6VT) that spontaneously develop allergic skin inflammation with Flaky tail (Ft) mice that have mutations in Flg and Tmem79 genes that each affect skin barrier function. Our results demonstrate that over 90% of the Stat6VT transgenic mice carrying the Ft alleles (Stat6VTxFt-/- ) develop severe atopic dermatitis lesions by 3-5 months of age, compared with only 40% of Stat6VT mice that develop disease by 6-7 months of age. Further, histopathological analysis of skin tissues from Stat6VTxFt-/- mice revealed extensive thickening of the dermis with increased inflammatory infiltrates as compared with Stat6VT mice.

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Among patients with ovarian cancer, African American (AA) women experience poorer survival compared with other race/ethnicity groups. This has been attributed to differences in access to health care.\nEXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We evaluated racial/ethnic differences in chemotherapy dosing and survival in a cohort study among members of Kaiser Permanente Northern California, and thus with equivalent access to health care. Analyses included epithelial-invasive ovarian cancer cases (n = 793) receiving adjuvant first-line therapy of carboplatin and paclitaxel with curative intent, with median follow-up of 50 months. Relative dose intensity (RDI) was computed for carboplatin and paclitaxel separately as dose administered per week divided by expected dose per week, and average RDI (ARDI) was then calculated for the regimen. Proportional hazards regression was used to calculate HRs and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) after adjusting for relevant covariates.\nRESULTS: Compared with whites, AAs were more likely to have dose reduction (ARDI < 85%), treatment delay, and early discontinuation. Hispanics were also more likely to have dose reduction, but less likely to have early discontinuation or treatment delay. After controlling for prognostic factors including ARDI, AA women had the worst survival. Compared with whites, adjusted HRs (95% CI) for overall mortality were 1.56 (1.01-2.39) for AAs; 0.89 (0.61-1.31) for Asians; and 1.41 (0.98-2.04) for Hispanics. Findings for ovarian cancer-specific mortality were similar.\nCONCLUSIONS: Disparities in ovarian cancer treatment and survival in AA persisted among women with equal access to care. These findings warrant further evaluation of biological, personal, and social factors that may be responsible for these differences. Clin Cancer Res; 22(23); 5909-14. \u00a92016 AACR.",

        "abstract": "Screening for fetal aneuploidy in pregnant women using cell-free DNA has increased dramatically since the technology became commercially available in 2011. Since that time, numerous trials have demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity to screen for common aneuploidies in high-risk populations. Studies assessing the performance of these tests in low-risk populations have also demonstrated improved detection rates compared with traditional, serum-based screening strategies. Concurrent with the increased use of this technology has been a decrease in invasive procedures (amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling). As the technology becomes more widely understood, available, and utilized, challenges regarding its clinical implementation have become apparent. Some of these challenges include test failures, false-positive and false-negative results, limitations in positive predictive value in low-prevalence populations, and potential maternal health implications of abnormal results. In addition, commercial laboratories are expanding screening beyond common aneuploidies to include microdeletion screening and whole genome screening.

One challenge is that much of the reported research relies on tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to act as proxies for assumed underlying functional variants that are not yet known. Here we use coronary artery disease and melanoma as case studies to evaluate how well reported genetic risk variants tag surrounding variants across population samples in the 1000 Genomes Project Phase 3 data. We performed a simulation study where we randomly assigned a \"functional\" variant and evaluated how often this simulated functional variant was correctly tagged in diverse population samples. Our results indicate a relatively large error rate when generalizing increased genetic risk of complex disease across diverse population samples, even when generalizing within geographic regions. Our results further highlight the importance of including diverse populations in genome-wide association studies. Future work focused on identifying functional variants will eliminate the need for tag SNPs; however, until functional variants are known, caution should be used in the interpretation of genetic risk for complex disease using tag SNPs.",

However, the underlying mechanism of these abnormalities is not understood. Hcy-thiolactone has the ability to form isopeptide bonds with protein lysine residues, which generates N-homocysteinylated protein. Because lysine residues are involved in collagen cross-linking, N-homocysteinylation of these lysines should impair cross-linking. Using a Tg-I278T Cbs-/- mouse model of hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) which replicates the connective tissue abnormalities observed in CBS-deficient patients, we found that N-Hcy-collagen was elevated in bone, tail, and heart of Cbs-/- mice, whereas pyridinoline cross-links were significantly reduced. Plasma deoxypyridinoline cross-link and cross-linked carboxyterminal telopeptide of type I collagen were also significantly reduced in the Cbs-/- mice. Lysine oxidase activity and mRNA level were not reduced by the Cbs-/- genotype. We also showed that collagen carries S-linked Hcy bound to the thiol of N-linked Hcy. In vitro experiments showed that Hcy-thiolactone modifies lysine residues in collagen type I \u03b1-1 chain. Residue K160, located in the nonhelical N-telopeptide region and involved in pyridinoline cross-link formation, was also N-homocysteinylated in vivo Taken together, our findings showed that N-homocysteinylation of collagen in Cbs-/- mice impairs its cross-linking.

The purpose of this study was to perform a meta-analysis to determine the effect of NOD2/CARD15 polymorphisms on treatment response in patients with CD.\nMETHODS: Medline, Cochrane, EMBASE, and Google Scholar databases were searched until 19 December 2015 using the keywords: NOD2, CARD15, polymorphism, Crohn's disease. Randomized controlled trials, prospective, retrospective, and cohort studies of patients with CD who received NOD2/CARD15 genetic analysis and were treated with monoclonal antibodies were included.

        "abstract": "The inherited palmoplantar keratodermas (PPKs) are a heterogeneous group of genodermatoses, characterized by thickening of the epidermis of the palms and soles. No classification system satisfactorily unites clinical presentation, pathology and molecular pathogenesis. There are four patterns of hyperkeratosis - striate, focal, diffuse and punctate. Mutations in the desmoglein 1 gene (DSG1), a transmembrane glycoprotein, have been reported primarily in striate, but also in focal and diffuse PPKs. We report seven unrelated pedigrees with dominantly inherited PPK owing to mutations in the DSG1 gene, with marked phenotypic variation. Genomic DNA from each family was isolated, and individual exons amplified by polymerase chain reaction. Sanger sequencing was employed to identify mutations. Mutation analysis identified novel mutations in five families (p.Tyr126Hisfs*2, p.Ser521Tyrfs*2, p.Trp3*, p.Asp591Phefs*9 and p.Met249Ilefs*6) with striate palmar involvement and varying focal or diffuse plantar disease, and the recurrent mutation c.76C>T, p.Arg26*, in two families with variable PPK patterns. We report one recurrent and five novel DSG1 mutations, causing varying patterns of PPK, highlighting the clinical heterogeneity arising from mutations in this gene.",

        "abstract": "Rearrangements of the ROS1 gene occur in 1-2\u00a0% of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs). Crizotinib, a highly effective inhibitor of ROS1 kinase activity, is now FDA-approved for the treatment of patients with advanced ROS1-positive NSCLC. Consequently, focus on ROS1 testing is growing. Most laboratories currently rely on fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) assays using a dual-colour break-apart probe to detect ROS1 rearrangements. Given the rarity of these rearrangements in NSCLC, detection of elevated ROS1 protein levels by immunohistochemistry may provide cost-effective screening prior to confirmatory FISH testing. Non-in situ testing approaches also hold potential as stand-alone methods or complementary tests, including multiplex real-time PCR assays and next-generation sequencing (NGS) platforms which include commercial test kits covering a range of fusion genes. In order to ensure high-quality biomarker testing, appropriate tissue handling, adequate control materials and participation in external quality assessment programmes are essential, irrespective of the testing technique employed. ROS1 testing is often only considered after negative tests for EGFR mutation and ALK gene rearrangement, based on the assumption that these oncogenic driver events tend to be exclusive. However, as the use of ROS1 inhibitors becomes routine, accurate and timely detection of ROS1 gene rearrangements will be critical for the optimal treatment of patients with NSCLC. As NGS techniques are introduced into routine diagnostic practice, ROS1 fusion gene testing will be provided as part of the initial testing package.",

Then, we determined the agreement of exome and chip genotypes by evaluating concordance in a three-way comparison of exome, genome, and chip-based genotyping at 1,929 variant positions in five individuals. Finally, we evaluated the utility of exomes for detecting CYP2D6 CNVs.\nRESULTS: For 5 individuals examined for 203 pharmacogenetic variants (5\u2009\u00d7\u2009203 = 1,015), 998/1,015 were identified by genome, 849/1,015 were identified by exome, and 295/1,015 by genotyping chip. Thirty-six pharmacogenetic star allele variants with moderate to strong Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) therapeutic recommendations were identified in 973 exomes. Exomes had high (98%) genotype concordance with chip-based genotyping. CYP2D6 CNVs were identified in 57/973 exomes.\nCONCLUSIONS: Exomes outperformed the current chip-based assay in detecting more important pharmacogenetic variant positions and CYP2D6 CNVs for preemptive pharmacogenetic screening.

We model the interaction between the hospitals and the manufacturer of a new treatment as an adverse selection problem where the firm does not have perfect information on the prevalence across hospitals of the genetic characteristics of the patients making them eligible to receive a new treatment. As a result of the model, hospitals with high prevalence rates benefit from the information asymmetry only when the standard treatment is inefficient when applied to the patients eligible to receive the new treatment.

In Chile, cervical cancer is the second leading cause of death among women of reproductive age, causing more than 600 deaths annually. This study was carried out to determine the burden and confirm the predominant human papillomavirus (HPV) genotypes among women presenting for cervical cancer screening in public health services in Chile. Women aged 18-64\u00a0years residing in the north and central areas covered by six primary care centers of Santiago, Chile, were invited to participate from March 2014 to August 2015. Cervical swabs were examined both HPV genotyping by PCR and Reverse Line Blot, and cervical cytology by Pap testing. A total of 1738 women were included in this study: 11.1\u00a0% were HPV positive, 9.7\u00a0% were high-risk types positive, 3.2\u00a0% were low-risk types positive, 1.4\u00a0% were Pap positive and 0.9\u00a0% were positive by both tests. The four most predominant genotypes were 16, 66, 51 and 59, with prevalence of 2.8, 1.4, 1.2 and 1.2\u00a0%, respectively. Multiple HPV infections were detected among 3.8\u00a0% participants. Age-specific prevalence of HPV showed a peak in HPV infection at younger ages (\u226430\u00a0years), declining to a plateau in middle age. Among women with normal cytology, the 9.4\u00a0% were HPV positive, while 58.3\u00a0% of women with abnormal cytology were HPV positive. These findings show new epidemiological data confirming HPV 16 and 66 as the most predominant genotypes in Chile.

        "abstract": "Over the past decade, testing the genes of patients and their specific cancer types has become standardized practice in medical oncology since somatic mutations, changes in gene expression and epigenetic modifications are all hallmarks of cancer. However, while cancer genetic assessment has been limited to single biomarkers to guide the use of therapies, improvements in nucleic acid sequencing technologies and implementation of different genome analysis tools have enabled clinicians to detect these genomic alterations and identify functional and disease-associated genomic variants. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have provided clues about therapeutic targets and genomic markers for novel clinical applications when standard therapy has failed. While Sanger sequencing, an accurate and sensitive approach, allows for the identification of potential novel variants, it is however limited by the single amplicon being interrogated. Similarly, quantitative and qualitative profiling of gene expression changes also represents a challenge for the cancer field. Both RT-PCR and microarrays are efficient approaches, but are limited to the genes present on the array or being assayed. This leaves vast swaths of the transcriptome, including non-coding RNAs and other features, unexplored. With the advent of the ability to collect and analyze genomic sequence data in a timely fashion and at an ever-decreasing cost, many of these limitations have been overcome and are being incorporated into cancer research and diagnostics giving patients and clinicians new hope for targeted and personalized treatment.

For this project, a multiplex methylation SNaPshot reaction composed of seven CpG markers was used for the identification of four body fluids, including blood, saliva, semen, and vaginal fluid. A total of 30 specimens were prepared and distributed to participating laboratories after thorough testing. The required experiments included four increasingly complex tasks: (1) CE of a purified single-base extension reaction product, (2) multiplex PCR and multiplex single-base extension reaction of bisulfite-modified DNA, (3) bisulfite conversion of genomic DNA, and (4) extraction of genomic DNA from body fluid samples. In tasks 2, 3 and 4, one or more mixtures were analyzed, and specimens containing both known and unknown body fluid sources were used. Six of the laboratories generated consistent body fluid typing results for specimens of bisulfite-converted DNA and genomic DNA. One laboratory failed to set up appropriate conditions for capillary analysis of reference single-base extension products. In general, variation in the values obtained for DNA methylation analysis between laboratories increased with the complexity of the required experiments. However, all laboratories concurred on the interpretation of the DNA methylation profiles produced.

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Genetic factors and environmental exposures, including pesticides, contribute to the risk of Parkinson's disease (PD). There have been few studies of gene and pesticide exposure interactions in PD, and all of the prior studies used a candidate gene approach.\nMETHODS: We performed the first genome-wide gene-environment interaction analysis of pesticide exposure and risk of Parkinson's disease. Analyses were performed using data on >700,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 364 discordant sibling pairs. In addition to testing for SNP-pesticide interaction effects, we also performed exploratory analyses of gene-pesticide interactions at the gene level.\nRESULTS: None of the gene-environment interaction results were significant after genome-wide correction for multiple testing (\u03b1\u00a0=\u00a01.5E-07 for SNP-level tests; \u03b1\u00a0=\u00a02.1E-06 for gene-level tests). Top results in the SNP-level tests provided suggestive evidence (P\u00a0<\u00a05.0E-06) that the effect of pesticide exposure on PD risk may be modified by SNPs in the ERCC6L2 gene (P\u00a0=\u00a02.4E-06), which was also supported by suggestive evidence in the gene-level analysis (P\u00a0=\u00a04.7E-05). None of the candidate genes assessed in prior studies of gene-pesticide interactions reached statistical support in this genome-wide screen.\nCONCLUSION: Although no significant interactions were identified, several of the genes with suggestive evidence of gene-environment interaction effects have biological plausibility for PD risk. Further investigation of the role of those genes in PD risk, particularly in the context of pesticide exposure, in large and carefully recruited samples is warranted.",

        "abstract": "The inflammatory tissue microenvironment that promotes the development of breast cancer is not fully understood. Here we report a role for elevated IL30 in supporting the breast cancer cell viability and invasive migration. IL30 was absent in normal mammary ducts, ductules, and acini of histologically normal breast and scanty in the few stromal infiltrating leukocytes. In contrast, IL30 was expressed frequently in breast cancer specimens where it was associated with triple-negative and HER2+ molecular subtypes. In stromal leukocytes found in primary tumors or tumor-draining lymph nodes, which included mainly CD14+ monocytes, CD68+ macrophages, and CD33+/CD11b+ myeloid cells, IL30 levels increased with disease stage and correlated with recurrence. A negative correlation was determined between IL30 expression by nodal stromal leukocytes and overall survival. In vitro studies showed that human recombinant IL30 upregulated expression of a pro-oncogenic program, including especially IL6 in both triple-negative and HER2+ breast cancer cells. In triple-negative breast cancer cells, IL30 boosted a broader program of proliferation, invasive migration, and an inflammatory milieu associated with KISS1-dependent metastasis. Silencing of STAT1/STAT3 signaling hindered the regulation of the primary growth and progression factors in breast cancer cells. IL30 administration in vivo fostered the growth of triple-negative breast cancer by promoting proliferation and vascular dissemination of cancer cells and the accumulation of intratumoral CD11b+/Gr1+ myeloid cell infiltrates. Overall, our results show how IL30 regulates breast cancer cell viability, migration, and gene expression to promote breast cancer growth and progression and its impact on patient outcome.

        "abstract": "UNLABELLED: : The last decade in oncology has witnessed impressive response rates with targeted therapies, largely because of collaborative efforts at understanding tumor biology and careful patient selection based on molecular fingerprinting of the tumor. Consequently, there has been a push toward routine molecular genotyping of tumors, and large precision medicine-based clinical trials have been launched to match therapy to the molecular alteration seen in a tumor. However, selecting the \"right drug\" for an individual patient in clinic is a complex decision-making process, including analytical interpretation of the report, consideration of the importance of the molecular alteration in driving growth of the tumor, tumor heterogeneity, the availability of a matched targeted therapy, efficacy and toxicity considerations of the targeted therapy (compared with standard therapy), and reimbursement issues. In this article, we review the key considerations involved in clinical decision making while reviewing a molecular genotyping report. We present the case of a 67-year-old postmenopausal female with metastatic estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer, whose tumor progressed on multiple endocrine therapies. Molecular genotyping of the metastatic lesion revealed the presence of an ESR1 mutation (encoding p.Tyr537Asn), which was absent in the primary tumor. The same ESR1 mutation was also detected in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) extracted from her blood. The general approach for interpretation of genotyping results, the clinical significance of the specific mutation in the particular cancer, potential strategies to target the pathway, and implications for clinical practice are reviewed in this article.\nKEY POINTS: ER+ breast tumors are known to undergo genomic evolution during treatment with the acquisition of new mutations that confer resistance to treatment.ESR1 mutations in the ligand-binding domain of ER can lead to a ligand-independent, constitutively active form of ER and mediate resistance to aromatase inhibitors.ESR1 mutations may be detected by genomic sequencing of tissue biopsies of the metastatic tumor or by sequencing the circulating tumor cells or tumor DNA (ctDNA).Sequencing results may lead to a therapeutic \"match\" with an existing FDA-approved drug or match with an experimental agent that fits the clinical setting.",

These epidemiologic differences are in part accounted for by varying exposure to environmental risk factors such as tobacco, alcohol, high risk human papilloma viruses and betel quid. However, inherent genetic factors may also play an important role in this variability. As limited sequencing data is available for many populations, the involvement of unique genetic factors in HNSCC pathogenesis from epidemiologically diverse groups is unknown.

We genotyped the CYP2C19 gene which has been implicated in the metabolism of these drugs in an SCD patient cohort to determine the frequencies of reduced function, increased function, or complete loss-of-function variants.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: DNAs from 165 unrelated SCD patients were genotyped for nine CYP2C19 (*2, *3, *4, *5, *6, *7,*8, *12, and *17) alleles using the iPLEX\u00ae ADME PGx multiplex panel.\nRESULTS: Three CYP2C19 alleles (*2, *12, and *17) were detected with the following frequencies: 0.209, 0.006, and 0.236, respectively. The predicted phenotype frequencies were distributed as extensive (31.5%), intermediate (24.8%), poor (5.5%), ultrarapid (30.3%), and unknown metabolizers (7.9%).\nDISCUSSION: Prognostic genotyping is potentially useful for identifying SCD patients with allelic variants linked to proven clinical pharmacokinetic consequences for several drugs metabolized by the CYP2C19 gene.

They are considered a new class of endocrine regulators with promising potential as biomarkers.\nOBJECTIVE: Evaluation of circulating miRNA signatures in male and female subjects with idiopathic and postmenopausal osteoporotic low-traumatic fractures.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: This was a case-control study of cross-sectional design of 36 patients with prevalent low-traumatic fractures and 39 control subjects Main Outcome Measures: One hundred eighty-seven miRNAs were quantified in serum by qPCR, compared between groups and correlated with established bone turnover markers.\nRESULTS: Significant differences in serum levels of circulating miRNAs were identified in all three subgroups (46 in premenopausal, 52 in postmenopausal, 55 in male). A set of 19 miRNAs was consistently regulated in all three subgroups. Eight miRNAs [miR-152-3p, miR-30e-5p, miR-140-5p, miR-324-3p, miR-19b-3p, miR-335-5p, miR-19a-3p, miR-550a-3p] were excellent discriminators of patients with low-traumatic fractures, regardless of age and sex, with area under the curve values &gt; 0.9. The 11 remaining miRNAs showed area under the curve values between 0.81 and 0.89. Correlation analysis identified significant correlations between miR-29b-3p and P1NP, and miR-365-5p and iPTH, TRAP5b, P1NP and Osteocalcin, as well as BMD<sub>L1-L4</sub> and miR-19b-3p, miR-324-3p, miR-532-5p, and miR-93-5p.\nCONCLUSIONS: Specific serum miRNA profiles are strongly related to bone pathologies. Therefore miRNAs might be directly linked to bone tissue homeostasis. In particular, miR-29b-3p has previously been reported as regulator of osteogenic differentiation and could serve as a novel marker of bone turnover in osteoporotic patients as a member of a miRNA signature.",

        "abstract": "The molecular mechanism that regulates iron homeostasis is based on a network of signals, which reflect on the iron requirements of the body. Hereditary hemochromatosis is a heterogenic metabolic syndrome which is due to unchecked transfer of iron into the bloodstream and its toxic effects on parenchymatous organs. It is caused by the mutation of genes that encode proteins that help hepcidin to monitor serum iron. These proteins include the human hemochromatosis protein -HFE, transferrin-receptor 2, hemojuvelin in rare instances, and ferroportin. HFE-related hemochromatosis is the most frequent form of the disease. Interestingly, the low penetrance of polymorphic HFE genes results in rare clinical presentation of the disease, predominantly in middle-aged males. Taking into account the wide dispersion of HFE mutation in our population and also its unknown role in heterozygotes, we analyzed the impact of H63D HFE carriage in the developmental age, with respect to gender, on the iron status and hemoglobin concentration of carriers in comparison to those of wild-type HFE gene (12.7\u2009\u00b1\u20093.07\u00a0years, 42 boys and 41 girls). H63D carriers presented higher blood iron, transferrin saturation, and ferritin concentration than wild-type probands (p\u2009<\u20090.05.) Interestingly, male H63D carriers showed higher hemoglobin concentration than the unburdened children. Moreover, in the H63D carrier group, a positive correlation between iron and hemoglobin was noted. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that changes in iron metabolism occur at a young age in HFE heterozygotes.",

        "abstract": "The objective of this study was to determine how prenatal and postnatal dietary omega-3 fatty acids alter white blood cell (leukocyte) DNA methylation of offspring. Fifteen gilts (n\u00a0=\u00a05 per treatment) were selected from one of three treatments: (i) control diet throughout gestation, lactation and nursery phase (CON); (ii) algal omega-3 fatty acid supplementation enriched in EPA and DHA (Gromega\u2122 ) fed throughout gestation, lactation and nursery phase (Cn3); or (iii) Gromega\u2122 supplementation maternally, during gestation and lactation only, and control diet during the nursery phase (Mn3). At 11\u00a0weeks of age and after 8\u00a0weeks of post-weaning nursery feeding, buffy coat genomic DNA was subjected to methyl CpG binding protein sequencing. The methylation enriched profile mapped to 26% of the porcine genome. On chromosome 4, a 27.7-kb differentially methylated region downstream of RUNX1T1 was hypomethylated in the Mn3 and Cn3 groups by 91.6% and 85.0% respectively compared to CON pigs. Conversely, hypermethylation was detected in intergenic regions of chromosomes 4 and 12. Regulatory impact factor and differential hubbing methods were used to identify pathways that were coordinately regulated by methylation due to feeding EPA and DHA during pregnancy. Despite limited ability to detect differential methylation, we describe methods that allow the identification of coordinated epigenetic regulation that could not otherwise be detected from subtle single locus changes in methylation. These data provide evidence of novel epigenetic regulation by maternal and early life supplementation of omega-3 fatty acids that may have implications to growth and inflammatory processes.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) identifies fetal aneuploidy by sequencing cell-free DNA in the maternal plasma. Pre-symptomatic maternal malignancies have been incidentally detected during NIPT based on abnormal genomic profiles. This low coverage sequencing approach could have potential for ovarian cancer screening in the non-pregnant population. Our objective was to investigate whether plasma DNA sequencing with a clinical whole genome NIPT platform can detect early- and late-stage high-grade serous ovarian carcinomas (HGSOC).\nMETHODS: This is a case control study of prospectively-collected biobank samples comprising preoperative plasma from 32 women with HGSOC (16 'early cancer' (FIGO I-II) and 16 'advanced cancer' (FIGO III-IV)) and 32 benign controls. Plasma DNA from cases and controls were sequenced using a commercial NIPT platform and chromosome dosage measured. Sequencing data were blindly analyzed with two methods: (1) Subchromosomal changes were called using an open source algorithm WISECONDOR (WIthin-SamplE COpy Number aberration DetectOR). Genomic gains or losses\u2009\u2265\u200915\u00a0Mb were prespecified as \"screen positive\" calls, and mapped to recurrent copy number variations reported in an ovarian cancer genome atlas. (2) Selected whole chromosome gains or losses were reported using the routine NIPT pipeline for fetal aneuploidy.\nRESULTS: We detected 13/32 cancer cases using the subchromosomal analysis (sensitivity 40.6\u00a0%, 95\u00a0% CI, 23.7-59.4\u00a0%), including 6/16 early and 7/16 advanced HGSOC cases. Two of 32 benign controls had subchromosomal gains\u2009\u2265\u200915\u00a0Mb (specificity 93.8\u00a0%, 95\u00a0% CI, 79.2-99.2\u00a0%). Twelve of the 13 true positive cancer cases exhibited specific recurrent changes reported in HGSOC tumors. The NIPT pipeline resulted in one \"monosomy 18\" call from the cancer group, and two \"monosomy X\" calls in the controls.\nCONCLUSIONS: Low coverage plasma DNA sequencing used for prenatal testing detected 40.6\u00a0% of all HGSOC, including 38\u00a0% of early stage cases. Our findings demonstrate the potential of a high throughput sequencing platform to screen for early HGSOC in plasma based on characteristic multiple segmental chromosome gains and losses. The performance of this approach may be further improved by refining bioinformatics algorithms and targeting selected cancer copy number variations.",

        "abstract": "Y-chromosome markers are important tools for studying male-specific gene flow within and between populations, hybridization patterns and kinship. However, their use in non-human mammals is often hampered by the lack of Y-specific polymorphic markers. We identified new male-specific short tandem repeats (STRs) in Sus scrofa using the available genome sequence. We selected four polymorphic loci (5-10 alleles per locus), falling in one duplicated and two single-copy regions. A total of 32 haplotypes were found by screening 211 individuals from eight wild boar populations across Europe and five domestic pig populations. European wild boar were characterized by significantly higher levels of haplotype diversity compared to European domestic pigs (H<sub>D</sub> \u00a0=\u00a00.904\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.011 and H<sub>D</sub> \u00a0=\u00a00.491\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.077 respectively). Relationships among STR haplotypes were investigated by combining them with single nucleotide polymorphisms at two linked genes (AMELY and UTY) in a network analysis. A differentiation between wild and domestic populations was observed (F<sub>ST</sub> \u00a0=\u00a00.229), with commercial breeds sharing no Y haplotype with the sampled wild boar. Similarly, a certain degree of geographic differentiation was observed across Europe, with a number of local private haplotypes and high diversity in northern populations. The described Y-chromosome markers can be useful to track male inheritance and gene flow in wild and domestic populations, promising to provide insights into evolutionary and population genetics in Sus scrofa.",

        "abstract": "Centrioles are microtubule-based organelles found in most eukaryotic cells and that are critical for the formation of cilia and flagella, as well as of centrosomes in animal cells. The number of centrioles must be strictly regulated in proliferating cells in order to ensure genome integrity upon cell division. Despite their importance, however, the mechanisms governing centriole assembly and number control remain incompletely understood, owing in part to a paucity of available small-molecule compounds for dissection and alteration of the underlying processes. Here we have developed a chemical genetic approach to identify small-molecule compounds capable of modulating centriole numbers in human cells. High-throughput screening of \u22482600 natural compounds identified 14 candidate molecules that either diminish (ten compounds) or augment (four compounds) the number of centrioles per cell. We investigated the mechanisms of action of four of these compounds and discovered that two of them potentially reduce centriole number through effects on NF-\u03baB signalling. Moreover, we established that one further compound blocks cell cycle progression and probably indirectly causes an augmentation of centriole number. The last compound analysed induces, in addition to excess centrioles, exceptionally long primary cilia-like structures. Overall, our analysis demonstrates that natural products constitute a rich source of tool compounds useful for unravelling and manipulating the mechanisms governing centriole assembly and number control.",

        "abstract": "Crenate broomrape (Orobanche crenata Forsk.) is a devastating parasitic weed threatening the cultivation of legumes around the Mediterranean and in the Middle East. So far, only moderate levels of resistance were reported to occur in pea (Pisum sativum L.) natural germplasm, and most commercial cultivars are prone to severe infestation. Here, we describe the selection of a pea line highly resistant to O. crenata, following the screening of local genetic resources. Time series observations show that delayed emergence of the parasite is an important parameter associated with broomrape resistance. High performance liquid chromatography connected to tandem mass spectrometry analysis and in vitro broomrape germination bioassays suggest that the resistance mechanism might involve the reduced secretion of strigolactones, plant hormones exuded by roots and acting as signaling molecules for the germination of parasitic weeds. Two years of replicated trials in noninfested fields indicate that the resistance is devoid of pleiotropic effects on yield, in contrast to pea experimental mutants impaired in strigolactone biosynthesis and, thus, is suitable for use in breeding programs.",

Therefore, 44 women with breast cancer, where radiotherapy was part of their therapeutic protocol, were investigated in this study.

Due to limitations in radiologic imaging for the diagnosis of this condition, biopsy is a common method for diagnosis, which is invasive and holds potential complications. To identify alternative means for obtaining the diagnosis and assessing the prognosis of this condition, we evaluated biomarkers for biphenotypic HCC-CC using a genetic database.\nMETHODS: To evaluate the genetic associations with each variable we utilized GeneCards(\u00ae), The Human Gene Compendium (http://www.genecards.org). The results of our search were entered into the Pathway Interaction Database from the National Cancer Institute (PID-NCI) (http://pid.nci.nih.gov), to generate a biomolecule interaction map.\nRESULTS: The results of our query yielded 690 genes for HCC, 98 genes for CC and 50 genes for HCC-CC. Genes depicted in this analysis demonstrate the role of hormonal regulation, embryonic development, cell surface adhesion, cytokeratin stability, mucin production, metalloproteinase regulation, Ras signaling, metabolism and apoptosis. Examples of previously described markers included hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), mesenchymal epithelial transition (MET) and Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS). Novel markers included phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA), GPC3, choline kinase alpha (CHKA), prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2), telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL1) and N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2).\nCONCLUSIONS: GeneCards is a useful research tool in the genetic analysis of low frequency malignancies. Utilizing this tool we identified several biomarkers are methods for diagnosing HCC-CC. Finally, utilizing these methods, HCC-CC was found to be predominantly a subtype of CC.",

This review aimed to summarize currently reported findings on the clinical implications of KRAS mutant (mut-KRAS) status for patients with CRLM.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: The Pubmed database was searched for relevant articles published from 01/01/2010 to 02/01/2016. Overall survival (OS) and recurrence free survival (RFS) as well as patterns of recurrence were the primary endpoints, but consideration was given to secondary outcomes when the respective findings were of clinical interest.\nRESULTS: Out of the 266 studies screened, 15 were included in our review. Fourteen studies were retrospective cohorts while one was a systematic review/meta-analysis. Among the 14 retrospective studies, 12 reported OS with 9 detecting a negative association with mut-KRAS status. Similarly, 11 out of 14 retrospective cohorts reported RFS with 6 detecting a negative association with mut-KRAS status. Five studies examined patterns of recurrence, with 4 detecting increased extrahepatic recurrence in the mut-KRAS group. One study examined the different effects of codon-specific KRAS mutations on prognosis.\nCONCLUSION: mut-KRAS status predisposes to worse RFS and OS in patients with CRLM, possibly as a result of aggressive tumor biology. Early unresectable extrahepatic recurrence is more frequent in this patient group and may underlie the unfavorable prognosis. Future research should focus on characterizing the distinct effects of codon-specific KRAS mutations as well their interplay with other less common genetic mutations.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND/AIM: To date, the conventional formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) technique is the gold-standard for preserving histomorphology. Once FFPE tissues are stained, slides are routinely archived along with their blocks at biobanks/hospitals. However, the reuse of fixed and stained biospecimens as DNA source is not a common routine practice worldwide and, thus, indicates the need of studies to investigate the feasibility of extracting DNA from already immunohistochemistry (IHC) FFPE-stained slides and its possible reuse in subsequent downstream molecular analyses.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: FFPE IHC slides from colorectal cancer (CRC) patients were prepared and stored in the CEGMR Biobank. The workflow consists of digitalization of IHC stained slide's image, removing the slide cover-slip, crude dissection and DNA extraction. Following DNA quality assessment, mutation analysis of CTNNB1 and methylation profile of CDH1 were performed.\nRESULTS: High-quality DNA was obtained allowing 60% concordance between CDH1 methylation and membranous E-cadherin expression pattern. Clean CTNNB1 DNA chromatograms with evenly-spaced peaks were observed.\nCONCLUSION: This study is a proof of concept to recycle and reuse DNA from IHC stained slides with suitable concentration and integrity for further downstream molecular applications. These findings will enhance the pathologists' knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) towards the use of these biospecimens and support the implementation of this approach in clinical pathology practice. Therefore, the scientific community will benefit from the largest comprehensive database of human fully annotated FFPE biospecimens already available at their disposal in order to demystify the complexity and the heterogeneity of many challenging diseases and foster the transition towards precision medicine.",

        "abstract": "Control of lipid levels is one of the most effective strategies for cardiovascular (CV) event prevention. In fact, many clinical trials have clearly demonstrated that low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering, primarily with statins, reduces major CV events and mortality. The evidence from these trials has been useful in designing the cholesterol treatment guidelines, which are mainly aimed at preventing and managing cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, available data indicate that a large proportion of patients fail to achieve lipid goals, and this is particularly frequent in patients at high or very high CV risk. Furthermore, owing to side effects, a significant percentage of patients cannot tolerate statin treatment. Hence, researchers have focused their attention on novel LDL-C-lowering agents that act via mechanisms distinct from that of statins. Among the new compounds under investigation, the monoclonal antibodies to proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) seem particularly promising, having recently been shown to be well tolerated and highly effective at lowering LDL-C, with a possible effect on the occurrence of CV events. Currently, alirocumab is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as an adjunct to diet and maximally tolerated statin therapy for use in adults with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) or those with atherosclerotic CV disease who require additional LDL-C lowering; it has also been recently approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for use in patients with heterozygous FH, non-familial hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia in whom statins are ineffective or not tolerated. Evolocumab is approved by the FDA as an adjunct to diet and maximally tolerated statins for adults with hetero- and homozygous FH and those with atherosclerotic CV disease who require additional lowering of LDL-C, and by the EMA in adults with primary hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia, as an adjunct to diet, in combination with a statin or a statin with other lipid lowering therapies in patients unable to reach LDL-C goals with the maximum tolerated dose of a statin; alone or in combination with other lipid lowering therapies in patients who are statin-intolerant, or those for whom a statin is contraindicated. Evolocumab is also indicated in adults and adolescents aged 12\u00a0years and over with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia in combination with other lipid-lowering therapies.",

In addition to the traditional CRC biomarkers, the persistent presence of posttherapeutic CTCs indicates resistance to adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy; hence, CTCs also play a decisive role in the subsequent relapse of CRC. Moreover, the genetic and phenotypic profiling of CTCs often differs from that of the primary tumor; this difference can be used to select the most effective targeted therapy. Consequently, studying CTCs can potentially individualize treatment strategies for patients with CRC.

Cases of FH were identified by applying DLCN score. Two further algorithms, based on either ICD9CM coding for FH or some clinical items adopted by the DLCN, were tested towards DLCN itself as gold standard.\nRESULTS: We estimated a prevalence of 0.01% for \"definite\" and 0.18% for \"definite\" plus \"probable\" cases as per the DLCN. Algorithms 1 and 2 reported a FH prevalence of 0.9 and 0.13%, respectively. Both algorithms resulted in consistent specificity (1: 99.10%; 2: 99.9%) towards DLCN, but Algorithm 2 considerably better identified true positive (sensitivity=85.90%) than Algorithm 1 (sensitivity=10.10%).\nCONCLUSION: The application of DLCN or valid diagnostic alternatives in the Italian primary care setting provides estimates of FH prevalence consistent with those reported in other screening studies in Caucasian population. These diagnostic criteria should be therefore fostered among GPs. In the perspective of FH new therapeutic options, the epidemiological picture of FH is even more relevant to foresee the costs and to plan affordable reimbursement programs in Italy.",

All tissue was re-reviewed in blinded fashion by genitourinary pathologists using 2005 ISUP (International Society of Urological Pathology) Gleason grading criteria. A previously validated Decipher\u00ae metastasis signature was calculated in each case based on a locked model. To compare patient characteristics across pathological Gleason score categories we used the Fisher exact test or the ANOVA F test. The distribution of Decipher scores among different clinicopathological groups was compared with the Wilcoxon rank sum test. The association of Decipher score with adverse pathology features was examined using logistic regression models. The significance level of all statistical tests was 0.05.\nRESULTS: Of men with Gleason 3 + 3 = 6 disease only 269 (80%) had a low Decipher score with intermediate and high scores in 43 (13%) and 25 (7%), respectively. Decipher scores were significantly higher among pathological Gleason 3 + 3 = 6 specimens from cases with adverse pathological features such as extraprostatic extension, seminal vesicle involvement or positive margins (p\u00a0<0.001).

A total of 415 AAD subjects from the United Kingdom cohort were compared with 8 180 180 United Kingdom births, and 231 AAD subjects from the Polish cohort were compared with 2 421 384 Polish births.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Association between month of birth and the susceptibility to AAD.\nRESULTS: In the entire cohort of AAD subjects, month-of-birth distribution analysis showed significant periodicity with peak of births in December and trough in May (P = .028). Analysis of the odds ratio distribution based on month of birth in 2 cohorts of patients with AAD versus the general population revealed a December peak and May trough, and January peak and July trough, in the United Kingdom and Polish cohorts, respectively.\nCONCLUSION: For the first time, we demonstrate that month of birth exerts an effect on the risk of developing AAD, with excess risk in individuals born in winter months and a protective effect when born in the summer. Exposure to seasonal viral infections in the perinatal period, coupled with vitamin D deficiency, could lead to dysregulation of innate immunity affecting the risk of developing AAD.",

        "abstract": "Lung cancer is the primary reason for death due to cancer worldwide, and non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common subtype of lung cancer. Most patients die from complications of NSCLC due to poor diagnosis. In this paper, we aimed to predict gene biomarkers that may be of use for diagnosis of NSCLC by integrating differential gene expression analysis with functional association network analysis. We first constructed an NSCLC-specific functional association network by combining gene expression correlation with functional association. Then, we applied a network partition algorithm to divide the network into gene modules and identify the most NSCLC-specific gene modules based on their differential expression pattern in between normal and NSCLC samples. Finally, from these modules, we identified genes that exhibited the most impact on the expression of their functionally associated genes in between normal and NSCLC samples and predicted them as NSCLC biomarkers. Literature review of the top predicted gene biomarkers suggested that most of them were already considered critical for development of NSCLC.",

        "abstract": "The tenascin-X (TNX) deficient type Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) is similar to the classical type of EDS. Because of the limited awareness among geneticists and the challenge of the molecular analysis of the TNXB gene, the TNX-deficient type EDS is probably to be under diagnosed. We therefore performed an observational, cross-sectional study. History and physical examination were performed. Results of serum TNX measurements were collected and mutation analysis was performed by a combination of next-generation sequencing (NGS), Sanger sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). Included were 17 patients of 11 families with autosomal recessive inheritance and childhood onset. All patients had hyperextensible skin without atrophic scarring. Hypermobility of the joints was observed in 16 of 17 patients. Deformities of the hands and feet were observed frequently. TNX serum level was tested and absent in 11 patients (seven families). Genetic testing was performed in all families; 12 different mutations were detected, most of which are suspected to lead to non-sense mRNA mediated decay. In short, patients with the TNX-deficient type EDS typically have generalized joint hypermobility, skin hyperextensibility and easy bruising. In contrast to the classical type, the inheritance pattern is autosomal recessive and atrophic scarring is absent. Molecular analysis of TNXB in a diagnostic setting is challenging.",

GRS-T2D showed weaker contribution to fasting glucose and DI compared to GRS-\u03b2, in both obese and normal-weight youths. GRS associated with insulin resistance and GRS associated with body mass index did not associate with any traits. None of the GRSs associated with prediabetes, which affected only 4% of participants overall.\nCONCLUSION: Single nucleotide polymorphisms identified by genome-wide association studies to influence beta-cell function were associated with fasting glucose and indices of insulin secretion in youths, especially in obese children.",

        "abstract": "Preaxial polydactyly (PPD; OMIM 603596), which is characterized as having supernumerary fingers, is an unusual congenital hand abnormality. Triphalangeal thumb (TPT; OMIM 190600) is identified by an extra phalangeal bone and is often found in association with PPD. When in combination, the disease is referred to as PPD type II (PPD II; OMIM 174500). Previous studies have demonstrated that variations in the zone of polarizing activity regulatory sequence (ZRS; chr7:156,583,796-156,584,569; hg19) region are associated with PPD II. In this study, our patient was diagnosed with PPD II, having bilateral thumb duplication and unilateral TPT (on the right hand). Further investigation of possible causative genes identified a de novo heterozygous ZRS mutation (ZRS 428T>A). This novel mutation was neither found in 200 normal controls nor reported in online databases. Moreover, the bioinformatics program Genomic Evolutionary Rate Profiling (GERP) revealed this site (ZRS428) to be evolutionarily highly conserved, and the 428T>A point mutation was predicted to be deleterious by MutationTaster. In conclusion, the affected individual shows bilateral thumb duplication, but unilateral TPT making this case special. Thus, our findings not only further support the important role of ZRS in limb morphogenesis and expand the spectrum of ZRS mutations, but also emphasize the significance of genetic diagnosis and counseling of families with digit number and identity alterations as well.",

        "abstract": "As recognised by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Precision Medicine Initiative (PMI), microarray technology currently provides a rapid, inexpensive means of identifying large numbers of known genomic variants or gene transcripts in experimental and clinical settings. However new generation sequencing techniques are now being introduced in many clinical genetic contexts, particularly where novel mutations are involved. While these methods can be valuable for screening a restricted set of genes for known or novel mutations, implementation of whole genome sequencing in clinical practice continues to present challenges. Even very accurate high-throughput methods with small error rates can generate large numbers of false negative or false positive errors due to the high numbers of simultaneous readings. Additional validation is likely to be required for safe use of any such methods in clinical settings. Custom-designed arrays can offer advantages for screening for common, known mutations and, in this context, may currently be better suited for accredited, quality-controlled clinical genetic screening services, as illustrated by their successful application in several large-scale pre-emptive pharmacogenomics programs now underway. Excessive, inappropriate use of next-generation sequencing may waste scarce research funds and other resources. Microarrays presently remain the technology of choice in applications that require fast, cost-effective genome-wide screening of variants of known importance, particularly for large sample sizes.

Sphyrna tiburo is currently described as one continuously distributed species along the Atlantic continental margins of North, Central and South America, but recent genetic analysis of an insular population (Trinidad) suggests the possibility of cryptic speciation. To address this issue S. tiburo were sampled at six sites along c. 6200 km of continuous, continental coastline and from one island location (Grand Bahama) across a discontinuity in their distribution (the Straits of Florida), in order to test if they constitute a single lineage over this distribution. A total of 1030 bp of the mitochondrial control region (CR) was obtained for 239 S. tiburo, revealing 73 distinct haplotypes, high nucleotide diversity (0\u00b701089) and a pair of highly divergent lineages estimated to have separated 3\u00b761-5\u00b762 million years ago. Mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I and nuclear internal transcribed spacer loci show the same pattern. Divergence is similar within S. tiburo to that observed between established elasmobranch sister species, providing further evidence of cryptic speciation. A global AMOVA based on CR confirms that genetic diversity is primarily partitioned among populations (\u03a6<sub>ST</sub> = 0\u00b7828, P &lt; 0\u00b7001) because the divergent lineages are almost perfectly segregated between Belize and North America-The Bahamas. An AMOVA consisting solely of the North American and Bahamian samples is also significantly different from zero (\u03a6<sub>ST</sub> = 0\u00b7088, P &lt; 0\u00b7001) and pairwise F<sub>ST</sub> is significantly different between all sites.

Located in a high-transmission region of western Kenya where P. falciparum is the predominant species, the Lake Victoria islands are ideal for feasibility of malaria elimination studies. We analyzed genetic variation in eight microsatellite loci to examine parasite population structure and gene flow patterns across five sites. High levels of genetic diversity were measured throughout the region (mean heterozygosity index = 0.84). The overall fixation index value between the sites was 0.044, indicating that approximately 5% of the overall allelic variation is due to differences between the populations. Based on these results, we concluded that parasite population structure in the studied islands is shaped by human migration patterns that maintain extensive parasite gene flow between the sites. Consequently, any malaria elimination and interventions strategies in the study area will have to be carried out broadly on all four islands and adjoining mainland region.",

This probably had a dual source in the growing strength of evolutionary biology and the new international interest in understanding the effects of radiation on human populations, following the atomic bombings in Japan. These global concerns were shared by Mexican physicians. Indeed, Mexico was one of the leading centers of this trend in human genetics. Three leading players in this story were Mario Salazar Mall\u00e9n, Adolfo Karl, and Rub\u00e9n Lisker. Their trajectories and the international networks in human genetics that were established after WWII, paved the way for the establishment of medical and population genetics in Mexico. Salazar Mall\u00e9n's studies on the distribution and characterization of ABO blood groups in indigenous populations were the starting point while Karl's studies on the distribution of abnormal hemoglobin in Mexican indigenous populations showed the relationships observed in other laboratories at the time. It was Lisker's studies, however, that were instrumental in the development of population genetics in the context of national public policies for extending health care services to the Mexican population. In particular, he conducted studies on Mexican indigenous groups contributing to the knowledge of the biological diversity of human populations according to international trends that focused on the variability of human populations in terms of genetic frequencies. From the start, however, Lisker was as committed to the reconstruction of shared languages and practices as he was to building networks of collaboration in order to guarantee the necessary groundwork for establishing the study of the genetics of human populations in Mexico. This study also allows us to place Mexican science within a global context in which connected narratives describe the interplay between global trends and national contexts.",

        "abstract": "N-acyl-homoserine lactones (AHL) are the quorum-sensing (QS) signal molecules used by many gram-negative bacteria to coordinate their collective behavior in a population. Recent evidence demonstrates their roles in plant root growth and defense responses. AtMYB44 is a multifaceted transcriptional factor that functions in many physiological processes in plants but whether AtMYB44 modulates the plant response to AHL with aspects of primary root elongation remains unknown. Here, we show that the expression of AtMYB44 was upregulated upon treatment with N-3-oxo-hexanoyl-homoserine lactone (3OC6-HSL). The stimulatory effect of 3OC6-HSL on primary root elongation was abolished in the AtMYB44 functional-deficiency mutant atmby44. In contrast, an enhanced promoting-impact of 3OC6-HSL on primary root growth was observed in AtMYB44-overexpressing plant MYB44OTA. Cellular analysis indicated that the prolonged primary root elicited by 3OC6-HSL is the consequence of increased cell division in the meristem zone and enhanced cell elongation in the elongation zone, and AtMYB44 may act as a positive regulator in this process. Furthermore, we demonstrated that AtMYB44 might participate in the 3OC6-HSL-mediated primary root growth via regulating the expression of cytokinin- and auxin-related genes. The data establish a genetic connection between the regulatory role of AtMYB44 in phytohormones-related gene expression and plant response to the bacterial QS signal.",

Here we focus on cell density to determine its role in collective migration. Our findings show that increasing cell density, as might be seen in cancer, transforms groups from broad collectives to small, narrow streams. Conversely, diminishing cell density, as might occur at a wound front, leads to large, broad collectives with a distinct leader-follower structure. Simulations identify force-sensitive contractility as a mediator of how density affects collectives, and guided by this prediction, we find that the baseline state of contractility can enhance or reduce organization. Finally, we test predictions from these data in an in vivo epithelium by using genetic manipulations to drive collective motion between predicted migratory phases. This work demonstrates how commonly altered cellular properties can prime groups of cells to adopt migration patterns that may be harnessed in health or exploited in disease.",

        "abstract": "The cardiotoxicity of certain chemotherapeutic agents is now well-established, and has led to the development of the field of cardio-oncology, increased cardiac screening of cancer patients, and limitation of patients' maximum cumulative chemotherapeutic dose. The effect of chemotherapeutic regimes on the heart largely involves cardiomyocyte death, leading to cardiomyopathy and heart failure, or the induction of arrhythmias. Of these cardiotoxic drugs, those resulting in clinical cardiotoxicity can range from 8 to 26% for doxorubicin, 7-28% for trastuzumab, or 5-30% for paclitaxel. For tyrosine kinase inhibitors, QT prolongation and arrhythmia, ischemia and hypertension have been reported in 2-35% of patients. Furthermore, newly introduced chemotherapeutic agents are commonly used as part of changed combinational regimens with significantly increased incidence of cardiotoxicity. It is widely believed that the mechanism of action of these drugs is often independent of their cardiotoxicity, and the basis for why these drugs specifically affect the heart has yet to be established. The genetic rationale for why certain patients experience cardiotoxicity whilst other patients can tolerate high chemotherapy doses has proven highly illusive. This has led to significant genomic efforts using targeted and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to divine the pharmacogenomic cause of this predilection. With the advent of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs), the putative risk and protective role of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can now be validated in a human model. Here we review the state of the art knowledge of the genetic predilection to chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity and discuss the future for establishing and validating the role of the genome in this disease.",

        "abstract": "STUDY QUESTION: Does mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) diversity in modern human populations potentially pose a challenge, via mtDNA segregation, to mitochondrial replacement therapies?\nSUMMARY ANSWER: The magnitude of mtDNA diversity in modern human populations is as high as in mammalian model systems where strong mtDNA segregation is observed; consideration of haplotype pairs and/or haplotype matching can help avoid these potentially deleterious effects.\nWHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: In mammalian models, substantial proliferative differences are observed between different mtDNA haplotypes in cellular admixtures, with larger proliferative differences arising from more diverse haplotype pairings. If maternal mtDNA is 'carried over' in human gene therapies, these proliferative differences could lead to its amplification in the resulting offspring, potentially leading to manifestation of the disease that the therapy was designed to avoid-but existing studies have not investigated whether mtDNA diversity in modern human populations is sufficient to permit significant amplification.\nSTUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This theoretical study used over 7500 human mtDNA sequences from The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), a range of international and British mtDNA surveys, and 2011 census data.\nPARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: A stochastic simulation approach was used to model random haplotype pairings from within different regions. In total, 1000 simulated pairings were analysed using the basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) for each region. Previous data from mouse models were used to estimate proliferative differences.\nMAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Even within the same haplogroup, differences of around 20-80 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are common between mtDNAs admixed in random pairings. These values are sufficient to lead to substantial segregation in mouse models over an organismal lifetime, even given low starting heteroplasmy, inducing increases from 5% to 35% over 1 year. Substantial population mixing in modern UK cities increases the expected genetic differences. Hence, the likely genetic differences between humans randomly sampled from a population may well allow substantial amplification of a disease-carrying mtDNA haplotype over the timescale of a human lifetime. We report ranges and mean differences for all statistics to quantify uncertainty in our results.\nLIMITATIONS/REASONS FOR CAUTION: The mapping from mouse and other mammalian models to the human system is challenging, as timescales and mechanisms may differ. Reporting biases in NCBI mtDNA data, if present, may affect the statistics we compute. We discuss the robustness of our findings in the light of these concerns.\nWIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Matching the mtDNA haplotypes of the mother and third-party donor in mitochondrial replacement therapies is supported as a means of ameliorating the potentially deleterious results of human mtDNA diversity. We present a chart of expected SNP differences between mtDNA haplogroups, allowing the selection of optimal partners for therapies.\nLARGE SCALE DATA: N/A STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTERESTS: The authors report no external funding sources or conflicts of interest.",

Patients with genotype TT/CT had a significant lower level of ATG16L2 mRNA than patients with genotype CC (0.0036\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.0016 vs 0.0053\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.0028, P\u00a0=\u00a00.005).\nCONCLUSIONS: ATG16L2 is a susceptibility gene for CD in the Chinese population. The rs11235604 SNP is remarkably associated with downregulation of the expression of ATG16L2. Further investigation into the gene's function is warranted for a comprehensive knowledge of the contribution of the variant to the development of CD.",

        "abstract": "Increasing knowledge about the influence of genetic variation on human health and growing availability of reliable, cost-effective genetic testing have spurred the implementation of genomic medicine in the clinic. As defined by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), genomic medicine uses an individual's genetic information in his or her clinical care, and has begun to be applied effectively in areas such as cancer genomics, pharmacogenomics, and rare and undiagnosed diseases. In 2011 NHGRI published its strategic vision for the future of genomic research, including an ambitious research agenda to facilitate and promote the implementation of genomic medicine. To realize this agenda, NHGRI is consulting and facilitating collaborations with the external research community through a series of \"Genomic Medicine Meetings,\" under the guidance and leadership of the National Advisory Council on Human Genome Research. These meetings have identified and begun to address significant obstacles to implementation, such as lack of evidence of efficacy, limited availability of genomics expertise and testing, lack of standards, and difficulties in integrating genomic results into electronic medical records. The six research and dissemination initiatives comprising NHGRI's genomic research portfolio are designed to speed the evaluation and incorporation, where appropriate, of genomic technologies and findings into routine clinical care. Actual adoption of successful approaches in clinical care will depend upon the willingness, interest, and energy of professional societies, practitioners, patients, and payers to promote their responsible use and share their experiences in doing so.",

The Microbiome Project has made great strides in sequencing the microbiome and identifying the vast communities of microorganisms that inhabit our bodies and much work continues to examine the individual contribution of bacteria on health and disease to inform future therapies. This review explores the current literature outlining the contribution of important bacteria on reproductive health among sexually active men and women, outlines gaps in current research to determine causal and interventional relationships, and suggests future research initiatives. Novel treatments options to reduce adverse outcomes must recognize the heterogeneity of the bacteria within the microbiome and adequately assess long-term benefits in reducing disease burden and re-establishing a healthy Lactobacillus-dominant state. Recognizing other reservoirs outside of the lower genital track and within sexual partners as well as genetic and individual moderators may be most important for long-term cure and reduction of disease. It will be important to develop useful screening tools and comprehensively examine novel therapeutic options to promote the long-term reduction of high-risk bacteria and the re-establishment of healthy bacterial levels to considerably improve outcomes among pregnant women and sexually active men and women.",

        "abstract": "Although relatively rare, inherited primitive cardiac disorders (IPCDs) in athletes have a deep social impact since they often present as sudden cardiac death (SCD) of young and otherwise healthy persons. The diagnosis of these conditions is likely underestimated due to the lack of shared clinical criteria and to the existence of several borderline clinical pictures. We will focus on the clinical and molecular diagnosis of the most common IPCDs, namely hypertrophic cardiomyopathies, long QT syndrome, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, and left ventricular non-compaction. Collectively, these conditions account for the majority of SCD episodes and/or cardiologic clinical problems in athletes. In addition to the clinical and instrumental tools for the diagnosis of IPCD, the viral technological advances in genetic testing have facilitated the molecular confirmation of these conditions. However, genetic testing presents several issues: the limited sensitivity (globally, around 50%), the low prognostic predictive value, the probability to find pathogenic variants in different genes in the same patient, and the risk of non-interpretable results. In this review, we will analyze the pros and cons of the different clinical approaches for the presymptomatic identification, the diagnosis and management of IPCD athletes, and we will discuss the indications to the genetic testing for patients and their relatives, particularly focusing on the most complex scenarios, such as presymptomatic tests, uncertain results, and unexpected findings.",

PRDM9 has been identified as the gene responsible for specifying the location of recombination hotspots during meiosis and is also the only known vertebrate gene associated with reproductive isolation between species. PRDM9 encodes a protein with a highly variable zinc finger (ZF) domain that varies between as well as within species. In the present study, the ZF domain of PRDM9 on chromosome 1 was characterized for the first time in 15 goat breeds and 25 sheep breeds of India. A remarkable variation in the number and sequence of ZF domains was observed. The number of ZF repeats in the ZF array varied from eight to 12 yielding five homozygous and 10 heterozygous genotypes. The number of different ZF domains was 84 and 52 producing 36 and 26 unique alleles in goats and sheep respectively. The posterior mean of dN/dS or omega values were calculated using the codeml tool of pamlx to identify amino acids that are evolving positively in goats and sheep, as positions -1, +3 and +6 in the ZF domain have been reported to experience strong positive selection across different lineages. Our study identified sites -5, -1, +3, +4 and +6 to be experiencing positive selection. Small ruminant zinc fingers were also found to be evolving under concerted evolution.

        "abstract": "Obesity is associated with metabolic tissue infiltration by monocyte-derived macrophages. Saturated fatty acids contribute to proinflammatory gene induction in tissue-embedded immune cells. However, it is unknown how circulating monocytes, the macrophage precursors, react to high-fat environments. In macrophages, saturated fatty acids activate inflammatory pathways and, notably, prime caspase-associated inflammasomes. Inflammasome-activated IL-1\u03b2 contributes to type 2 diabetes. We hypothesized that 1) human monocytes from obese patients show caspase activation, and 2) fatty acids trigger this response and consequent release of IL-1\u03b2/IL-18. Human peripheral blood monocytes were sorted by flow cytometry, and caspase activity was measured with a FLICA dye-based assay. Blood monocytes from obese individuals exhibited elevated caspase activity. To explore the nature and consequence of this activity, human THP1 monocytes were exposed to saturated or unsaturated fatty acids. Caspase activity was revealed by isoform-specific cleavage and enzymatic activity; cytokine expression/release was measured by qPCR and ELISA. Palmitate, but not palmitoleate, increased caspase activity in parallel to the release of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18. Palmitate induced eventual monocyte cell death with features of pyroptosis (an inflammation-linked cell death program involving caspase-4/5), scored through LDH release, vital dye influx, cell volume changes, and nuclear morphology. Notably, selective gene silencing or inhibition of caspase-4/5 reduced palmitate-induced release of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18. In summary, monocytes from obese individuals present elevated caspase activity. Mechanistically, palmitate activates a pyroptotic program in monocytes through caspase-4/5, causing inflammatory cytokine release, additional to inflammasomes. These caspases represent potential, novel, therapeutic targets to taper obesity-associated inflammation.",

Since the first description of the syndrome >20 years ago, considerable advances have been made in our understanding of the underlying mechanisms involved and the strategies to stratify at-risk patients. The development of repolarization-depolarization abnormalities in patients with Brugada syndrome can involve genetic alterations, abnormal neural crest cell migration, improper gap junctional communication, or connexome abnormalities. A common phenotype observed on the electrocardiogram of patients with Brugada syndrome might be the result of different pathophysiological mechanisms. Furthermore, risk stratification of this patient cohort is critical, and although some risk factors for Brugada syndrome have been frequently reported, several others remain unconfirmed. Current clinical guidelines offer recommendations for patients at high risk of developing sudden cardiac death, but the management of those at low risk has not yet been defined. In this Review, we discuss the proposed mechanisms that underlie the development of Brugada syndrome and the current risk stratification and therapeutic options available for these patients.",

        "abstract": "Mammalian cells have developed intricate mechanisms to interpret, integrate, and respond to extracellular stimuli. For example, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) rapidly activates proinflammatory genes, but our understanding of how this occurs against the ongoing transcriptional program of the cell is far from complete. Here, we monitor the early phase of this cascade at high spatiotemporal resolution in TNF-stimulated human endothelial cells. NF-\u03baB, the transcription factor complex driving the response, interferes with the regulatory machinery by binding active enhancers already in interaction with gene promoters. Notably, >50% of these enhancers do not encode canonical NF-\u03baB binding motifs. Using a combination of genomics tools, we find that binding site selection plays a key role in NF-\u03ba\u0392-mediated transcriptional activation and repression. We demonstrate the latter by describing the synergy between NF-\u03ba\u0392 and the corepressor JDP2. Finally, detailed analysis of a 2.8-Mbp locus using sub-kbp-resolution targeted chromatin conformation capture and genome editing uncovers how NF-\u03ba\u0392 that has just entered the nucleus exploits pre-existing chromatin looping to exert its multimodal role. This work highlights the involvement of topology in cis-regulatory element function during acute transcriptional responses, where primary DNA sequence and its higher-order structure constitute a regulatory context leading to either gene activation or repression.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: To evaluate the combination of a pressure-indicating sensor film with hydrogel-forming microneedle arrays, as a method of feedback to confirm MN insertion in vivo.\nMETHODS: Pilot in vitro insertion studies were conducted using a Texture Analyser to insert MN arrays, coupled with a pressure-indicating sensor film, at varying forces into excised neonatal porcine skin. In vivo studies involved twenty human volunteers, who self-applied two hydrogel-forming MN arrays, one with a pressure-indicating sensor film incorporated and one without. Optical coherence tomography was employed to measure the resulting penetration depth and colorimetric analysis to investigate the associated colour change of the pressure-indicating sensor film.\nRESULTS: Microneedle insertion was achieved in vitro at three different forces, demonstrating the colour change of the pressure-indicating sensor film upon application of increasing pressure. When self-applied in vivo, there was no significant difference in the microneedle penetration depth resulting from each type of array, with a mean depth of 237\u00a0\u03bcm recorded. When the pressure-indicating sensor film was present, a colour change occurred upon each application, providing evidence of insertion.\nCONCLUSIONS: For the first time, this study shows how the incorporation of a simple, low-cost pressure-indicating sensor film can indicate microneedle insertion in vitro and in vivo, providing visual feedback to assure the user of correct application. Such a strategy may enhance usability of a microneedle device and, hence, assist in the future translation of the technology to widespread clinical use.",

However, CXCL4L1 is also expressed in patient tumors, tumor cell lines, and murine xenografts, prompting a more detailed analysis of its role in cancer pathogenesis. We used genetic and antibody-based approaches to attenuate CXCL4L1 in models of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Mechanisms of expression were assessed in cell coculture experiments, murine, and avian xenotransplants, including through an evaluation of CpG methylation and mutation of critical CpG residues. CXCL4L1 gene expression was increased greatly in primary and metastatic PDAC. We found that myofibroblasts triggered cues in the tumor microenvironment, which led to induction of CXCL4L1 in tumor cells. CXCL4L1 expression was also controlled by epigenetic modifications at critical CpG islands, which were mapped. CXCL4L1 inhibited angiogenesis but also affected tumor development more directly, depending on the tumor cell type. In vivo administration of an mAb against CXCL4L1 demonstrated a blockade in the growth of tumors positive for CXCR3, a critical receptor for CXCL4 ligands. Our findings define a protumorigenic role in PDAC development for endogenous CXCL4L1, which is independent of its antiangiogenic function. Cancer Res; 76(22); 6507-19. \u00a92016 AACR.",

Next-generation sequencing of cancer genomes and epigenomes has defined large numbers of driver mutations and molecular subgroups, leading to therapeutic advances. By comparison, there is a relative paucity of such knowledge in premalignant neoplasia, which inherently limits the potential to develop precision prevention strategies. Studies on the interplay between germ-line and somatic events have elucidated genetic processes underlying premalignant progression and preventive targets. Emerging data hint at the immune system's ability to intercept premalignancy and prevent cancer. Genetically engineered mouse models have identified mechanisms by which genetic drivers and other somatic alterations recruit inflammatory cells and induce changes in normal cells to create and interact with the premalignant tumor microenvironment to promote oncogenesis and immune evasion. These studies are currently limited to only a few lesion types and patients. In this Perspective, we advocate a large-scale collaborative effort to systematically map the biology of premalignancy and the surrounding cellular response. By bringing together scientists from diverse disciplines (e.g., biochemistry, omics, and computational biology; microbiology, immunology, and medical genetics; engineering, imaging, and synthetic chemistry; and implementation science), we can drive a concerted effort focused on cancer vaccines to reprogram the immune response to prevent, detect, and reject premalignancy. Lynch syndrome, clonal hematopoiesis, and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia which also serve as models for inherited syndromes, blood, and viral premalignancies, are ideal scenarios in which to launch this initiative.",

Chemotherapy outcome for breast cancer is hampered due to poor response and irreversible dose-dependent cardiotoxicity which is determined by genetic variations in drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters. Pregnane X receptor (PXR), a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, induces expression of drug metabolizing enzymes (DMEs) and transporters leading to regulation of xenobiotic metabolism.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: A genomic region spanning PXR 3' UTR was amplified and sequenced using genomic DNA isolated from 96 South Indian breast cancer patients. Genetic variants observed in our study subjects were queried in miRSNP to establish SNPs that alter miRNA binding sites in PXR 3' UTR. In addition, enrichment analysis was carried out to understand the network of miRNAs and PXR in drug metabolism using DIANA miRpath and miRwalk pathway prediction tools.\nRESULTS: In this study, we identified SNPs rs3732359, rs3732360, rs1054190, rs1054191 and rs6438550 in the PXR 3; UTR region. The SNPs rs3732360, rs1054190 and rs1054191 were located in the binding site of miR-500a-3p, miR-532-3p and miR-374a-3p resulting in the altered PXR level due to the deregulation of post-transcriptional control and this leads to poor treatment response and toxicity.\nCONCLUSIONS: Genetic variants identified in PXR 3' UTR and their effects on PXR levels through post-transcriptional regulation provide a genetic basis for inter- individual variability in treatment response and toxicity associated with chemotherapy.",

Diagnostic methods include polymerase chain reaction performed in blood samples during infection, and in urine and saliva. Pregnant women undergo antibody testing for immunoglobulin M. Treatment involves supportive care, and acetaminophen and antihistamines to control symptoms.\nCONCLUSIONS: Although there was no evidence of the circulation of ZIKV in the Western hemisphere prior to 2014, the global spread of Stegomyia aegypti and increases in urban populations and international travel have fostered its evolution. Adherence to current guidelines for the prevention of ZIKV transmission is especially relevant in regions experiencing ongoing outbreaks. Concern for microcephaly in newborns warrants further investigation into the potential long-term effects of ZIKV infection, especially in relation to reproductive health and mother-fetus transmission.",

        "title": "A Recurrent ERCC3 Truncating Mutation Confers Moderate Risk for Breast Cancer.",
        "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Known gene mutations account for approximately 50% of the hereditary risk for breast cancer. Moderate and low penetrance variants, discovered by genomic approaches, account for an as-yet-unknown proportion of the remaining heritability. A truncating mutation c.325C&gt;T:p.Arg109* (R109X) in the ATP-dependent helicase ERCC3 was observed recurrently among exomes sequenced in BRCA wild-type, breast cancer-affected individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry. Modeling of the mutation in ERCC3-deficient or CRISPR/Cas9-edited cell lines showed a consistent pattern of reduced expression of the protein and concomitant hypomorphic functionality when challenged with UVC exposure or treatment with the DNA alkylating agent IlludinS. Overexpressing the mutant protein in ERCC3-deficient cells only partially rescued their DNA repair-deficient phenotype. Comparison of frequency of this recurrent mutation in over 6,500 chromosomes of breast cancer cases and 6,800 Ashkenazi controls showed significant association with breast cancer risk (OR<sub>BC</sub> = 1.53, OR<sub>ER+</sub> = 1.73), particularly for the estrogen receptor-positive subset (P &lt; 0.007).\nSIGNIFICANCE: A functionally significant recurrent ERCC3 mutation increased the risk for breast cancer in a genetic isolate. Mutated cell lines showed lower survival after in vitro exposure to DNA-damaging agents. Thus, similar to tumors arising in the background of homologous repair defects, mutations in nucleotide excision repair genes such as ERCC3 could constitute potential therapeutic targets in a subset of hereditary breast cancers.

In addition, milk and milk-products contaminated by Staph.\u00a0aureus can cause harmful human diseases. The aim of this study was to characterize Staph.\u00a0aureus strains isolated from dairy farms in Tunisia. Bulk tank milk (n\u00a0=\u00a032) and individual cow milk (n\u00a0=\u00a0130) samples were collected during the period of 2013-2014. Forty-three Staph.\u00a0aureus isolates were recovered and typed by spa typing, 16S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer (RS-PCR) and multiplex PCRs for 22 virulence genes. Antimicrobial resistance was also investigated with a disc diffusion test. A selected subsample of 22 strains was additionally genotyped by multilocus sequence typing. Seventeen spa types were recovered, and t2421 (n\u00a0=\u00a010), t521 (n\u00a0=\u00a06) and t2112 (n\u00a0=\u00a05) were the most common. Fourteen different RS-PCR genotypes grouped into 11 clusters were detected in our study, with predominance of the RVI genotype (n\u00a0=\u00a024). Eight sequence types were identified and Clonal Complex 97, corresponding to RS-PCR cluster R, was the most common (n\u00a0=\u00a010), followed by CC1 (n\u00a0=\u00a04), CC15 (n\u00a0=\u00a03) and other four accounting for one or two strains. Different combinations of virulence genes were reported, and enterotoxin genes were present in few strains (seh, n\u00a0=\u00a04; sea, n\u00a0=\u00a02; sea and seh, n\u00a0=\u00a02; sec and sel, n\u00a0=\u00a02). The majority of strains were resistant only to penicillin; only one strain was found to be multiresistant and no methicillin-resistant Staph.\u00a0aureus was demonstrated. Our study reported the isolation of CC97 from bovine milk in Tunisia for the first time and confirmed the relevance of this lineage in intramammary infection in cows.\nSIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This paper describes the characteristics of\u00a0Staphylococcus aureus isolated from bulk tank and individual cow milk in Tunisia. All strains were genotyped by spa typing and RS-PCR, a method based on the amplification of the 16S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer region, and multiplex PCRs for 22 virulence genes. A selected subsample of strains was also genotyped by multilocus sequence typing. All strains were tested for antimicrobial resistance. Our study evidences a predominance of strains belonging to Clonal Complex 97. Methicillin-resistant strains were not detected, and overall low level of antimicrobial resistance was reported.",

        "abstract": "Mitochondria are double-membrane-bound organelles that are present in all nucleated eukaryotic cells and are responsible for the production of cellular energy in the form of ATP. Mitochondrial function is under dual genetic control - the 16.6-kb mitochondrial genome, with only 37 genes, and the nuclear genome, which encodes the remaining \u223c1300 proteins of the mitoproteome. Mitochondrial dysfunction can arise because of defects in either mitochondrial DNA or nuclear mitochondrial genes, and can present in childhood or adulthood in association with vast clinical heterogeneity, with symptoms affecting a single organ or tissue, or multisystem involvement. There is no cure for mitochondrial disease for the vast majority of mitochondrial disease patients, and a genetic diagnosis is therefore crucial for genetic counselling and recurrence risk calculation, and can impact on the clinical management of affected patients. Next-generation sequencing strategies are proving pivotal in the discovery of new disease genes and the diagnosis of clinically affected patients; mutations in >250 genes have now been shown to cause mitochondrial disease, and the biochemical, histochemical, immunocytochemical and neuropathological characterization of these patients has led to improved diagnostic testing strategies and novel diagnostic techniques. This review focuses on the current genetic landscape associated with mitochondrial disease, before focusing on advances in studying associated mitochondrial pathology in two, clinically relevant organs - skeletal muscle and brain. \u00a9 2016 The Authors.

Because the method relies on summary level results data, LD score regression is computationally tractable even for very large sample sizes. However, publicly available GWAS summary-level data are typically stored in different databases and have different formats, making it difficult to apply LD score regression to estimate genetic correlations across many different traits simultaneously.\nRESULTS: In this manuscript, we describe LD Hub - a centralized database of summary-level GWAS results for 173 diseases/traits from different publicly available resources/consortia and a web interface that automates the LD score regression analysis pipeline. To demonstrate functionality and validate our software, we replicated previously reported LD score regression analyses of 49 traits/diseases using LD Hub; and estimated SNP heritability and the genetic correlation across the different phenotypes. We also present new results obtained by uploading a recent atopic dermatitis GWAS meta-analysis to examine the genetic correlation between the condition and other potentially related traits. In response to the growing availability of publicly accessible GWAS summary-level results data, our database and the accompanying web interface will ensure maximal uptake of the LD score regression methodology, provide a useful database for the public dissemination of GWAS results, and provide a method for easily screening hundreds of traits for overlapping genetic aetiologies.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The web interface and instructions for using LD Hub are available at http://ldsc.broadinstitute.org/ CONTACT: jie.zheng@bristol.ac.ukSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

        "abstract": "The \"bedside-to-bench\" Congenital Central Hypoventilation Syndrome (CCHS) research journey has led to increased phenotypic-genotypic knowledge regarding autonomic nervous system (ANS) regulation, and improved clinical outcomes. CCHS is a neurocristopathy characterized by hypoventilation and ANS dysregulation. Initially described in 1970, timely diagnosis and treatment remained problematic until the first large cohort report (1992), delineating clinical presentation and treatment options. A central role of ANS dysregulation (2001) emerged, precipitating evaluation of genes critical to ANS development, and subsequent 2003 identification of Paired-Like Homeobox 2B (PHOX2B) as the disease-defining gene for CCHS. This breakthrough engendered clinical genetic testing, making diagnosis exact and early tracheostomy/artificial ventilation feasible. PHOX2B genotype-CCHS phenotype relationships were elucidated, informing early recognition and timely treatment for phenotypic manifestations including Hirschsprung disease, prolonged sinus pauses, and neural crest tumors. Simultaneously, cellular models of CCHS-causing PHOX2B mutations were developed to delineate molecular mechanisms. In addition to new insights regarding genetics and neurobiology of autonomic control overall, new knowledge gained has enabled physicians to anticipate and delineate the full clinical CCHS phenotype and initiate timely effective management. In summary, from an initial guarantee of early mortality or severe neurologic morbidity in survivors, CCHS children can now be diagnosed early and managed effectively, achieving dramatically improved quality of life as adults.",

Despite the significant reduction of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality with statins, substantial residual risk of major cardiovascular events remains. This could be because of the difficulty of demonstrating benefits of new drugs in addition to the current standard of care in unselected populations as well as the interindividual variability in drug response. Pharmacogenomics is a promising avenue for the development of novel or failed drugs and for the repurposing of other medications.\nRECENT FINDINGS: Several variants were identified in genes that were associated with the effects of statins on plasma lipids. Genomic studies of mutations in genes that encode drug targets have the potential to inform on the link between drug therapy acting on those targets and clinical outcomes. Recently, ADCY9 gene variants were shown to be significantly associated with responses to dalcetrapib in terms of clinical outcomes, atherosclerosis imaging, cholesterol efflux, and inflammation, which provided support for the conduct of a new prospective clinical trial in a genetically determined population.\nSUMMARY: Pharmacogenomics hold great potential in future lipid trials to decrease failure rates in drug development and to identify patients who will respond with greater benefits and smaller risk.",

It is imperative that modern biobanks align with molecular diagnostic pathology practices not only to provide the type of samples needed for discovery projects but also to ensure requirements for ongoing sample collections and the future needs of researchers are adequately addressed. Biobanks within comprehensive molecular pathology programmes are perfectly positioned to offer more than just tumour derived biospecimens; for example, they have the ability to facilitate researchers gaining access to sample metadata such as digitised scans of tissue samples annotated prior to macrodissection for molecular diagnostics or pseudoanonymised clinical outcome data or research results retrieved from other users utilising the same or overlapping cohorts of samples. Furthermore, biobanks can work with molecular diagnostic laboratories to develop standardised methodologies for the acquisition and storage of samples required for new approaches to research such as 'liquid biopsies' which will ultimately feed into the test validations required in large prospective clinical studies in order to implement liquid biopsy approaches for routine clinical practice. We draw on our experience in Northern Ireland to discuss how this harmonised approach of biobanks working synergistically with molecular pathology programmes is a key for the future success of precision medicine.",

The most effective regimen in lung cancers is different between squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and adenocarcinoma (AD). Therefore a precise diagnosis is crucial, but this has been difficult, particularly for poorly differentiated SCC (PDSCC) and AD without a lepidic growth component (non-lepidic AD). Biomarkers enabling a precise diagnosis are therefore urgently needed.\nMETHODS: Cap Analysis of Gene Expression (CAGE) is a method used to quantify promoter activities across the whole genome by determining the 5' ends of capped RNA molecules with next-generation sequencing. We performed CAGE on 97 frozen tissues from surgically resected lung cancers (22 SCC and 75\u00a0AD), and confirmed the findings by immunohistochemical analysis (IHC) in an independent group (29 SCC and 45\u00a0AD).\nRESULTS: Using the genome-wide promoter activity profiles, we confirmed that the expression of known molecular markers used in IHC for SCC (CK5, CK6, p40 and desmoglein-3) and AD (TTF-1 and napsin A) were different between SCC and AD. We identified two novel marker candidates, SPATS2 for SCC and ST6GALNAC1 for AD, as showing comparable performance and complementary utility to the known markers in discriminating PDSCC and non-lepidic AD. We subsequently confirmed their utility at the protein level by IHC in an independent group.\nCONCLUSIONS: We identified two genes, SPATS2 and ST6GALNAC1, as novel complemental biomarkers discriminating SCC and AD.

In an effort to improve the success rate of IVF, screening embryos for aneuploidy - or pre-implantation genetic screening (PGS) - has been proposed as a means of ensuring only euploid embryos are selected for transfer. Early PGS approaches were based on fluorescence in situ hybridization testing, and have been shown not to improve live birth rates. Recent developments in genetic testing technologies - such as next-generation sequencing and quantitative polymerase chain reaction, coupled with embryo biopsy at the blastocyst stage - have shown promise in improving IVF outcomes, but they remain to be validated in adequately powered, prospective randomized trials. The extent to which IVF with PGS lowers the a priori risk of aneuploidy in ongoing pregnancies so conceived has been poorly described, rendering it difficult to incorporate the potential benefit of PGS into existing prenatal aneuploidy screening regimens such as cell-free DNA testing or conventional combined nuchal translucency and maternal biochemistry assessment. Further data on the sensitivity and specificity of various forms of molecular PGS testing would improve our understanding of the effectiveness and accuracy of these technologies.

In fact, a sedentary lifestyle has been linked to a worsening of cellular ageing biomarkers such as telomere length (TL) and/or specific epigenetic changes (e.g. DNA methylation), with increase of the propensity to aging-related diseases and premature death. Extending our previous findings, we aimed to test the hypothesis that 12 weeks of low frequency, moderate intensity, explosive-type resistance training (EMRT) may attenuate age-associated genomic changes. To this aim, TL, global DNA methylation, TRF2, Ku80, SIRT1, SIRT2 and global protein acetylation, as well as other proteins involved in apoptotic pathway (Bcl-2, Bax and Caspase-3), antioxidant response (TrxR1 and MnSOD) and oxidative damage (myeloperoxidase) were evaluated before and after EMRT in whole blood or peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of elderly subjects. Our findings confirm the potential of EMRT to induce an adaptive change in the antioxidant protein systems at systemic level and suggest a putative role of resistance training in the reduction of global DNA methylation. Moreover, we observed that EMRT counteracts the telomeres' shortening in a manner that proved to be directly correlated with the amelioration of redox homeostasis and efficacy of training regime, evaluated as improvement of both muscle's power/strength and functional parameters.",

The identification of K-Ras as a clinical biomarker and potential therapeutic target has attracted the scientific community to develop effective and precise anticancer drug.

A number of environmental toxins cause parkinsonism in human and animal models. Genetic studies of rare early onset familial PD cases resulted in identification of disease-linked mutations in multiple genes. Nevertheless, the potential interaction between environment and genetics in PD pathogenesis remains largely unknown. We hypothesized that environmental factors induce abnormal epigenetic regulation that is involved in the pathogenesis of both familial and sporadic PD. We determined the global methylation status of 80,000-110,000 CpG sites in each of the five sporadic PD patient brains and five age and postmodern interval matched control brains utilizing bisulfite padlock sequencing. Multiple genes involved in neurogenesis, particularly the ones in the Wnt signaling pathway, were hypermethylated in PD brains compared to their matched control brains. Consistent with the DNA methylation changes, marked reduction of protein expression was observed for four Wnt and neurogenesis related genes (FOXC1, NEURG2, SPRY1, and CTNNB1) in midbrain dopaminergic (DA) neurons of PD. The treatment of low concentration of 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) for cells resulted in downregulation of Wnt related genes.

        "abstract": "There is a great interest in developing biomarkers to enable precision medicine and improve health outcomes of patients with COPD. However, biomarker development is extremely challenging and expensive, and translation of research endeavors to date has been largely unsuccessful. In most cases, biomarkers fail because of poor replication of initial promising results in independent cohorts and/or inability to transfer the biomarker from a discovery platform to a clinical assay. Ultimately, new biomarker assays must address 5 questions for optimal clinical translation. They include the following: is the biomarker likely to be (1) superior (will the test outperform current standards?); (2) actionable (will the test change patient management?); (3) valuable (will the test improve patient outcomes?); (4) economical (will the implementation of the biomarker in the target population be cost-saving or cost-effective?); and (5) clinically deployable (is there a pathway for the biomarker and analytical technology to be implemented in a clinical laboratory?)? In this article we review some of the major barriers to biomarker development in COPD and provide possible solutions to overcome these limitations, enabling translation of promising biomarkers from discovery experiments to clinical implementation.",

        "abstract": "Genomics is revolutionizing our understanding of the molecular basis of renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The advent of unbiased genome-wide association studies has led to the discovery of previously unrecognized genetic predisposing factors that impact an individual's risk of developing RCC. Moreover, large-scale investigations of somatic alterations of the genomic and transcriptomic landscapes in tumours using next-generation sequencing technology have revealed new information on the molecular pathways that are characteristically disrupted in various RCC subtypes. Sequencing studies have revealed that epigenetic machinery and chromatin remodelling complexes are disrupted in >80% of clear cell RCC tumours, the most common form of the disease. The growing knowledge of subtype-specific molecular abnormalities arising from genomics has opened new avenues towards the development of molecular diagnostics for RCC subtypes, and for the rational design of therapeutic approaches tailored to patients based on the molecular profiles of their tumours. Genomic studies have also pinpointed a possible role of environmental exposure to aristolochic acid, a nephrotoxin, in the genesis of the disease in some regions of central Europe. In this Review, we discuss the impact of genomics in identifying the genes and environmental exposures involved in disease susceptibility, and in discovering the molecular pathways that are disrupted somatically in different RCC subtypes. Further, we explore the possibilities provided by this genomic knowledge in providing a precision medicine approach for diagnosing and treating RCC.",

Overlapping phenotypes between the syndromes have been recognized and this make targeted molecular testing for single genes less favorable, instead there is a gaining interest for multi-gene panel-based approaches detecting both SNVs, indels and CNVs in the same assay. We applied a panel including 19 CRC susceptibility genes to 91 individuals of six phenotypic subgroups. Targeted NGS-based sequencing of the whole gene regions including introns of the 19 genes was used. The individuals had a family history of CRC or had a phenotype consistent with a known CRC syndrome. The purpose of the study was to demonstrate the diagnostic difficulties linked to genotype-phenotype diversity and the benefits of using a gene panel. Pathogenicity classification was carried out on 46 detected variants. In total we detected sixteen pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants and 30 variants of unknown clinical significance. Four of the pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were found in BMPR1A in patients with unexplained familial adenomatous polyposis or atypical adenomatous polyposis, which extends the genotype-phenotype spectrum for this gene. Nine patients had more than one variant remaining after the filtration, including three with truncating mutations in BMPR1A, PMS2 and AXIN2. CNVs were found in three patients, in upstream regions of SMAD4, MSH3 and CTNNB1, and one additional individual harbored a 24.2\u00a0kb duplication in CDH1 intron1.",

Patients were randomized for intensive chemotherapy with or without open-label ATRA (45\u00a0mg/m2, days 6-8; 15\u00a0mg/m2, days 9-21). Two cycles of induction therapy were followed by risk-adapted consolidation with high-dose cytarabine or allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. Due to the open label character of the study, analysis was performed on an intention-to-treat (ITT) and a per-protocol (PP) basis. One thousand one hundred patients were randomized (556, STANDARD; 544, ATRA) with 38 patients treated vice versa. Median follow-up for survival was 5.2\u00a0years.

        "abstract": "Serine protease inhibitors (SPIs) play a crucial role in regulation of both host and bacterial serine protease. They are classified into several protein families, where Kazal-type inhibitors are one of families with multi-domain. In the present study, the polymorphism of AiSPI from Bay scallop Argopecten irradians was found to be associated with disease resistance of bay scallop against Listonella anguillarum. Nine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified in the exon region of AiSPI, where five SNPs were non-synonymous mutation. Three of these mutations were located in \"kazal-like 3\"domain, two SNP loci positioned at\u00a0+536,\u00a0+1312 were selected for further association studies. For the locus\u00a0+536, the genotype frequency of A/G in the resistant stock (12.8%) was significantly lower (p\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.05) than that in the susceptible stock (35.1%), while, the genotype A/A in the resistant stock (87.2%) was significantly higher in comparison with susceptible stock (64.9%) (p\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.05). The G allele frequencies were 6.4% and 17.6% in resistant stock and susceptible stock, respectively, and \u03c72-test revealed a significant difference in the frequency distribution between the two stocks (p\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.05). But there was no significant association between the mutation C-T at locus\u00a0+1312 with either resistant or susceptible group (p\u00a0&gt;\u00a00.05). The genotype frequencies of T/T, T/C, C/C at locus\u00a0+1312 were 94.6%, 2.7% and 2.7% respectively in the susceptible stock, while 100%, 0% and 0% respectively in the resistant stock. The amino acid change for the mutation at locus\u00a0+536 A-G was from asparagine to serine, and the predicted homology model of this amino acid variation could affect its function as well as the structural integrity of the domain. In\u00a0vitro elastase inhibition assay of the protein variants at locus\u00a0+536 was conducted to explicate the effect of SNP. The increasing concentration of protein (0\u00a0mmol/L- 2.93\u00a0mmol/L) was incubated with 80\u00a0nmol/L elastase where the residual enzyme activity values for rAiSPI (N) with A variant and rAiSPI (S) with G variant were started to reduce from 0.40 to 0.215 and 0.435 to 0.356, respectively. The elastase inhibition ability of rAiSPI (N) variant was significantly higher than that of rAiSPI (S) (p\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.01). The results suggested that the mutation at locus\u00a0+536A/A significantly associated with disease resistance of bay scallop would shed light for selective breeding program.",

        "abstract": "It is increasingly recognized that cancer is a highly heterogeneous group of illnesses even within a particular organ site (e.g., breast, lung, colon, etc.). This observation presents a serious challenge to the traditional concept of phase 3 randomized trials designed to define therapeutic efficacy of a novel treatment strategy. For while 10% of the patients with a common malignancy (e.g., non-small-cell lung cancer) may be sufficient to consider such an effort, enrolling a sufficient number of patients into a clinical trial in a timely manner to define clinical utility would be extremely difficult if the population in question represented only 1% of this population, and essentially impossible if one wished to explore the benefits of treatment in a rarer neoplasm (e.g. ovarian cancer). Therefore, in the new era of precision cancer medicine, alternative research designs are imperative. One option would be to compare the time-to-disease progression of an individual cancer patient following treatment with a novel therapeutic to the time-to-disease progression for that specific patient on her/his immediately preceding treatment. The rationale for this strategy and early experience with this innovative approach to evaluating the efficacy of anticancer therapy is highlighted in this report.",

Pharmacogenomics is a laboratory method that aids individualized medication selection by predicting drug efficacy and adverse effect profiles. It is a technique that involves the testing of patients' genetic makeup to improve medicinal response and tolerance. Pharmacogenomics aims to clarify pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in addition to focusing on hepatic cytochrome enzyme metabolism. Ultimately, it facilitates optimal selection and adjustment of medications to enhance clinical outcomes. Pharmacogenomics is most useful in cases in which routinely prescribed pharmacotherapies are either suboptimally effective or have unacceptable adverse effects. Once there has been a failure of a therapeutic drug treatment, rather than \"blindly\" selecting an alternative medicine, pharmacogenomic test results can provide guidance for the selection of the most appropriate drug and its dose.

However, most murine models based on single gene mutations fail to recapitulate the CMML phenotype, and many gene mutations are loss of function, making the identification of traditional therapeutic vulnerabilities challenging. Further, as a subtype of the myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms, CMML has a complex clinical heterogeneity not reflected by the mutational landscape. In this review, we will discuss the discordance between mutational homogeneity and clinical complexity and highlight novel genomic and nongenomic approaches that offer insight into the underlying clinical characteristics of CMML.",

Commercially available cancer gene panels rely on manually gathered cancer-related genes, in a \"one-size-fits-many\" solution. The design of new panels requires laborious search of literature and cancer genomics resources, with their performance on cohorts of patients difficult to estimate.\nRESULTS: We present OncoPaD, to our knowledge the first tool aimed at the rational design of cancer gene panels. OncoPaD estimates the cost-effectiveness of the designed panel on a cohort of tumors and provides reports on the importance of individual mutations for tumorigenesis or therapy. With a friendly interface and intuitive input, OncoPaD suggests researchers relevant sets of genes to be included in the panel, because prior knowledge or analyses indicate that their mutations either drive tumorigenesis or function as biomarkers of drug response. OncoPaD also provides reports on the importance of individual mutations for tumorigenesis or therapy that support the interpretation of the results obtained with the designed panel. We demonstrate in silico that OncoPaD designed panels are more cost-effective-i.e. detect a maximum fraction of tumors in the cohort by sequencing a minimum quantity of DNA-than available panels.\nCONCLUSIONS: With its unique features, OncoPaD will help clinicians and researchers design tailored next-generating sequencing (NGS) panels to detect circulating tumor DNA or biopsy specimens, thereby facilitating early and accurate detection of tumors, genomics informed therapeutic decisions, patient follow-up and timely identification of resistance mechanisms to targeted agents.

Sanger sequencing was followed by RT-PCR of the target fragment of cDNA. In silico modeling was performed with CCBulder and Modeller software.\nRESULTS: The diagnosis of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 1B (LGMD1B) was established.

The misdiagnosis rates were 0.12% (Wilson 95% CI 0.05 to 0.25%) in day-3 FISH cycles, 0.48% (Wilson 95% CI 0.19 to 1.22%) in day-3 aCGH cycles and 0.0% (Wilson 95% CI 0 to 0.26) in day-5 aCGH cycles. Although rare, the likely causative biological event for true misdiagnosis is embryonic XX/XY mosaicism. Reanalysis of 1219 abnormal cleavage-stage research embryos revealed a 73% incidence of minor and major mosaicism. Only four (0.3%) embryos were found to be diploid and contained XX and XY cells that could potentially account for the misdiagnosis of sex. Our investigation identified errors leading to misdiagnosis and their attribution to specific events during PGD-A testing. The reported misdiagnosis rates suggest that PGD-A for sex determination is highly accurate, particularly when using aCGH applied to blastocyst biopsies.",

For hereditary-cancer testing, the technical sensitivity and specificity of the assay are paramount as clinicians use results to make important clinical management and treatment decisions. There is significant debate within the diagnostics community regarding the necessity of confirming NGS variant calls by Sanger sequencing, considering that numerous laboratories report having 100% specificity from the NGS data alone. Here we report our results from 20,000 hereditary-cancer NGS panels spanning 47 genes, in which all 7845 nonpolymorphic variants were Sanger- sequenced. Of these, 98.7% were concordant between NGS and Sanger sequencing and 1.3% were identified as NGS false-positives, located mainly in complex genomic regions (A/T-rich regions, G/C-rich regions, homopolymer stretches, and pseudogene regions). Simulating a false-positive rate of zero by adjusting the variant-calling quality-score thresholds decreased the sensitivity of the assay from 100% to 97.8%, resulting in the missed detection of 176 Sanger-confirmed variants, the majority in complex genomic regions (n = 114) and mosaic mutations (n = 7). The data illustrate the importance of setting quality thresholds for panel testing only after thousands of samples have been processed and the necessity of Sanger confirmation of NGS variants to maintain the highest possible sensitivity.",

Similarly, individual variability in learning outcomes has puzzled researchers who seek to create optimal learning environments for students. \"Personalized Learning\" seeks to identify genetic, neural and behavioral predictors of individual differences in learning and aims to use predictors to help create optimal teaching paradigms. Evidence for Personalized Learning can be observed by connecting research in pharmacogenomics, cognitive genetics and behavioral experiments across domains of learning, which provides a framework for conducting empirical studies from the laboratory to the classroom and holds promise for addressing learning effectiveness in the individual learners.

        "abstract": "Spermatogenesis is threatened by DNA alkylating agents, one major category of DNA damaging agents. Currently, little is known about the alterations in transcriptome profiling of the mouse spermatogenic cells in response to DNA alkylation at distinct stages of spermatogenesis. In this study, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed in pachytene spermatocytes (PS) and round spermatids (RS) at 0 or 30min following Methyl Methanesulfonate (MMS) treatment and with untreated controls. A large number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified by comparison of the three groups in PS and RS, respectively. Functional analyses of all DEGs highlighted the protein ubiquitination pathway and DNA damage response (DDR) network being the two main biological processes in common in the two cell types. Further analyses of the DEGs with 2-fold or more changes between 30min repair and control group indicated that several cytokine signaling pathways were the most strongly affected in PS and DDR related pathways in RS, respectively. Gene ontology (GO) analyses directly showed differential biological process (BP) affected between PS and RS, with \"regulation of transcription\" being most overrepresented in PS and \"cellular response to stress\" in RS, respectively. Moreover, 374 DDR-related genes in PS and 158 in RS among all DEGs were filtered and clustered, which showed dynamic expression patterns in PS and RS. Our analyses provide a transcriptional landscape for male germ cells in response to MMS during spermatogenesis.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS) is an autosomal dominant genetic disease. It severely decreases patient quality of life and leads elevated cancer risk. Germline mutation of LKB1 is the leading cause of familial PJS. MATERIAL AND METHODS To characterize the germline mutation of LKB1 gene in Chinese familial and sporadic PJS patients, 14 PJS families, 5 sporadic PJS patients, and 250 healthy adults were collected and genomic DNAs of peripheral blood were extracted. Mutation screenings of LKB1 were performed using MLPA (multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification), PCR, direct sequencing, and PCR-DHPLC (denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography). RESULTS A total of 12 kinds of germline mutations were found in 9 familial PJS patients, most of which were point mutations (7/12); 4 large deletions of LKB1 were also observed. Of the 12 mutations, 7 were pathogenic (2 were de novo), 4 were just polymorphisms, and 1 was indefinitely pathogenic. No pathogenic mutation in exons of the LKB1 gene was detected in the 5 sporadic PJS patients. The mutation detection rate for the LKB1 gene was 85.7% in our Chinese familial PJS and 63.2% in all Chinese PJS patients. Eight familial PJS patients were identified with pathogenic germline mutations in 14 unrelated families (57.1%). Further methylation detection and analysis showed promoter methylation in carcinomatous polyps. CONCLUSIONS LKB1 gene germline mutation with pathogenic effect is a common cause of familial PJS in Chinese patients; however, it is not the only molecular pathogen of PJS. Methylation in the LKB1 gene promoter region may cause carcinomatous change in intestinal polyps.",

Advances in medicine have enhanced survival for preterm infants but the overall incidence of major morbidities has changed very little. Abnormal renal development is an important consequence of premature birth. Acute kidney injury (AKI) in the neonatal period is multifactorial and may increase lifetime risk of chronic kidney disease.Traditional biomarkers in newborns suffer from considerable confounders, limiting their use for early identification of AKI. There is a need to develop novel biomarkers that can identify, in real time, the evolution of renal dysfunction in an early diagnostic, monitoring and prognostic fashion. Use of \"omics\", particularly metabolomics, may provide valuable information regarding functional pathways underlying AKI and prediction of clinical outcomes.The emerging knowledge generated by the application of \"omics\" (genomics, proteomics, metabolomics) in neonatology provides new insights that can help to identify markers of early diagnosis, disease progression, and identify new therapeutic targets. Additionally, omics will have major implications in the field of personalized healthcare in the future.

        "abstract": "Environmental triggers and genetic factors are supposed to lead to complex gene expression changes in psoriasis and interact in the manifestation of the disease. The histamine H4 receptor (HRH4) is functionally expressed on Th17 cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) which play a prominent role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. On pDCs a higher basal expression level of the HRH4 in psoriasis patients compared to healthy controls has been detected. The functional relationship between predisposing genetic variations in the HRH4 gene and psoriasis is yet not known. The aim of the study was to evaluate a possible association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the HRH4 gene primarily in the promotor region and incidence, severity as well as special clinical features (nail involvement, arthritis, palmoplantar location) of psoriasis. For this approach genomic DNA from 206 patients with psoriasis and 213 healthy controls of Caucasian origin was extracted and three SNPs in the promotor region and one SNP located in an intron of the HRH4 gene were analysed by PCR and pyrophosphate DNA-sequencing. The genotype distributions and allele frequencies between the different groups were compared by chi-square test. The analysis of association between HRH4 polymorphisms and psoriasis was assessed by odds ratio with 95% confidence interval. The genotype distributions and allele frequencies of the four SNPs in the HRH4 gene did not show obvious differences between the whole group of psoriasis patients and healthy controls. However, there were differences by trend in subgroup analysis: The mutant genotypes (A/G) of rs17203314 and (G/A) of rs615283 were more frequent in patients with severe psoriasis PASI\u226530 (34.8% and 34.8%) when compared to the control groups (23.5% and 27.2%), respectively. The mutant G/A genotype of rs615283 was significantly more frequent in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis PASI\u226510 when compared to mild psoriasis PASI<10 (33.3% vs 21.7%, p=0.022). For rs524149 and rs17797945 the wildtype CC genotype was more frequent by trend in moderately-to-severely affected patients with PASI\u226510 (85.2% and 63.0%) when compared to the group with mild psoriasis PASI<10 (77.0% and 49.4%), respectively. Furthermore, a significant association of rs615283 with psoriasis palmoplantaris was detected. In conclusion our study suggests that genetic variations within the HRH4 gene might be associated with special clinical features of psoriasis. Further studies are needed in larger study populations to confirm the reported associations and investigate the functional relevance of the identified SNPs.",

With improvements in diagnostic modalities such as functional imaging, oligometastatic prostate cancer is being diagnosed with greater frequency than ever before. Furthermore, the paradigm for treatment of advanced prostate cancers is shifting toward a more aggressive approach. Many questions surround the understanding of the process and consequences of oligometastasis, meaning that the contemporary literature offers a wide variety of definitions of oligometastatic prostate cancer. Until genomic data exist to provide a biological component to the definition of oligometastatic disease, a clinical diagnosis made on the basis of up to five extrapelvic lesions is reasonable for use. Retrospective studies suggest that interventions such as radical prostatectomy and local or metastasis-directed radiotherapy can be performed in the metastatic setting with minimal risk of toxic effects. These therapies seem to decrease the need for subsequent palliative interventions, but insufficient data are available to draw reliable conclusions regarding their effect on survival. Thus, a protocol for clinicians to manage the patient presenting with oligometastatic prostate cancer would be a useful clinical tool.",

Recently, we presented a nanopore-based sequencing-by-synthesis (Nanopore-SBS) approach, which used a set of nucleotides with polymer tags that allow discrimination of the nucleotides in a biological nanopore. Here, we designed and covalently coupled a DNA polymerase to an \u03b1-hemolysin (\u03b1HL) heptamer using the SpyCatcher/SpyTag conjugation approach. These porin-polymerase conjugates were inserted into lipid bilayers on a complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS)-based electrode array for high-throughput electrical recording of DNA synthesis. The designed nanopore construct successfully detected the capture of tagged nucleotides complementary to a DNA base on a provided template. We measured over 200 tagged-nucleotide signals for each of the four bases and developed a classification method to uniquely distinguish them from each other and background signals. The probability of falsely identifying a background event as a true capture event was less than 1.2%. In the presence of all four tagged nucleotides, we observed sequential additions in real time during polymerase-catalyzed DNA synthesis. Single-polymerase coupling to a nanopore, in combination with the Nanopore-SBS approach, can provide the foundation for a low-cost, single-molecule, electronic DNA-sequencing platform.",

        "title": "Exploring Boundaries for the Genetic Consequences of Assortative Mating for Psychiatric Traits.",
        "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Considerable partner resemblances have been found for a wide range of psychiatric disorders, meaning that partners of affected individuals have an increased risk of being affected compared with partners of unaffected individuals. If this resemblance is reflected in genetic similarity between partners, genetic risk is anticipated to accumulate in offspring, but these potential consequences have not been quantified and have been left implicit.\nOBSERVATIONS: The anticipated consequences of partner resemblance on prevalence and heritability of psychiatric traits in the offspring generation were modeled for disorders with varying heritabilities, population prevalence (lifetime risk), and magnitudes of partner resemblance. These models facilitate interpretation for a wide range of psychiatric disorders, such as autism, schizophrenia, and depression. The genetic consequences of partner resemblance are most pronounced when attributable to phenotypic assortment (driven by the psychiatric trait). Phenotypic assortment results in increased genetic variance in the offspring generation, which may result in increased heritability and population prevalence. These consequences add generation after generation to a limit, but assortative mating is unlikely to balance the impact of reduced fecundity of patients with psychiatric disorders in the long term. This modeling suggests that the heritabilities of psychiatric disorders are unlikely to increase by more than 5% from 1 generation of assortative mating (maximally 13% across multiple generations). The population prevalence will increase most for less common disorders with high heritability; for example, the prevalence of autism might increase by 1.5-fold after 1 generation of assortative mating (\u22652.4-fold in the long term) depending on several assumptions.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The considerable partner resemblances found for psychiatric disorders deserve more detailed interpretation than has been provided thus far. Although the limitations of modeling are emphasized, the anticipated consequences are at most modest for the heritability but may be considerable for the population prevalence of rare disorders with a high heritability.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In sub-Saharan Africa, one-third of all births are small for gestational age (SGA), and 4.4 million children are stunted; both conditions increase the risk of child mortality. SGA has also been shown to increase the risk of stunting.\nOBJECTIVE: We tested whether the association between SGA and postneonatal mortality is mediated by stunting.\nMETHODS: We used longitudinal data from children aged 6 wk to 24 mo (n = 12,155) enrolled in the ZVITAMBO (Zimbabwe Vitamin A for Mothers and Babies) trial. HIV exposure was defined based on maternal HIV status at baseline. SGA was defined as birthweight <10th percentile of the INTERGROWTH-21st (International Fetal and Newborn Growth Consortium for the 21st Century) standards. We used a standard mediation approach by comparing the attenuation of the risk when the mediator was added to the model. We used Cox proportional hazards models first to regress SGA on postneonatal mortality, controlling for age. Stunting (length-for-age z score <-2) was then included in the model to test mediation.\nRESULTS: Approximately 20% of children were term SGA, and 23% were stunted before their last follow-up visit. In this cohort, 31% of children were exposed to HIV; the HIV-exposed group represented a pooled group of HIV-infected and HIV-exposed but uninfected children. Postneonatal mortality was significantly higher among children born SGA (HR: 1.5; 95% CI: 1.3, 1.7). This association was attenuated and not statistically significant when stunting was included in the model, suggesting a mediation effect (HR: 1.1; 95% CI: 0.91, 1.3). When stratified by HIV exposure status, we observed a significant attenuation of the risk, suggesting mediation, only among HIV-exposed children (model 1, HR: 1.3; 95% CI: 1.1, 1.6; model 2, HR: 1.1; 95% CI: 0.88, 1.3).\nCONCLUSIONS: This analysis aids in investigating pathways that underlie an observed SGA-mortality relation and may inform survival interventions in undernourished settings.",

Maternal venous blood samples were obtained within 24h before delivery. In addition to serum inhibin and leptin, birth order, multiple pregnancy, maternal age, maternal overweight/obesity, maternal education, maternal smoking and family history of diabetes/hypertension, were examined as risk factors. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed.\nRESULTS: At the univariate analysis, serum inhibin and leptin levels were significantly higher in cases vs.\nCONTROLS: Pre-eclampsia occurred more frequently in primiparous women, whereas overweight and obesity were also associated with pre-eclampsia.

The ability of the gut microbiota to metabolize quercetin has been previously documented; however, the effect that quercetin may have on commensal gut microbes remains unclear. In the present study, the effects of quercetin on the commensal gut microbes Ruminococcus gauvreauii, Bifidobacterium catenulatum and Enterococcus caccae were determined through evaluation of growth patterns and cell morphology, and analysis of genetic expression profiles between quercetin treated and non-treated groups using Single Molecule RNA sequencing via Helicos technology. Results of this study revealed that phenotypically, quercetin did not prevent growth of Ruminococcus gauvreauii, mildly suppressed growth of Bifidobacterium catenulatum, and moderately inhibited growth of Enterococcus caccae. Genetic analysis revealed that in response to quercetin, Ruminococcus gauvreauii down regulated genes responsible for protein folding, purine synthesis and metabolism. Bifidobacterium catenulatum increased expression of the ABC transport pathway and decreased metabolic pathways and cell wall synthesis. Enterococcus caccae upregulated genes responsible for energy production and metabolism, and downregulated pathways of stress response, translation and sugar transport. For the first time, the effect of quercetin on the growth and genetic expression of three different commensal gut bacteria was documented. The data provides insight into the interactions between genetic regulation and growth.

        "abstract": "Autosomal dominant osteopetrosis type II (ADO2) is a heritable osteosclerotic bone disorder due to dysfunctional osteoclast activity. ADO2 is caused by missense mutations in the chloride channel 7 (CLCN7) gene characterized by osteosclerosis with multiple fractures. ADO2 can result in osteomyelitis, visual loss and bone marrow failure. Currently, there is no cure for ADO2, and until recently no appropriate animal model of ADO2 existed to understand better the pathogenesis of this disease and to test new therapies. Therefore, we created ADO2 knock-in mouse model with a G213R (human homolog of G215R) missense mutation in the Clcn7 gene on 129S1 background, and demonstrated that this mouse model phenocopies human ADO2. As ADO2 gives rise to incomplete penetrance (66%) in human and marked phenotypic variability is observed among patients with the same mutation, we hypothesized that the severity and penetrance of ADO2 will also vary in mouse models on different genetic backgrounds. To test this, we created ADO2 mouse models in DBA/D2, C57BL/6J/B6 and Balb/c strains, and compared bone phenotypes and performed serum biochemical analysis between strain- and age-matched wild-type (WT) and ADO2 mice. At 3months of age, whole body aBMD was higher (4-7% in male; 1-5% in female) in the ADO2 mice compared to their wild-type littermates. In addition, ADO2 male mice on 129 background displayed highest percent increase of BV/TV (106%), followed by D2 (92%), B6 (46%), and Balb/c (33%) compared to strain-matched wild-type mice. We observed similar differences for BV/TV between ADO2 and wild-type mice on different genetic backgrounds in female: 129 (96%)>D2 (73%)>Balb/c (39%) and B6 (36%). Serum calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase and P1NP levels were similar in the WT and ADO2 mice on all genetic backgrounds but TRAP was higher (76% to 220% in male; 33-95% in female) and CTX/TRAP ratio was lower (39-65% in male and 3-41% in female) in the ADO2 mice compared to their strain-matched wild-type littermates. We also found that young (3months) ADO2 mice on 129S1 background exhibited 200% higher trabecular BV/TV whereas old (18months) ADO2 mice displayed 400-700% higher BV/TV compared to their age-matched wild-type controls. In summary, phenotypic severity in ADO2 mice varied markedly on different genetic backgrounds (129>D2>Balb/c>B6) and became more pronounced with age, which resembles the wide variations in phenotype observed in ADO2 patients. These mouse models will help us to identify genes/factors that influence severity and penetrance of ADO2, and test innovative therapies to treat this disease.",

Relationships between molecular descriptors and toxicity thresholds previously identified the octanol-water distribution coefficient, log D, and the HOMO-LUMO energy gap, \u0394E, as two useful properties in the identification of reduced aquatic toxicity. To determine whether these two property-based guidelines are applicable to sublethal oxidative stress (OS) responses, two common aquatic in vivo models, the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) and zebrafish (Danio rerio), were employed to examine traditional biochemical biomarkers (lipid peroxidation, DNA damage, and total glutathione) and antioxidant gene activation following exposure to eight structurally diverse industrial chemicals (bisphenol A, cumene hydroperoxide, dinoseb, hydroquinone, indene, perfluorooctanoic acid, R-(-)-carvone, and tert-butyl hydroperoxide). Bisphenol A, cumene hydroperoxide, dinoseb, and hydroquinone were consistent inducers of OS. Glutathione was the most consistently affected biomarker, suggesting its utility as a sensitivity response to support the design of less hazardous chemicals. Antioxidant gene expression (changes in nrf2, gclc, gst, and sod) was most significantly (p < 0.05) altered by R-(-)-carvone, cumene hydroperoxide, and bisphenol A. Results from the present study indicate that metabolism of parent chemicals and the role of their metabolites in molecular initiating events should be considered during the design of less hazardous chemicals.

Therefore, comparing the neurula transcriptomes between flatfish species with different eye-reversal mutants may provide very useful information to screen for genes involved in eye asymmetry. In this study, two cDNA libraries constructed from neurulas of P. stellatus (high ratio of eye reversal) and P. olivaceus (very low ratio of eye reversal) were sequenced and compared. There were 8121 and 8108 unigenes annotated to 32 categories in P. stellatus and P. olivaceus, respectively, and the highest KEGG pathways in both species were 'signal transduction', 'immune system', and 'endocrine system'.

Technological innovations (eg, activity trackers) are making it more common for people to collect PGHD, but little is known about how PGHD might be used in outpatient clinics.\nOBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to examine the experiences of health care professionals who use PGHD in outpatient clinics.\nMETHODS: We conducted an evaluation of Project HealthDesign Round 2 to synthesize findings from 5 studies funded to test tools designed to help patients collect PGHD and share these data with members of their health care team. We conducted semistructured interviews with 13 Project HealthDesign study team members and 12 health care professionals that participated in these studies. We used an immersion-crystallization approach to analyze data. Our findings provide important information related to health care professionals' attitudes toward and experiences with using PGHD in a clinical setting.\nRESULTS: Health care professionals identified 3 main benefits of PGHD accessibility in clinical settings: (1) deeper insight into a patient's condition; (2) more accurate patient information, particularly when of clinical relevance; and (3) insight into a patient's health between clinic visits, enabling revision of care plans for improved health goal achievement, while avoiding unnecessary clinic visits. Study participants also identified 3 areas of consideration when implementing collection and use of PGHD data in clinics: (1) developing practice workflows and protocols related to PGHD collection and use; (2) data storage, accessibility at the point of care, and privacy concerns; and (3) ease of using PGHD data.\nCONCLUSIONS: PGHD provides value to both patients and health care professionals. However, more research is needed to understand the benefit of using PGHD in clinical care and to identify the strategies and clinic workflow needs for optimizing these tools.",

In this Commentary we discuss access to this knowledge, the politics that govern peer review and publication, and the role of this knowledge as a public good in medicine. \u2003Gutenberg's invention of the printing press in 1440 opened an avenue for the distribution of scholarly information to the entire world. The scientific literature first appeared in 1665 with Le Journal des S\u00e7avans followed in the same year by Philosophical Transactions. Today there are more than 5000 scientific publishing companies, 25,000 journals and 1.5 million articles published/year generating revenue of $25 billion USD. \u2003The European Union and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development have argued for open access (OA) to scientific data for all publicly funded research by 2020 with a similar initiative in the USA via the Fair Access to Science and Technology Research Act (FASTR). However, OA to published science is but one step in this odyssey. If the products of science are not openly available then it can be argued that the norms of science as defined by Merton including \"universalism\" and \"communalism\" have yet to be accomplished.

        "abstract": "Chemical toxicity is conventionally evaluated in animal models. However, animal models are resource intensive; moreover, they face ethical and scientific challenges because the outcomes obtained by animal testing may not correlate with human responses. To develop an alternative method for assessing chemical toxicity, we investigated the feasibility of using chemical-induced genome-wide expression changes in cultured human cells to predict the potential of a chemical to cause specific organ injuries in humans. We first created signatures of chemical-induced gene expression in a vertebral-cancer of the prostate cell line for \u223c15,000 chemicals tested in the US National Institutes of Health Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures program. We then used the signatures to create na\u0131\u0308ve Bayesian prediction models for chemical-induced human liver cholestasis, interstitial nephritis, and long QT syndrome. Detailed cross-validation analyses indicated that the models were robust with respect to false positives and false negatives in the samples we used to train the models and could predict the likelihood that chemicals would cause specific organ injuries. In addition, we performed a literature search for drugs and dietary supplements, not formally categorized as causing organ injuries in humans but predicted by our models to be most likely to do so. We found a high percentage of these compounds associated with case reports of relevant organ injuries, lending support to the idea that in vitro cell-based experiments can be used to predict the toxic potential of chemicals. We believe that this approach, combined with a robust technique to model human exposure to chemicals, may serve as a promising alternative to animal-based chemical toxicity assessment.",

We aimed to develop a breast cancer prediction model for postmenopausal women that would take into account their individualized competing risk of non-breast cancer death.\nMETHODS: We included 73,066 women who completed the 2004 Nurses' Health Study (NHS) questionnaire (all\u00a0\u226557\u00a0years) and followed participants until May 2014. We considered 17 breast cancer risk factors (health behaviors, demographics, family history, reproductive factors) and 7 risk factors for non-breast cancer death (comorbidities, functional dependency) and mammography use. We used competing risk regression to identify factors independently associated with breast cancer. We validated the final model by examining calibration (expected-to-observed ratio of breast cancer incidence, E/O) and discrimination (c-statistic) using 74,887 subjects from the Women's Health Initiative Extension Study (WHI-ES; all were\u00a0\u226555\u00a0years and followed for 5\u00a0years).\nRESULTS: Within 5\u00a0years, 1.8\u00a0% of NHS participants were diagnosed with breast cancer (vs. 2.0\u00a0% in WHI-ES, p\u00a0=\u00a00.02), and 6.6\u00a0% experienced non-breast cancer death (vs. 5.2\u00a0% in WHI-ES, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Using a model selection procedure which incorporated the Akaike Information Criterion, c-statistic, statistical significance, and clinical judgement, our final model included 9 breast cancer risk factors, 5 comorbidities, functional dependency, and mammography use. The model's c-statistic was 0.61 (95\u00a0% CI [0.60-0.63]) in NHS and 0.57 (0.55-0.58) in WHI-ES. On average, our model under predicted breast cancer in WHI-ES (E/O 0.92 [0.88-0.97]).\nCONCLUSIONS: We developed a novel prediction model that factors in postmenopausal women's individualized competing risks of non-breast cancer death when estimating breast cancer risk.",

Several genetic alterations potentially driving tumour progression have been described, representing a possible target for new compounds. Areas covered: A clinical trial search in Clinicaltrials.gov encompassing a literature search in PubMed and ASCO/ESMO Websites was undertaken in March 2016.

The main reasons could be the low number of patients enrolled in trials, and the lack of a patient selection based on the biological profile of the tumours. Potential active drugs could have been discharged simply because beneficial in a particular subgroup of patients and not in un unselected population. The future direction of the research should consider biomarker evaluation in order to describe the genetic alteration/s that drive tumour progression and aggressiveness and the mechanisms of drug resistance.

Many methods have been developed to account for the specifics of count data: non-normality, a dependence of the variance on the mean, and small sample size. Among them, the small number of samples in typical experiments is still a challenge. Here we present a method for differential analysis of count data, using conditional estimation of local pooled dispersion parameters. A comprehensive evaluation of our proposed method in the aspect of differential gene expression analysis using both simulated and real data sets shows that the proposed method is more powerful than other existing methods while controlling the false discovery rates. By introducing conditional estimation of local pooled dispersion parameters, we successfully overcome the limitation of small power and enable a powerful quantitative analysis focused on differential expression test with the small number of samples.",

Here we endow E. coli with a system for efficient, programmable replacement of genomic DNA with long (>100-kb) synthetic DNA, through the in vivo excision of double-stranded DNA from an episomal replicon by CRISPR/Cas9, coupled to lambda-red-mediated recombination and simultaneous positive and negative selection. We iterate the approach, providing a basis for stepwise whole-genome replacement. We attempt systematic recoding in an essential operon using eight synonymous recoding schemes. Each scheme systematically replaces target codons with defined synonyms and is compatible with codon reassignment.

These were rapidly adopted into clinical practice in many countries after a series of successful trials of various independent submethods. Here we present results of own NIPT trial carried out in Moscow, Russia. 1012 samples were subjected to the method aimed at measuring chromosome coverage by massive parallel sequencing. Two alternative approaches are ascertained: one based on maternal/fetal differential methylation and another based on allelic difference. While the former failed to provide stable results, the latter was found to be promising and worthy of conducting a large-scale trial. One critical point in any NIPT approach is the determination of fetal cell-free DNA fraction, which dictates the reliability of obtained results for a given sample. We show that two different chromosome Y representation measures-by real-time PCR and by whole-genome massive parallel sequencing-are practically interchangeable (r=0.94). We also propose a novel method based on maternal/fetal allelic difference which is applicable in pregnancies with fetuses of either sex. Even in its pilot form it correlates well with chromosome Y coverage estimates (r=0.74) and can be further improved by increasing the number of polymorphisms.",

Our objectives were to evaluate the frequency of genomic alterations, clinical \"actionability\" of somatic variants, enrollment in mutation-targeted or other clinical trials, and outcome of molecular profiling for advanced solid tumor patients at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre (PM).\nMETHODS: Patients with advanced solid tumors aged \u226518\u00a0years, good performance status, and archival tumor tissue available were prospectively consented. DNA from archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissue was tested using a MALDI-TOF MS hotspot panel or a targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) panel. Somatic variants were classified according to clinical actionability and an annotated report included in the electronic medical record. Oncologists were provided with summary tables of their patients' molecular profiling results and available mutation-specific clinical trials. Enrolment in genotype-matched versus genotype-unmatched clinical trials following release of profiling results and response by RECIST v1.1 criteria were evaluated.\nRESULTS: From March 2012 to July 2014, 1893 patients were enrolled and 1640 tested. After a median follow-up of 18\u00a0months, 245 patients (15\u00a0%) who were tested were subsequently treated on 277 therapeutic clinical trials, including 84 patients (5\u00a0%) on 89 genotype-matched trials. The overall response rate was higher in patients treated on genotype-matched trials (19\u00a0%) compared with genotype-unmatched trials (9\u00a0%; p\u2009<\u20090.026). In a multi-variable model, trial matching by genotype (p\u2009=\u20090.021) and female gender (p\u2009=\u20090.034) were the only factors associated with increased likelihood of treatment response.\nCONCLUSIONS: Few advanced solid tumor patients enrolled in a prospective institutional molecular profiling trial were treated subsequently on genotype-matched therapeutic trials. In this non-randomized comparison, genotype-enrichment of early phase clinical trials was associated with an increased objective tumor response rate.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT01505400 (date of registration 4 January 2012).",

Therefore, scientists are now focusing on the molecular characterization of CTC as a way to explore its possible use as a \"surrogate\" of tumor tissues to non-invasively assess the genomic landscape of the cancer and its evolution during treatment. Additionally, evidences confirm the existence of CTC in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) characterized by a variable loss of epithelial markers. Since the EMT process can originate cells with enhanced invasiveness, stemness and drug-resistance, the enumeration and characterization of this population, perhaps the one truly responsible of tumor recurrence and progression, could be more clinically useful. For these reasons, several devices able to capture CTC independently from the expression of epithelial markers have been developed. In this review, we will describe the types of heterogeneity so far identified and the key role played by the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in driving CTC heterogeneity. The clinical relevance of detecting CTC-heterogeneity will be discussed as well.",

        "abstract": "Human major depressive disorder (MDD), along with related mood disorders, is among the world's greatest public health concerns; however, its pathophysiology remains poorly understood. Persistent changes in gene expression are known to promote physiological aberrations implicated in MDD. More recently, histone mechanisms affecting cell type- and regional-specific chromatin structures have also been shown to contribute to transcriptional programs related to depressive behaviors, as well as responses to antidepressants. Although much emphasis has been placed in recent years on roles for histone posttranslational modifications and chromatin-remodeling events in the etiology of MDD, it has become increasingly clear that replication-independent histone variants (e.g., H3.3), which differ in primary amino acid sequence from their canonical counterparts, similarly play critical roles in the regulation of activity-dependent neuronal transcription, synaptic connectivity, and behavioral plasticity. Here, we demonstrate a role for increased H3.3 dynamics in the nucleus accumbens (NAc)-a key limbic brain reward region-in the regulation of aberrant social stress-mediated gene expression and the precipitation of depressive-like behaviors in mice. We find that molecular blockade of these dynamics promotes resilience to chronic social stress and results in a partial renormalization of stress-associated transcriptional patterns in the NAc. In sum, our findings establish H3.3 dynamics as a critical, and previously undocumented, regulator of mood and suggest that future therapies aimed at modulating striatal histone dynamics may potentiate beneficial behavioral adaptations to negative emotional stimuli.",

The presence of A\u03b2<sub>(1-42)</sub> in the brain is strongly correlated with cognitive impairment, cholinergic deficiency, bioenergetics disruption, cell death and DNA damage. Galanthamine is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (AChEI) used to symptomatic treatment of Alzheime\u0155s disease (AD). Several studies have showed that galanthamine has antioxidant properties, anti-apoptotic action and also promotes neurogenesis; however, it is unknown whether galanthamine may present protection mechanisms against A\u03b2<sub>(1-42)-</sub>induced genomic instability. To understand the mechanisms of this neuroprotection, we studied the effects of galanthamine on the cell toxicity and DNA strand breaks induced by A\u03b2<sub>(1-42)</sub> using a set of biomarkers such as clonogenic assay, cytokinesis block micronucleus cytome (CBNM-cyt) and comet assay. The results showed that galanthamine treatments were capable to significantly reduce the A\u03b2<sub>(1-42)</sub>-induced cytotoxicity and genotoxicity. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that in addition to inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), galanthamine exerts antigenotoxic properties.

By substituting the common subnetwork model with a simpler local subnetwork model, LEAN allows exact, parameter-free, efficient and exhaustive identification of local subnetworks that are statistically dysregulated, and directly implicates single genes for follow-up experiments.\nUNLABELLED: Evaluation on simulated and biological data suggests that LEAN generally detects dysregulated subnetworks better, and reflects biological similarity between experiments more clearly than standard approaches. A strong signal for the local subnetwork around Von Willebrand Factor (VWF), a gene which showed no change on the mRNA level, was identified by LEAN in transcriptome data in the context of the genetic disease Cerebral Cavernous Malformations (CCM). This signal was experimentally found to correspond to an unexpected strong cellular effect on the VWF protein. LEAN can be used to pinpoint statistically significant local subnetworks in any genome-scale dataset.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The R-package LEANR implementing LEAN is supplied as supplementary material and available on CRAN ( https://cran.r-project.org ).\nCONTACTS: benno@pasteur.fr or tournier-lasserve@univ-paris-diderot.fr.\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Natural killer (NK) cell alloreactivity is favored after double umbilical cord blood transplantation (dUCBT) in which cord blood (UCB) units and patients are often HLA class I mismatched. Generally, only 1 UCB unit persists after dUCBT. We hypothesize, that NK cell alloreactivity mediated by killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR)-HLA interactions may explain the dominance of 1UCB unit over the other after dUCBT.\nMETHODS: We investigated the impact of KIR NK cell alloreactivities on the dominance of 1 full UCB unit in 50 dUCBT. We analyzed the effects of the KIR/HLA genetic incompatibilities and studied cord blood cells at both the phenotypic and functional levels.\nRESULTS: The genetic combination of KIR3DL1 loser UCB unit/Bw4 winner UCB unit determined both the dominance of 1 UCB unit (hazards ratio, 2.88 [1.32-6.27], P = 0.0077) and correlated with an increased incidence of relapse (hazards ratio, 4.91 [1.39-17.3], P = 0.0134). It is interesting to note that cord blood cells exhibited extremely low HLA class I expression. Moreover, resting cord blood KIR3DL1 NK cells exhibited a basal alloreactivity against Bw4 target cells that increased upon activation, thus triggering death by apoptosis.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our unicentric study suggests, for the first time, the significant impact of KIR NK cell alloreactivity in the determination of which UCB unit will dominate in dUCBT.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Unambiguous HLA typing is important in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), HLA disease association studies, and solid organ transplantation. However, current molecular typing methods only interrogate the antigen recognition site (ARS) of HLA genes, resulting in many cis-trans ambiguities that require additional typing methods to resolve. Here we report high-resolution HLA typing of 10,063 National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) registry donors using long-range PCR by next generation sequencing (NGS) approach on buccal swab DNA.\nMETHODS: Multiplex long-range PCR primers amplified the full-length of HLA class I genes (A, B, C) from promotor to 3' UTR. Class II genes (DRB1, DQB1) were amplified from exon 2 through part of exon 4. PCR amplicons were pooled and sheared using Covaris fragmentation. Library preparation was performed using the Illumina TruSeq Nano kit on the Beckman FX automated platform. Each sample was tagged with a unique barcode, followed by 2\u00d7250 bp paired-end sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq. HLA typing was assigned using Omixon Twin software that combines two independent computational algorithms to ensure high confidence in allele calling. Consensus sequence and typing results were reported in Histoimmunogenetics Markup Language (HML) format. All homozygous alleles were confirmed by Luminex SSO typing and exon novelties were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\nRESULTS: Using this automated workflow, over 10,063 NMDP registry donors were successfully typed under high-resolution by NGS. Despite known challenges of nucleic acid degradation and low DNA concentration commonly associated with buccal-based specimens, 97.8% of samples were successfully amplified using long-range PCR. Among these, 98.2% were successfully reported by NGS, with an accuracy rate of 99.84% in an independent blind Quality Control audit performed by the NDMP. In this study, NGS-HLA typing identified 23 null alleles (0.023%), 92 rare alleles (0.091%) and 42 exon novelties (0.042%).\nCONCLUSION: Long-range, unambiguous HLA genotyping is achievable on clinical buccal swab-extracted DNA. Importantly, full-length gene sequencing and the ability to curate full sequence data will permit future interrogation of the impact of introns, expanded exons, and other gene regulatory sequences on clinical outcomes in transplantation.",

Trastuzumab as a single agent did not demonstrate activity in such cases but there are no reports on its combined use with taxanes. We report the outcome in patients treated simultaneously with trastuzumab and paclitaxel for advanced or recurrent HER2-positive endometrial carcinoma and compared it to their microsatellite instability (MSI) status and PIK3CA mutational profiles.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with advancedor recurrent endometrial carcinoma showing HER2 overexpression (2+ or 3+ immunohistochemical staining) or HER2 amplification (fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) HER2/chromosome 17 centromere (CEP 17) ratio &gt;2.0) were treated with trastuzumab (8 mg/kg) and paclitaxel (90 mg/m2) every three weeks. Evaluation of the response was assessed according to the response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) guidelines. Endometrial tumors, sampled before the beginning of trastuzumab, were genotyped for PIK3CA hot spot mutations using Sequenom iPLEX Assay technology.\nRESULTS: Two uterine serous adenocarcinomas and one grade 3 endometrioid adenocarcinoma showing HER2 positivity were treated with trastuzumab and paclitaxel. Between three and seven months of treatment, the three cases showed progressive disease. The genomic analysis of the three cases showed different mutational profiles. One case was found to have MSI and had one PIK3CA mutation. The two others showed no hot spot mutation for PIK3CA.\nCONCLUSION: Even associated with paclitaxel, HER2-positive endometrial carcinomas poorly responded to trastuzumab. This report underlines the low accuracy of HER2 positivity to predict response of endometrial cancer to combined targeted therapy using trastuzumab and paclitaxel.",

        "abstract": "Plasma DNA obtained from a pregnant woman was sequenced to a depth of 270\u00d7 haploid genome coverage. Comparing the maternal plasma DNA sequencing data with the parental genomic DNA data and using a series of bioinformatics filters, fetal de novo mutations were detected at a sensitivity of 85% and a positive predictive value of 74%. These results represent a 169-fold improvement in the positive predictive value over previous attempts. Improvements in the interpretation of the sequence information of every base position in the genome allowed us to interrogate the maternal inheritance of the fetus for 618,271 of 656,676 (94.2%) heterozygous SNPs within the maternal genome. The fetal genotype at each of these sites was deduced individually, unlike previously, where the inheritance was determined for a collection of sites within a haplotype. These results represent a 90-fold enhancement in the resolution in determining the fetus's maternal inheritance. Selected genomic locations were more likely to be found at the ends of plasma DNA molecules. We found that a subset of such preferred ends exhibited selectivity for fetal- or maternal-derived DNA in maternal plasma. The ratio of the number of maternal plasma DNA molecules with fetal preferred ends to those with maternal preferred ends showed a correlation with the fetal DNA fraction. Finally, this second generation approach for noninvasive fetal whole-genome analysis was validated in a pregnancy diagnosed with cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome with maternal plasma DNA sequenced to 195\u00d7 coverage. The causative de novo BRAF mutation was successfully detected through the maternal plasma DNA analysis.",

        "abstract": "Gastric cancer remains a major health burden worldwide. There is near-universal agreement that neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is a preferred management for locally advanced gastric cancer (LAGC). However, the optimal approach for an individual patient is still not clear and remains controversial, which could be at least partly explained by the lack of predictive tools. The ability to predict chemosensitivity from NAC in routine clinical practice is difficult and is an area of intense investigation, especially in the Precision-Medicine Era. Available consistent evidence suggests that a favorable tumor histopathological response to NAC may be a useful positive prognostic marker in gastric cancer. Hence, it is reasonable to speculate that making the histopathological response from NAC predictable will dramatically facility the NAC and improve patients' outcome. This review provides an overview on the current status of predictive biomarkers for histopathological response from NAC in LAGC, including clinicopathological variables, imaging and molecular testing. Furthermore, limitations and future perspectives are also discussed.",

        "abstract": "Cancer occurs as a result of alterations in oncogenes, tumor-suppressor genes, and microRNA genes. Over the past few decades, efforts have been made to understand the dominant oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes whose respective activation/upregulation or loss of function serve to impart aberrant properties on normal cells. Cancer continues to be a source of public health concern due to widespread prevalence, morbidity and mortality. The most common types include but are not limited to lung, prostate, colorectal, breast, ovarian and skin cancers. In 2012, there were more than 8 million deaths worldwide related to cancer from 14 million new cases. Cancer chemotherapy frequently requires long periods of multiple intravenous infusions which may compel patients to abandon treatment. One approach to overcome this challenge is through the use of transdermal drug delivery systems. The major obstacle with transdermal drug delivery is that the stratum corneum, which is the outermost layer of the skin, hinders the penetration of therapeutic agents. An avalanche of techniques is available to enhance the penetration of anticancer agents across the skin including iontophoresis, sonophoresis, microneedles, prodrugs, microemulsions and elastic liposomes. In this review, attention is focused on the numerous techniques used to overcome the skin barrier and enhance the percutaneous penetration of anticancer agents.",

Results were compared with ETS-related gene status and deletions of PTEN, 3p13, 5q21 and 6q15. MSH6, MLH1 and PMS2 expression was detectable in 89.5%, 85.4% and 85.0% of cancers and was particularly strong in cancers with advanced pathological tumor stage (P < 0.0001 each), high Gleason grade (P < 0.0001 each), nodal metastasis (P \u2264 0.0083) and early biochemical recurrence (P < 0.0001). High levels of MMR gene expression paralleled features of genetic instability, such as the number of genomic deletions per cancer; strong expression of all three MMR genes was found in 24%, 29%, 30%, 33% and 42% of cancers with no, one, two, three or four to five deletions (P < 0.0001). The prognostic value of the analyzed MMR genes was largely driven by the subset of cancers lacking ERG fusion (P < 0.0001), while the prognostic impact of MMR gene overexpression was only marginal in ERG-positive cancers. Multivariate analyses suggested an independent prognostic relevance of MMR genes in ERG-negative prostate cancers when compared with prognostic parameters available at the time of initial biopsy. In conclusion, MMR overexpression is common in prostate cancer and is linked to poor outcome as well as features indicating genetic instability.

We examined the individual and joint effects of chemotherapy and genetic susceptibility on VTE risk in patients with breast cancer.\nEXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A Swedish population-based study including 4,261 women diagnosed with primary invasive breast cancer between 2001 and 2008 in Stockholm, followed until 2012. Risk stratification by chemotherapy and genetic susceptibility [a polygenic risk score (PRS), including nine established VTE loci] was assessed using Kaplan-Meier and flexible parametric survival analyses, adjusting for patient, tumor, and treatment characteristics.\nRESULTS: In total, 276 patients experienced a VTE event during a median follow-up of 7.6 years. Patients receiving chemotherapy [HR (95% CI) = 1.98; 1.40-2.80] and patients in the highest 5% of the PRS [HR (95% CI) = 1.90; 1.24-2.91] were at increased risk of developing VTE. Chemotherapy and PRS acted independently on VTE risk and the 1-year cumulative incidence in patients carrying both risk factors was 9.5% compared with 1.3% in patients not having these risk factors (P < 0.001). Stratified analyses by age showed that the risk-increasing effect of PRS was stronger in older patients (P interaction = 0.04), resulting in an excess risk among genetically susceptible patients receiving chemotherapy aged \u2265 60 years (1-year cumulative incidence = 25.0%).\nCONCLUSIONS: Risk stratification by chemotherapy and genetic susceptibility identifies patients with breast cancer at high VTE risk, who could potentially benefit from thromboprophylaxis.

        "abstract": "Flagellated bacteria modulate their swimming behavior in response to environmental cues through the CheA/CheY signaling pathway. In addition to responding to external chemicals, bacteria also monitor internal conditions that reflect the availability of oxygen, light, and reducing equivalents, in a process termed \"energy taxis.\" In Escherichia coli, the transmembrane receptor Aer is the primary energy sensor for motility. Genetic and physiological data suggest that Aer monitors the electron transport chain through the redox state of its FAD cofactor. However, direct biochemical data correlating FAD redox chemistry with CheA kinase activity have been lacking. Here, we test this hypothesis via functional reconstitution of Aer into nanodiscs. As purified, Aer contains fully oxidized FAD, which can be chemically reduced to the anionic semiquinone (ASQ). Oxidized Aer activates CheA, whereas ASQ Aer reversibly inhibits CheA. Under these conditions, Aer cannot be further reduced to the hydroquinone, in contrast to the proposed Aer signaling model. Pulse ESR spectroscopy of the ASQ corroborates a potential mechanism for signaling in that the resulting distance between the two flavin-binding PAS (Per-Arnt-Sim) domains implies that they tightly sandwich the signal-transducing HAMP domain in the kinase-off state. Aer appears to follow oligomerization patterns observed for related chemoreceptors, as higher loading of Aer dimers into nanodiscs increases kinase activity. These results provide a new methodological platform to study Aer function along with new mechanistic details into its signal transduction process.",

Because it is scalable and quantitative, the protein-fragment complementation assay (PCA) using dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) as the reporter protein provides an exceptionally powerful tool for such a purpose. Here, we describe a fully automated protocol that combines DHFR PCA for protein-protein interaction measurement and synthetic genetic array (SGA) technology for introducing mutant and other alleles into PCA strains using genetic crosses. In this, PCA strains are crossed with strains carrying a gene deletion and SGA markers, and the recombinant haploid progeny are selected by SGA. The resulting haploid strains, each expressing a DHFR-fragment fusion protein in a gene-specific haploid deletion background, are crossed to measure the interaction between the two recombinant proteins by PCA in a diploid homozygous deletion background.

Therefore, CYP2C gene polymorphism is used as a genome biomarker for predicting responsiveness to administered drugs. The most direct method for understanding the extent of the effects of CYP2C gene polymorphism on drug pharmacokinetics is by evaluating the blood and urine concentrations of the drug in subjects.

Testicular sperm aspiration was done in 13 men and was successful in only one, who had a deletion of azoospermia factor c.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our study found a fairly high prevalence of genetic abnormality in men with severe semen abnormalities and a correlation of genetic abnormalities with surgical sperm retrieval outcomes. These findings support the need for genetic screening of these men prior to embarking on surgical sperm retrieval and assisted reproductive technology intracytoplasmic sperm injection.",

DNA extracted from isolated cells were subjected to whole genome amplification using an isothermal amplification and strand displacement technology. Oligonucleotide primers bracketing the mutation were synthesized and used to amplify 162 base pairs (bp) polymerase chain reaction amplicons originating from each embryo which were subsequently sequenced to detect the presence or absence of the single base polymorphism.\nRESULTS: Three out of 12 embryos interrogated in this study were found to be normal while 9 were found to harbor the mutation in heterozygous condition. Implantation of one of the normal embryos following by chorionic villus sampling at 11th week of pregnancy indicated that the baby was free from c.1537G&gt;A; p.G513S mutation within the COL4A1 gene.\nCONCLUSIONS: Single-cell sequencing is a helpful tool for preimplantation embryo profiling.

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: BRCA mutation testing allows index patients and their families to be provided with appropriate cancer risk-reduction strategies. Because of the low prevalence of BRCA mutations in unselected breast cancer patients and the high cost of genetic testing, it is important to identify the subset of women who are likely to carry BRCA mutations. In the present study, we examined the association between BRCA1/2 germline mutations and the immunohistochemical features of breast cancer.\nMETHODS: In a retrospective review of 498 breast cancer patients who had undergone BRCA testing at Seoul National University Bundang Hospital between July 2003 and September 2012, we gathered immunohistochemical information on estrogen receptor (er), progesterone receptor (pr), her2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2), cytokeratin 5/6, egfr (epidermal growth factor receptor), and p53 status.\nRESULTS: Among the 411 patients eligible for the study, 50 (12.2%) had germline mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2. Of the 93 patients with triple-negative breast cancer (tnbc), 25 with BRCA1/2 mutations were identified (BRCA1, 20.4%; BRCA2, 6.5%). On univariate analysis, er, pr, cytokeratin 5/6, egfr, and tnbc were found to be related to BRCA1 mutations, but on multivariate analysis, only tnbc was significantly associated with BRCA1 mutations. Among patients with early-onset breast cancer or with a family history of breast or ovarian cancer, BRCA1 mutations were significantly more prevalent in the tnbc group than in the non-tnbc group.\nCONCLUSIONS: In the present study, tnbc was the only independent predictor of BRCA1 mutation in patients at high risk of hereditary breast and ovarian cancers. Other histologic features of basal-like breast cancer did not improve the estimate of BRCA1 mutation risk.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Genomic technologies are increasingly used to guide clinical decision-making in cancer control. Economic evidence about the cost-effectiveness of genomic technologies is limited, in part because of a lack of published comprehensive cost estimates. In the present micro-costing study, we used a time-and-motion approach to derive cost estimates for 3 genomic assays and processes-digital gene expression profiling (gep), fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish), and targeted capture sequencing, including bioinformatics analysis-in the context of lymphoma patient management.\nMETHODS: The setting for the study was the Department of Lymphoid Cancer Research laboratory at the BC Cancer Agency in Vancouver, British Columbia. Mean per-case hands-on time and resource measurements were determined from a series of direct observations of each assay. Per-case cost estimates were calculated using a bottom-up costing approach, with labour, capital and equipment, supplies and reagents, and overhead costs included.\nRESULTS: The most labour-intensive assay was found to be fish at 258.2 minutes per case, followed by targeted capture sequencing (124.1 minutes per case) and digital gep (14.9 minutes per case). Based on a historical case throughput of 180 cases annually, the mean per-case cost (2014 Canadian dollars) was estimated to be $1,029.16 for targeted capture sequencing and bioinformatics analysis, $596.60 for fish, and $898.35 for digital gep with an 807-gene code set.\nCONCLUSIONS: With the growing emphasis on personalized approaches to cancer management, the need for economic evaluations of high-throughput genomic assays is increasing. Through economic modelling and budget-impact analyses, the cost estimates presented here can be used to inform priority-setting decisions about the implementation of such assays in clinical practice.",

        "abstract": "\u03b2-lactams are antibiotic molecules able to inhibit cell wall biosynthesis. Among other mechanisms, resistance in Gram-negative bacteria is mostly associated with production of \u03b2-lactamase enzymes able to bind and hydrolyze the \u03b2-lactam ring. Extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamases extend this ability also to third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins, as well as to carbapenems and monobactams. Vibrio cholerae is the causative agent of epidemic cholera and a public health burden for developing countries like Bangladesh. Although appropriate oral or intravenous rehydration is the therapy of choice for cholera, severe infections and V. cholerae-associated septicemia are treated with antimicrobial drugs, including doxycycline, erythromycin, azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, and/or third-generation cephalosporins. In the years after the introduction of antibiotics in clinical practice, V. cholerae developed resistance to commonly used drugs worldwide mostly through gene acquisition via horizontal gene transfer. Reduced susceptibility of V. cholerae to third-generation cephalosporins has been occasionally documented. However, carbapenemase-producing V. cholerae has been reported at higher rates than resistance to extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactams, mainly associated with bla<sub>NDM-1</sub> emergence and successful plasmid dissemination. Recent findings suggest limited \u03b2-lactam resistance is present in V. cholerae O1 isolates collected during ecological and epidemiological surveillance in Bangladesh. However, a trend to intermediate-susceptibility insurgence was observed. Horizontal gene transfer of \u03b2-lactam resistance from enteric pathogens to environmental microorganisms should not be underrated, given the ability of V. cholerae to acquire new genetic information.",

Demographic data, family history of clubfoot in first-degree relatives, maternal educational level and brace compliance were enquired. Based on their medical files, the characteristics of the patients at the time of presentation such as age, possible associated neuromuscular disease or especial syndrome, severity of the deformity according to the Dimeglio grade and Pirani score, residual deformity after previous Ponseti method and number of casts needed for the correction were recorded.\nRESULTS: There were 83 boys (72.2%) and 32 girls (27.8%) with a male to female ratio of 2.6. The mean age at the initiation of treatment was 5.4 d (range: 1 to 60 d). The average number of casts applied to achieve complete correction of all clubfoot deformities was 4.2. Follow-up range was 11 to 60 mo. In total, 39 feet had recurrence with a minimum Dimeglio grade of 1 or Pirani score of 0.5 at the follow-up visit. More recurrence was observed in non-idiopathic clubfoot deformities (P = 0.001), non-compliance to wear braces (P &lt; 0.001), low educational level of mother (P = 0.033), increased number of casts (P &lt; 0.001), and more follow-up periods (P &lt; 0.001). No increase in the possibility of recurrence was observed when the previous unsuccessful casting was further treated using the Ponseti method (P = 0.091). Also, no significant correlation was found for variables of age (P = 0.763), Dimeglio grade (P = 0.875), and Pirani score (P = 0.624) obtaining at the beginning of the serial casting.\nCONCLUSION: Using the Ponseti method, non-idiopathic clubfoot, non-compliance to wear braces, low educational level of mother, increased number of casts and more follow-up periods had more association to possible increase in recurrence rate after correction of clubfoot deformity.",

We show here that the level of oxidized RNAs is markedly increased in a yeast decapping Kllsm4\u03941 mutant, which accumulates mRNAs, ages much faster that the wild type strain and undergoes regulated-cell-death. We also found that in Kllsm4\u03941 cells the mutation rate increases during chronological life span indicating that the capacity to handle oxidized RNAs in yeast declines with aging. Lowering intracellular ROS levels by antioxidants recovers the wild-type phenotype of mutant cells, including reduced amount of oxidized RNAs and lower mutation rate. Since mRNA oxidation was reported to occur in different neurodegenerative diseases, decapping-deficient cells may represent a useful tool for deciphering molecular mechanisms of cell response to such conditions, providing new insights into RNA modification-based pathogenesis.",

        "abstract": "Statin therapy is beneficial in reducing LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) levels and cardiovascular events, but it is associated with the risk of incident diabetes mellitus (DM). Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is characterized by genetically determined high levels of plasma LDL-C and a low prevalence of DM. LDL-C levels seem then inversely correlated with prevalence of DM. Familial hypobetalipoproteinemia (FHBL) represents the genetic mirror of FH in terms of LDL-C levels, very low in subjects carrying mutations of APOB, PCSK9 (FHBL1) or ANGPTL3 (FHBL2). This review explores the hypothesis that FHBL might represent also the genetic mirror of FH in terms of prevalence of DM and that it is expected to be increased in FHBL in comparison with the general population. A systematic review of published literature on FHBL was made by searching PubMed (1980-2016) for articles presenting clinical data on FHBL probands and relatives. The standardized prevalence rates of DM in FHBL1 were similar to those of the reference population, with a prevalence rate of 8.2 and 9.2%, respectively, while FHBL2 showed a 4.9% prevalence of DM. In conclusion, low LDL-C levels of FHBL do not seem connected to DM as it happens in subjects undergoing statin therapy and the diabetogenic effect of statins has to be explained by mechanisms that do not rely exclusively on the reduced levels of LDL-C. The review also summarizes the published data on the effects of FHBL on insulin sensitivity and the relationships between FH, statin therapy, FHBL1 and intracellular cholesterol metabolism, evaluating possible diabetogenic pathways.",

Currently, genetic manipulation of filamentous fungi is achieved via Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation methods usually employing antibiotic resistance markers. These methods are hardly usable for A. oryzae due to its strong resistance to the common antifungal compounds used for fungal transformation. In this study, we have constructed two binary vectors carrying the pyrG gene from A. oryzae as a biochemical marker than an antibiotic resistance marker, and an expression cassette for GFP or DsRed reporter gene under control of the constitutive gpdA promoter from Aspergillus nidulans. All components of these vectors are changeable to generate new versions for specific research purposes. The developed vectors are fully functional for heterologous expression of the GFP and DsRed fluorescent proteins in the uridine/uracil auxotrophic A. oryzae strain. Our study provides a new approach for A. oryzae transformation using pyrG as the selectable auxotrophic marker, A. tumefaciens as the DNA transfer tool and fungal spores as the transformation material.

Rennet coagulation time (RCT), curd-firming time (k 20) and curd firmness (a 30) were measured using Formagraph instrument, whereas ILCY were determined by a micromanufacturing protocol. About 10% of the milk samples did not coagulate within 30 min and 13% had zero value for k 20. The average ILCY was 36%. (Co)variance components of considered traits were estimated by fitting both single- and multiple-trait animal models. Flock-test date explained from 13% to 28% of the phenotypic variance for MCPs and 26% for ILCY, respectively. The largest value of heritability was estimated for RCT (0.23\u00b10.10), whereas it was about 0.15 for the other traits. Negative genetic correlations between RCT and a 30 (-0.80\u00b10.12), a 30 and k 20 (-0.91\u00b10.09), and a 30 and ILCY (-0.67\u00b10.08) were observed. Interesting genetic correlations between MCPs and milk composition (r G>0.40) were estimated for pH, NaCl and casein. Results of the present study suggest to use only one out of three MCPs to measure milk renneting ability, due to high genetic correlations among them. Moreover, negative correlations between ILCY and MCPs suggest that great care should be taken when using these methods to estimate cheese yield from small milk samples.",

        "abstract": "Understanding selection in the wild remains a major aim of evolutionary ecology and work by Ford and colleagues on the meadow brown butterfly Maniola jurtina did much to ignite this agenda. A great deal of their work was conducted during the 1950s on the Isles of Scilly. They documented island-specific wing-spot patterns that remained consistent over about a decade, but patterns on some islands changed after environmental perturbation. It was suggested that these wing-spot patterns reflected island-specific selection and that there was little migration between islands. However, genetic studies to test the underlying assumption of restricted migration are lacking and it is also unknown whether the originally described wing-spot patterns have persisted over time. We therefore collected female butterflies from five of Ford's original study locations, including three large islands (St Mary's, St Martin's and Tresco) and two small islands (Tean and St Helen's). Wing-spot patterns had not changed appreciably over time on three of the islands (two large and one small), but were significantly different on the other two. Furthermore, analysis of 176 amplified fragment length polymorphisms revealed significant genome-wide differentiation among the five islands. Our findings are consistent with Ford's conclusions that despite the close proximity of these islands, there is restricted gene flow among them.",

        "abstract": "The genetic breakdown of self-incompatibility (SI) and subsequent mating system shifts to inbreeding has intrigued evolutionary geneticists for decades. Most of our knowledge is derived from interspecific comparisons between inbreeding species and their outcrossing relatives, where inferences may be confounded by secondary mutations that arose after the initial loss of SI. Here, we study an intraspecific breakdown of SI and its consequences in North American Arabidopsis lyrata to test whether: (1) particular S-locus haplotypes are associated with the loss of SI and/or the shift to inbreeding; (2) a population bottleneck may have played a role in driving the transition to inbreeding; and (3) the mutation(s) underlying the loss of SI are likely to have occurred at the S-locus. Combining multiple approaches for genotyping, we found that outcrossing populations on average harbour 5 to 9 S-locus receptor kinase (SRK) alleles, but only two, S1 and S19, are shared by most inbreeding populations. Self-compatibility (SC) behaved genetically as a recessive trait, as expected from a loss-of-function mutation. Bulked segregant analysis in SC \u00d7 SI F2 individuals using deep sequencing confirmed that all SC plants were S1 homozygotes but not all S1 homozygotes were SC. This was also revealed in population surveys, where only a few S1 homozygotes were SC. Together with crossing data, this suggests that there is a recessive factor that causes SC that is physically unlinked to the S-locus. Overall, our results emphasise the value of combining classical genetics with advanced sequencing approaches to resolve long outstanding questions in evolutionary biology.",

However, off-target deaminations were detected more than 150\u2009bp away from the target site.

The spectrum of CHD patterns in DS varies widely worldwide; this variation could be due to sociodemographic, genetic and geographic factors.\nMETHODS: A six-year retrospective, descriptive study was carried out from December 2008 to October 2014, based on the Paediatric Unit CHD registry of Ibn Rochd University Hospital. Clinical, echocardiographic and outcomes data were collected and sorted according to confirmation of the syndrome.\nRESULTS: Among 2 156 patients with CHD, 128 were identified with Down syndrome.

The overall mortality rate was 14.1%.\nCONCLUSION: Our study confirmed that the profile and type of CHD in DS in the Moroccan setting exhibited slight differences in the distribution of these CHDs compared with European neighbours and other Western countries. Further studies are needed to determine which variables have an impact on these differences.",

        "abstract": "In polyandrous mating systems, sperm competition and cryptic female choice (CFC) are well recognized as postcopulatory evolutionary forces. However, it remains challenging to separate CFC from sperm competition and to estimate how much CFC influences insemination success because those processes usually occur inside the female's body. The Japanese pygmy squid, Idiosepius paradoxus, is an ideal species in which to separate CFC from sperm competition because sperm transfer by the male and sperm displacement by the female can be observed directly at an external location on the female's body. Here, we counted the number of spermatangia transferred to, removed from, and remaining on the female body during single copulation episodes. We measured behavioral and morphological characteristics of the male, such as duration of copulation and body size. Although males with larger body size and longer copulation time were capable of transferring larger amounts of sperm, females preferentially eliminated sperm from males with larger body size and shorter copulation time by spermatangia removal; thus, CFC could attenuate sperm precedence by larger males, whereas it reinforces sperm precedence by males with longer copulation time. Genetic paternity analysis revealed that fertilisation success for each male was correlated with remaining sperm volume that is adjusted by females after copulation.",

        "abstract": "In a recent testing in the metropolitan area of Naples, Italy, on 945 irregular immigrants or refugees, 87 HBsAg chronic carriers were identified, 53 of whom were infected by HBV-genotype E. The aim of the present study was to identify the genetic diversity of HBV-genotype E in these 53 immigrants. The 53 immigrant patients with HBV-genotype-E infection were born in Africa, central or eastern Asia, eastern Europe or Latin America. These patients had been seen for a clinical consultation at one of the four first-level units from January 2012 to 2013. The first dataset contained 53 HBV-S gene isolates plus 128 genotype/subgenotype specific reference sequences downloaded from the National Center for Biotechnology Information. The second dataset, comprising the 53 HBV-S gene isolates, previously classified as HBV-genotype E, was used to perform the time-scaled phylogeny reconstruction using a Bayesian approach. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all 53 HBV-S isolates belonged to HBV-genotype E. Bayes factor analysis showed that the relaxed clock exponential growth model fitted the data significantly better than the other models. The time-scaled Bayesian phylogenetic tree of the second dataset showed that the root of the tree dated back to the year 1990 (95% HPD:1984-2000). Four statistically supported clusters were identified. Cluster A dated back to 2012 (95% HPD:1997-2012); cluster B dated back to 2008 (95% HPD:2001-2015); cluster C to 2006 (95% HPD:1999-2013); cluster D to 2004 (95% HPD:1998-2011).

The review also highlights difficulties posed by issues pertaining to restricted participant numbers, variable phenotype and disease progression, and the identification and validation of study endpoints. Expert opinion: Translation of novel therapeutics for Duchenne muscular dystrophy and spinal muscular atrophy has been greatly advanced by multidisciplinary research, academic-industry partnerships and in particular, the engagement and support of the patient community. Sponsors, supporters and regulators are cooperating to deliver new drugs and identify and define meaningful outcome measures.

Recent clinical studies indicate that the severity of brain injury appear to be sex dependent, and that the male neonates are more susceptible to the effects of HI-related brain injury, resulting in more severe neurological outcomes as compared to females with comparable brain injuries. The development of reliable methods to isolate and maintain highly enriched populations of sexed hippocampal astrocytes is essential to understand the cellular basis of sex differences in the pathological consequences of neonatal HI. In this study, we describe a method for creating sex specific hippocampal astrocyte cultures that are subjected to a model of in-vitro ischemia, oxygen-glucose deprivation, followed by reoxygenation. Subsequent reactive astrogliosis was examined by immunostaining for the Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP) and S100B.

        "abstract": "Simple model organisms are instrumental for in vivo studies of developmental and cellular differentiation processes. Currently, the evolutionary distance to man of conventional invertebrate model systems and the complexity of genomes in vertebrates are critical challenges to modeling human normal and pathological conditions. The chordate Ciona intestinalis is an invertebrate chordate that emerged from a common ancestor with the vertebrates and may represent features at the interface between invertebrates and vertebrates. A common body plan with much simpler cellular and genomic composition should unveil gene regulatory network (GRN) links and functional genomics readouts explaining phenomena in the vertebrate condition. The compact genome of Ciona, a fixed embryonic lineage with few divisions and large cells, combined with versatile community tools foster efficient gene functional analyses in this organism. Here, we present several crucial methods for this promising model organism, which belongs to the closest sister group to vertebrates. We present protocols for transient transgenesis by electroporation, along with microinjection-mediated gene knockdown, which together provide the means to study gene function and genomic regulatory elements. We extend our protocols to provide information on how community databases are utilized for in silico design of gene regulatory or gene functional experiments. An example study demonstrates how novel information can be gained on the interplay, and its quantification, of selected neural factors conserved between Ciona and man. Furthermore, we show examples of differential subcellular localization in embryonic cells, following DNA electroporation in Ciona zygotes. Finally, we discuss the potential of these protocols to be adapted for tissue specific gene interference with emerging gene editing methods. The in vivo approaches in Ciona overcome major shortcomings of classical model organisms in the quest of unraveling conserved mechanisms in the chordate developmental program, relevant to stem cell research, drug discovery, and subsequent clinical application.",

This is a retrospective cohort study on maternal and neonatal outcomes of the twin pregnancies of 57 women aged \u226545 years compared to 114 younger women who gave birth in our institution between January 2011 and August 2015. Data were extracted from the real-time computerized database. The rates of hypertensive complications and pre-eclampsia (PE) were much higher in the study group compared to the controls (24/57 vs. 19/114, P=0.000 and 15/57 vs. 13/114, P=0.013, respectively). The respective incidence of very low birth weight (VLBW) was also significantly higher (14/114 vs. 12/228, P=0.021). Infants in the study group required four times more intubation and had a higher admission rate to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) compared to control infants (14/114 vs. 6/228 P=0.000 and 42/114 vs. 57/228, P=0.023, respectively). We conclude that women older than 45 years with twin pregnancies have higher maternal and perinatal complications with worse outcomes in comparison with younger women.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Health systems often fail to use evidence in clinical practice. In maternal and perinatal health, the majority of maternal, fetal and newborn mortality is preventable through implementing effective interventions. To meet this challenge, WHO's Department of Reproductive Health and Research partnered with the Knowledge Translation Program at St. Michael's Hospital (SMH), University of Toronto, Canada to establish a collaboration on knowledge translation (KT) in maternal and perinatal health, called the GREAT Network (Guideline-driven, Research priorities, Evidence synthesis, Application of evidence, and Transfer of knowledge). We applied a systematic approach incorporating evidence and theory to identifying barriers and facilitators to implementation of WHO maternal heath recommendations in four lower-income countries and to identifying implementation strategies to address these.\nMETHODS: We conducted a mixed-methods study in Myanmar, Uganda, Tanzania and Ethiopia. In each country, stakeholder surveys, focus group discussions and prioritization exercises were used, involving multiple groups of health system stakeholders (including administrators, policymakers, NGOs, professional associations, frontline healthcare providers and researchers).\nRESULTS: Despite differences in guideline priorities and contexts, barriers identified across countries were often similar. Health system level factors, including health workforce shortages, and need for strengthened drug and equipment procurement, distribution and management systems, were consistently highlighted as limiting the capacity of providers to deliver high-quality care. Evidence-based health policies to support implementation, and improve the knowledge and skills of healthcare providers were also identified. Stakeholders identified a range of tailored strategies to address local barriers and leverage facilitators.\nCONCLUSION: This approach to identifying barriers, facilitators and potential strategies for improving implementation proved feasible in these four lower-income country settings. Further evaluation of the impact of implementing these strategies is needed.",

        "abstract": "Helminth parasites are an assemblage of two major phyla of nematodes (also known as roundworms) and platyhelminths (also called flatworms). These parasites are a major human health burden, and infections caused by helminths are considered under neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). These infections are typified by limited clinical treatment options and threat of drug resistance. Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) are vital enzymes that decode genetic information and enable protein translation. The specific inhibition of pathogen aaRSs bores well for development of next generation anti-parasitics. Here, we have identified and annotated aaRSs and accessory proteins from Loa loa (nematode) and Schistosoma mansoni (flatworm) to provide a glimpse of these protein translation enzymes within these parasites. Using purified parasitic lysyl-tRNA synthetases (KRSs), we developed series of assays that address KRS enzymatic activity, oligomeric states, crystal structure and inhibition profiles. We show that L. loa and S. mansoni KRSs are potently inhibited by the fungal metabolite cladosporin. Our co-crystal structure of Loa loa KRS-cladosporin complex reveals key interacting residues and provides a platform for structure-based drug development. This work hence provides a new direction for both novel target discovery and inhibitor development against eukaryotic pathogens that include L. loa and S. mansoni.",

In this study, two full-sib families and one breeding population of maritime pine were used to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for height growth and stem straightness, through linkage analysis (LA) and linkage disequilibrium (LD) mapping approaches.\nRESULTS: The populations used for LA consisted of two unrelated three-generation full-sib families (n = 197 and n = 477). These populations were assessed for height growth or stem straightness and genotyped for 248 and 217 markers, respectively. The population used for LD mapping consisted of 661 founders of the first and second generations of the breeding program. This population was phenotyped for the same traits and genotyped for 2,498 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers corresponding to 1,652 gene loci. The gene-based reference genetic map of maritime pine was used to localize and compare the QTLs detected by the two approaches, for both traits. LA identified three QTLs for stem straightness and two QTLs for height growth. The LD study yielded seven significant associations (P \u2264 0.001): four for stem straightness and three for height growth. No colocalisation was found between QTLs identified by LA and SNPs detected by LD mapping for the same trait.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first comparison of LA and LD mapping approaches in maritime pine, highlighting the complementary nature of these two approaches for deciphering the genetic architecture of two mandatory traits of the breeding program.",

        "abstract": "Quaternary climate fluctuations have profoundly affected the current distribution patterns and genetic structures of many plant and animal species in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) and adjacent mountain ranges, e.g. Tianshan (TSR), Altay, etc. In this greater area disjunct distributions are prominent but have nevertheless received little attention with respect to the historical processes involved. Here, we focus on Pedicularis kansuensis to test whether the current QTP and TSR disjunction is the result of a recent Holocene range expansion involving dispersal across arid land bridge(s) or a Pleistocene range fragmentation involving persistence in refugia. Two chloroplast DNA spacers were sequenced for 319 individuals from 34 populations covering the entire distribution range of this species in China. We found a total of 17 haplotypes of which all occurred in the QTP, and only five in the TSR. Overall genetic diversity was high (HT = 0.882, HS = 0.559) and higher in the QTP than in the TSR. Genetic differentiation among regions and populations was relatively low (GST = 0.366) and little evidence for a phylogeographic pattern emerged. The divergence times for the four main lineages could be dated to the early Pleistocene. Surprisingly, the two ubiquitous haplotypes diverged just before or around the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and were found in different phylogenetic lineages. The Species Distribution Model suggested a disappearance of P. kansuensis from the TSR during the LGM in contrast to a relatively constant potential distribution in the QTP. We conclude that P. kansuensis colonized the TSR after the LGM. The improbable long-distance dispersal by wind or water across arid land seed flow may well have had birds or men as vector.",

Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is the precise technique for assessing bone mineral content (BMC) in preterm infants, but is not widely available.\nAIM: To investigate the clinical and biochemical parameters, including bone metabolism markers as potential predictors of BMC, in preterm infants up to 3 months corrected age (CA).\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Ca-P homeostasis, iPTH, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, osteocalcin, N-terminal propeptide, cross-linked C-telopeptide and amino-terminal pro C-type natriuretic peptide and the DXA scans were prospectively performed in 184 preterm infants (\u2264 34 weeks' gestation) between term age and 3 mo CA. Lower bone mass was defined as BMC below or equal to respective median value for the whole study group, rounded to the nearest whole number.\nRESULTS: The appropriate quality DXA scans were available for 160 infants (87%) examined at term and for 130 (71%) tested at 3 mo CA. Higher iPTH level was the only independent predictor of lower BMC at term, whereas lower BMC at 3 mo CA was associated both with lower urinary phosphate excretion and higher serum osteocalcin level. ROC analysis showed that iPTH >43.6 pg/mL provided 40% sensitivity and 88% specificity in identification of preterm infants with lower BMC at term. In turn, urinary phosphate excretion (TRP>97% or UP/Cr \u22640.74 mg/mg) and serum osteocalcin >172 ng/mL provided 40% sensitivity and 93% specificity in identification of infants with decreased BMC at 3 mo CA.\nCONCLUSION: Serum iPTH might to be a simple predictor of reduced BMC in preterm infants at term age, but urinary phosphate excretion and serum osteocalcin might predict reduced BMC at 3 mo CA. These results represent a promising diagnostic tool based on simple, widely available biochemical measurements for bone mass assessment in preterm infants.",

Paracrine signaling by CDC secreted exosomes may contribute to improved cardiac function. However, it has not yet been demonstrated by a genetic approach that exosome release contributes to the therapeutic effect of transplanted CDCs. By employing a lentiviral knockdown (KD) strategy against neutral spingomyelinase 2 (nSMase2), a crucial gene in exosome secretion, we have defined the role of physiologically secreted human CDC-derived exosomes on cardiac fibroblast, endothelial cell and primary cardiomyocyte proliferation, cell death, migration and angiogenesis using a series of in vitro coculture assays. We found that secretion of hCDC-derived exosomes was effectively inhibited by nSMase2 lentiviral KD and shRNAi expression was stable and constitutive. hCDC exosome release contributed to the angiogenic and pro-migratory effects of hCDCs on HUVECs, decreased proliferation of fibroblasts, and decreased apoptosis of cardiomyocytes. These in vitro reactions support a role for exosome secretion as a paracrine mechanism of stem cell-mediated cardiac repair in vivo. Importantly, we have established a novel tool to test constitutive inhibition of exosome secretion in stem cell populations in animal models of cardiac disease.",

Levels of ADHD symptoms typically decline across childhood and adolescence, although they remain elevated for some individuals. The determinants of symptom persistence and decline are not yet fully understood.\nOBJECTIVES: To test the hypothesis that genetic risk variant load for ADHD (indexed by polygenic risk scores [PRS]), but not for other psychiatric disorders, is associated with population-based ADHD symptom trajectories across childhood and adolescence, and to examine whether higher genetic liability for ADHD is correlated with total number of additional neurodevelopmental disorders (multimorbidity) in childhood.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, an ongoing prospective population-based cohort study, has been collecting data on 14\u202f701 children, including 9757 with data on symptoms of ADHD at multiple time points, since September 6, 1990. The primary exposure variables, PRS, were generated using results of a genome-wide association study from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium. Childhood multimorbidity scores (ages 7-9 years) were measured by total impairments in 4 domains known to share genetic liability with ADHD: IQ, social communication, pragmatic language, and conduct. Data analysis was conducted from March 1 to September 8, 2016.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptom trajectories from ages 4 to 17 years (7 time points).\nRESULTS: Among 9757 children with data on symptoms of ADHD at multiple time points (age range, 4-17 years; 4968 boys and 4789 girls), 4 ADHD symptom trajectories were identified: low (82.6%), intermediate (7.7%), childhood-limited (5.8%), and persistent (3.9%). Mean (SE) PRS for ADHD were higher in children in the persistent trajectory (0.254 [0.069]) compared with each of the other 3 trajectories (low, -0.018 [0.014], \u03c721\u2009=\u200914.67, P\u2009<\u2009.001, odds ratio, 1.31; intermediate, 0.054 [0.055], \u03c721\u2009=\u20094.70, P\u2009=\u2009.03, odds ratio, 1.22; and childhood-limited, 0.017 [0.060], \u03c721\u2009=\u20096.50, P\u2009=\u2009.01, odds ratio, 1.27). Findings were specific to PRS for ADHD; PRS for other psychiatric conditions did not differ across trajectories. The proportion of children with multimorbidity was also highest in those in the persistent trajectory (42.5%; 95% CI, 33.9%-51.1%; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and was associated with persistence of ADHD symptoms independent of PRS.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Persistence of ADHD symptoms across childhood and adolescence in the general population is associated with higher PRS for ADHD. Childhood multimorbidity was also associated with persistence of ADHD symptoms and may help to identify children with ADHD whose symptoms are most likely to continue into adolescence.",

Moreover, protein overexpression of RHOA was reported in Chinese populations, while RHOA mutations were found in Caucasian GC tumors. To develop evidence-based precision medicine for heterogeneous cancers, we established a systematic approach to integrate transcriptomic and genomic data.

        "abstract": "Epigenetics is the study of heritable and non-heritable genetic coding that is additive to information contained within classical DNA base pair sequences. Differential methylation has a fundamental role in the development and outcome of malignancies, chronic and degenerative diseases and aging. DNA methylation can be measured accurately and easily via various molecular methods and has become a key technology for research and healthcare delivery, with immediate roles in the elucidation of disease natural history, diagnostics and drug discovery. This review focuses on cancers of the lower genital tract, for which the most epigenetic information exists. DNA methylation has been proposed as a triage for women infected with human papillomavirus (HPV) and may eventually directly complement or replace HPV screening as a one-step molecular diagnostic and prognostic test. Methylation of human genes is strongly associated with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and cancer. Of the more than 100 human methylation biomarker genes tested so far in cervical tissue, close to 20 have been reported in different studies, and approximately 10 have been repeatedly shown to have elevated methylation in cervical cancers and high-grade CIN (CIN2 and CIN3), most prominently CADM1, EPB41L3, FAM19A4, MAL, miR-124, PAX1 and SOX1. Obtaining consistent performance data from the literature is quite difficult because most methylation studies used a variety of different assay methodologies and had incomplete and/or biased clinical specimen sets, varying assay thresholds and disparate target gene regions. There have been relatively few validation studies of DNA methylation biomarkers in large population-based screening studies, but an encouraging development more recently is the execution of well-designed studies to test the true performance of the markers in real-world settings. Methylation of HPV genes, especially HPV16, HPV18, HPV31, HPV33 and HPV45, in disease progression has been a major focus of research. Elevated methylation of the HPV16 L1 and L2 open reading frames, in particular, is associated with CIN2, CIN3 and invasive cancer. Essentially all cancers have high levels of methylation for human genes and for driver HPV types, which suggests that quantitative methylation tests may have utility in predicting CIN2 and CIN3 that are likely to progress. It is still early in the process of development of methylation biomarkers, but already they are showing strong promise as a universal and systematic approach to molecular triage, applicable to all cancers, not just cancer of the cervix. DNA methylation testing is better than HPV genotyping triage and is competitive with or complementary to other approaches such as cytology and p16 staining. Genome-wide studies are underway to systematically expand methylation classifier panels and find the best combinations of biomarkers. Methylation testing is likely to show big improvements in performance in the next 5 years.",

        "abstract": "Although human tumours are shaped by the genetic evolution of cancer cells, evidence also suggests that they display hierarchies related to developmental pathways and epigenetic programs in which cancer stem cells (CSCs) can drive tumour growth and give rise to differentiated progeny. Yet, unbiased evidence for CSCs in solid human malignancies remains elusive. Here we profile 4,347 single cells from six IDH1 or IDH2 mutant human oligodendrogliomas by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and reconstruct their developmental programs from genome-wide expression signatures. We infer that most cancer cells are differentiated along two specialized glial programs, whereas a rare subpopulation of cells is undifferentiated and associated with a neural stem cell expression program. Cells with expression signatures for proliferation are highly enriched in this rare subpopulation, consistent with a model in which CSCs are primarily responsible for fuelling the growth of oligodendroglioma in humans. Analysis of copy number variation (CNV) shows that distinct CNV sub-clones within tumours display similar cellular hierarchies, suggesting that the architecture of oligodendroglioma is primarily dictated by developmental programs. Subclonal point mutation analysis supports a similar model, although a full phylogenetic tree would be required to definitively determine the effect of genetic evolution on the inferred hierarchies. Our single-cell analyses provide insight into the cellular architecture of oligodendrogliomas at single-cell resolution and support the cancer stem cell model, with substantial implications for disease management.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To describe the natural history, antenatal and postnatal therapy, and clinical outcomes of Australian patients with fetomaternal/neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia (NAIT) recorded in the Australian NAIT registry.\nMETHODS: Analysis of registry data of Australian mothers treated antenatally for NAIT and any fetus/newborn with thrombocytopenia (TCP) and maternal human platelet antigen (HPA) antibodies.\nRESULTS: Ninety four potential cases (91 pregnancies; three twin pregnancies) were registered between December 2004 and September 2015 with 76 confirmed or treated as NAIT. NAIT was frequently unanticipated (44 cases, 58%), whilst 32 cases (42%) were anticipated due to personal or family history. In 70/76 cases, the diagnosis of NAIT was made based on HPA antibody results; anti-HPA-1a was most commonly detected (58/70, 82%), followed by anti-HPA-5b (5/70, 7%). Intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) was detected in seven cases (9%). Maternal antenatal therapy resulted in improved clinical outcomes. For antenatally treated cases, whilst 10/29 (34%) neonates had severe TCP, only one ICH was detected.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study provides data on contemporary \"real world\" management of Australian mothers and babies with NAIT. Antenatal IVIG therapy was associated with better neonatal outcomes. Maternal side-effects and treatment costs were substantial.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Whole-genome sequencing is increasingly used in clinical diagnosis of tuberculosis and study of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC). MTC consists of several genetically homogenous mycobacteria species which can cause tuberculosis in humans and animals. Regions of difference (RDs) are commonly regarded as gold standard genetic markers for MTC classification.\nRESULTS: We develop RD-Analyzer, a tool that can accurately infer the species and lineage of MTC isolates from sequence reads based on the presence and absence of a set of 31 RDs. Applied on a publicly available diverse set of 377 sequenced MTC isolates from known major species and lineages, RD-Analyzer achieved an accuracy of 98.14\u00a0% (370/377) in species prediction and a concordance of 98.47\u00a0% (257/261) in Mycobacterium tuberculosis lineage prediction compared to predictions based on single nucleotide polymorphism markers. By comparing respective sequencing read depths on each genomic position between isolates of different sublineages, we were able to identify the known RD markers in different sublineages of Lineage 4 and provide support for six potential delineating markers having high sensitivities and specificities for sublineage prediction. An extended version of RD-Analyzer was thus developed to allow user-defined RDs for lineage prediction.\nCONCLUSIONS: RD-Analyzer is a useful and accurate tool for species, lineage and sublineage prediction using known RDs of MTC from sequence reads and is extendable to accepting user-defined RDs for analysis.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In the biological experiments of soybean species, molecular markers are widely used to verify the soybean genome or construct its genetic map. Among a variety of molecular markers, insertions and deletions (InDels) are preferred with the advantages of wide distribution and high density at the whole-genome level. Hence, the problem of detecting InDels based on next-generation sequencing data is of great importance for the design of InDel markers. To tackle it, this paper integrated machine learning techniques with existing software and developed two algorithms for InDel detection, one is the best F-score method (BF-M) and the other is the Support Vector Machine (SVM) method (SVM-M), which is based on the classical SVM model.\nRESULTS: The experimental results show that the performance of BF-M was promising as indicated by the high precision and recall scores, whereas SVM-M yielded the best performance in terms of recall and F-score. Moreover, based on the InDel markers detected by SVM-M from soybeans that were collected from 56 different regions, highly polymorphic loci were selected to construct an InDel marker database for soybean.\nCONCLUSIONS: Compared to existing software tools, the two algorithms proposed in this work produced substantially higher precision and recall scores, and remained stable in various types of genomic regions. Moreover, based on SVM-M, we have constructed a database for soybean InDel markers and published it for academic research.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Bacteria rely on efficient gene regulatory mechanisms to switch between genetic programs when they are facing new environments. Although this regulation can occur at many different levels, one of the key steps is the initiation of transcription. Identification of the first nucleotide transcribed by the RNA polymerase is therefore essential to understand the underlying regulatory processes, since this provides insight on promoter strength and binding sites for transcriptional regulators, and additionally reveals the exact 5' untranslated region of the transcripts, which often contains elements that regulate translation.\nRESULTS: Here we present data from a novel TSS-EMOTE assay (Transcription Start Specific Exact Mapping Of Transcriptome Ends) to precisely map the transcription initiation sites of four entire transcriptomes. TSS-EMOTE is a variation of the dRNA-seq method, which has been combined with the EMOTE protocol, in order to increase detection of longer transcripts and limit biases introduced by PCR amplification of the Illumina sequencing library. Using TSS-EMOTE, 2018 promoters were detected in the opportunistic pathogen Staphylococcus aureus, and detailed consensus sequences could be obtained for the RNA polymerase recognition elements (e.g. sigma factor binding sites). The data also revealed a 94\u00a0nt median length of the 5' untranslated region in S. aureus, giving important insights for future work on translational regulation. Additionally, the transcriptomes of three other opportunistic pathogens, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Acinetobacter baumannii and Enterobacter aerogenes, were examined, and the identified promoter locations were then used to generate a map of the operon structure for each of the four organisms.\nCONCLUSIONS: Mapping transcription start sites, and subsequent correlation with the genomic sequence, provides a multitude of important information about the regulation of gene expression, both at the transcriptional and translational level, by defining 5' untranslated regions and sigma-factor binding sites. We have here mapped transcription start sites in four important pathogens using TSS-EMOTE, a method that works with both long and 3'-phosphorylated RNA molecules, and which incorporates Unique Molecular Identifiers (UMIs) to allow unbiased quantification.",

Since the middle of the last century, different diagnostic concepts for vascular dementia and related syndromes were put forward, yet no widely accepted diagnostic consensus exists to date.\nDISCUSSION: Several international efforts, reviewed herein, are ongoing to define cognitive impairment due to cerebrovascular disease in its different stages and subtypes. The role of biomarkers is also being discussed, including cerebrospinal fluid proteins, structural and functional brain imaging, and genetic markers. The influence of risk factors, such as diet, exercise and different comorbidities, is emphasised by population-based research, and lifestyle changes are considered for the treatment and prevention of dementia.\nCONCLUSION: To improve the diagnosis and management of vascular cognitive impairment, further progress has to be made in understanding the relevant pathomechanisms, including shared mechanisms with Alzheimer's disease; bringing together fragmented research initiatives in coordinated international programs; testing if known risk factors are modifiable in prospective interventional studies; and defining the pre-dementia and pre-clinical stages in line with the concept of mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease.",

In this study, we evaluated 760 of cases of DLBCL and other aggressive B-cell lymphomas using a relatively uniform immunohistochemical panel and genetic methods. We assessed the frequency of different subtypes and locations and documented distinctive immunophenotypic and genetic findings of these cases. Most cases in the study group were DLBCL (89%), including 38 CD5+ DLBCL, 28 T-cell/histiocyte-rich large B-cell lymphomas, and 33 Epstein-Barr virus-positive DLBCL (including 6 cases in elderly patients). The study also included 39 Burkitt lymphoma and 39 cases of double-hit lymphoma. In general, our results support the World Health Organization classification approach as well as other studies of DLBCL.

Participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while performing a continuous performance task with emotional and neutral distracters. Region-of-interest analyses were performed for the bilateral amygdala and for subregions of the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex.\nRESULTS: Overall, no group differences in bilateral amygdala and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (Brodmann area [BA] 45/47) activation during emotional or neutral stimuli were observed. The BP-I group exhibited lower right pregenual anterior cingulate cortex activation compared with the HC group, and activation in the left BA 44 was greater in the ARH and ARD groups compared with the HC group. BP-I and ARD groups exhibited blunted activation in the right BA 10 compared with the ARH group.\nCONCLUSION: During emotional processing, amygdala and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (BA 45/47) activation does not differ in youth with or at increasing risk for BP-I. However, blunted pregenual anterior cingulate cortex activation in first-episode mania could represent an illness biomarker, and greater prefrontal BA 10 and BA 44 activations in at-risk youth could represent a biomarker of risk or resilience warranting additional investigation in prospective longitudinal studies.",

OMM dose was the proportion of enteral intake that consisted of OMM from birth to 36\u2005weeks postmenstrual age (PMA) or discharge, whichever occurred first. BPD was defined as the receipt of oxygen and/or positive pressure ventilation at 36\u2005weeks PMA. NICU costs included hospital and physician costs.\nRESULTS: The cohort consisted of 254 VLBW infants with mean birth weight 1027\u00b1257\u2005g and gestational age 27.8\u00b12.5\u2005weeks. Multivariable logistic regression demonstrated a 9.5% reduction in the odds of BPD for every 10% increase in OMM dose (OR 0.905 (0.824 to 0.995)). After controlling for demographic and clinical factors, BPD was associated with an increase of US$41\u2005929 in NICU costs.\nCONCLUSIONS: Increased dose of OMM feedings from birth to 36\u2005weeks PMA was associated with a reduction in the odds of BPD in VLBW infants. Thus, high-dose OMM feeding may be an inexpensive, effective strategy to help reduce the risk of this costly multifactorial morbidity.",

In particular, the PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) p.G411S (c.1231G>A, rs45478900) mutation has been reported in families with dominant inheritance patterns of Parkinson's disease, suggesting that it might confer a sizeable disease risk when present on only one allele. We examined families with PINK1 p.G411S and conducted a genetic association study with 2560 patients with Parkinson's disease and 2145 control subjects. Heterozygous PINK1 p.G411S mutations markedly increased Parkinson's disease risk (odds ratio = 2.92, P = 0.032); significance remained when supplementing with results from previous studies on 4437 additional subjects (odds ratio = 2.89, P = 0.027). We analysed primary human skin fibroblasts and induced neurons from heterozygous PINK1 p.G411S carriers compared to PINK1 p.Q456X heterozygotes and PINK1 wild-type controls under endogenous conditions. While cells from PINK1 p.Q456X heterozygotes showed reduced levels of PINK1 protein and decreased initial kinase activity upon mitochondrial damage, stress-response was largely unaffected over time, as expected for a recessive loss-of-function mutation. By contrast, PINK1 p.G411S heterozygotes showed no decrease of PINK1 protein levels but a sustained, significant reduction in kinase activity. Molecular modelling and dynamics simulations as well as multiple functional assays revealed that the p.G411S mutation interferes with ubiquitin phosphorylation by wild-type PINK1 in a heterodimeric complex. This impairs the protective functions of the PINK1/parkin-mediated mitochondrial quality control. Based on genetic and clinical evaluation as well as functional and structural characterization, we established p.G411S as a rare genetic risk factor with a relatively large effect size conferred by a partial dominant-negative function phenotype.",

Out of all FNMTC cases, only 5% in the syndromic form has well-studied driver germline mutations. These associated syndromes include Cowden syndrome, familial adenomatous polyposis, Gardner syndrome, Carney complex type 1, Werner syndrome and DICER1 syndrome. It is important for the clinician to recognize these phenotypes so that genetic counseling and testing can be initiated to enable surveillance for associated malignancies and genetic testing of family members. The susceptibility chromosomal loci and genes of 95% of FNMTC cases remain to be characterized.

        "abstract": "The hypothesis that dietary tomato consumption or the intake of the carotenoid lycopene inhibits prostate cancer arose from epidemiologic studies and is supported by preclinical rodent experiments and in vitro mechanistic studies. We hypothesize that variation in activity of carotenoid cleavage enzymes, such as \u03b2-carotene 9',10'-oxygenase (BCO2), may alter the impact of dietary tomato and lycopene on prostate carcinogenesis and therefore examined this relationship in the TRAMP model. Starting at 3 weeks of age, TRAMP:Bco2+/+ and TRAMP:Bco2-/- mice were fed either AIN-93G control, or semipurified diets containing 10% tomato powder or 0.25% lycopene beadlets until 18 weeks of age. Both tomato- and lycopene-fed TRAMP:Bco2-/- mice had significantly greater serum concentrations of total, 5-cis, other cis, and all-trans lycopene than TRAMP:Bco2+/+ mice. Tomato- and lycopene-fed mice had a lower incidence of prostate cancer compared with the control-fed mice. Although Bco2 genotype alone did not significantly change prostate cancer outcome in the control AIN-93G-fed mice, the abilities of lycopene and tomato feeding to inhibit prostate carcinogenesis were significantly attenuated by the loss of Bco2 (P<sub>interaction</sub> = 0.0004 and 0.0383, respectively). Overall, dietary tomato and lycopene inhibited the progression of prostate cancer in TRAMP in a Bco2 genotype-specific manner, potentially implicating the anticancer activity of lycopene cleavage products. This study suggests that genetic variables impacting carotenoid metabolism and accumulation can impact anticancer activity and that future efforts devoted to understanding the interface between tomato carotenoid intake, host genetics, and metabolism will be necessary to clearly elucidate their interactive roles in human prostate carcinogenesis.

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Previous studies in adolescents were not adequately powered to accurately disentangle genetic and environmental influences on smoking initiation (SI) across adolescence.\nMETHODS: Mega-analysis of pooled genetically informative data on SI was performed, with structural equation modeling, to test equality of prevalence and correlations across cultural backgrounds, and to estimate the significance and effect size of genetic and environmental effects according to the classical twin study, in adolescent male and female twins from same-sex and opposite-sex twin pairs (N = 19 313 pairs) between ages 10 and 19, with 76 358 longitudinal assessments between 1983 and 2007, from 11 population-based twin samples from the United States, Europe, and Australia.\nRESULTS: Although prevalences differed between samples, twin correlations did not, suggesting similar etiology of SI across developed countries. The estimate of additive genetic contributions to liability of SI increased from approximately 15% to 45% from ages 13 to 19. Correspondingly, shared environmental factors accounted for a substantial proportion of variance in liability to SI at age 13 (70%) and gradually less by age 19 (40%).\nCONCLUSIONS: Both additive genetic and shared environmental factors significantly contribute to variance in SI throughout adolescence. The present study, the largest genetic epidemiological study on SI to date, found consistent results across 11 studies for the etiology of SI. Environmental factors, especially those shared by siblings in a family, primarily influence SI variance in early adolescence, while an increasing role of genetic factors is seen at later ages, which has important implications for prevention strategies.\nIMPLICATIONS: This is the first study to find evidence of genetic factors in liability to SI at ages as young as 12. It also shows the strongest evidence to date for decay of effects of the shared environment from early adolescence to young adulthood. We found remarkable consistency of twin correlations across studies reflecting similar etiology of liability to initiate smoking across different cultures and time periods. Thus familial factors strongly contribute to individual differences in who starts to smoke with a gradual increase in the impact of genetic factors and a corresponding decrease in that of the shared environment.",

Previous studies confirmed that the bla<sub>NDM-1</sub> gene is typically carried in plasmids but rarely in chromosome. We discovered a multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli strain Y5, originating from a urine sample and containing the bla<sub>NDM-1</sub> gene, which did not transfer by either conjugation or electrotransformation. We confirmed the possibility of its chromosome location by S1-pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and XbaI-PFGE, followed by Southern blotting.

        "abstract": "Over the past decade, a tremendous amount of resources have been dedicated to the pursuit of developing genomic signatures that effectively match patients with targeted therapies. Although dozens of therapies that target DNA mutations have been developed, the practice of studying single candidate genes has limited our understanding of cancer. Moreover, many studies of multiple-gene signatures have been conducted for the purpose of identifying prognostic risk cohorts, and thus are limited for selecting personalized treatments. Existing statistical methods for treatment selection often model treatment-by-covariate interactions that are difficult to specify, and require prohibitively large patient cohorts. In this article, we describe a Bayesian predictive failure time model for treatment selection that integrates multiple-gene signatures. Our approach relies on a heuristic measure of similarity that determines the extent to which historically treated patients contribute to the outcome prediction of new patients. The similarity measure, which can be obtained from existing clustering methods, imparts robustness to the underlying stochastic data structure, which enhances feasibility in the presence of small samples. Performance of the proposed method is evaluated in simulation studies, and its application is demonstrated through a study of lung squamous cell carcinoma. Our Bayesian predictive failure time approach is shown to effectively leverage genomic signatures to match patients to the therapies that are most beneficial for prolonging their survival.",

        "abstract": "As most RNA structures are elusive to structure determination, obtaining solvent accessible surface areas (ASAs) of nucleotides in an RNA structure is an important first step to characterize potential functional sites and core structural regions. Here, we developed RNAsnap, the first machine-learning method trained on protein-bound RNA structures for solvent accessibility prediction. Built on sequence profiles from multiple sequence alignment (RNAsnap-prof), the method provided robust prediction in fivefold cross-validation and an independent test (Pearson correlation coefficients, r, between predicted and actual ASA values are 0.66 and 0.63, respectively). Application of the method to 6178 mRNAs revealed its positive correlation to mRNA accessibility by dimethyl sulphate (DMS) experimentally measured in vivo (r = 0.37) but not in vitro (r = 0.07), despite the lack of training on mRNAs and the fact that DMS accessibility is only an approximation to solvent accessibility. We further found strong association across coding and noncoding regions between predicted solvent accessibility of the mutation site of a single nucleotide variant (SNV) and the frequency of that variant in the population for 2.2 million SNVs obtained in the 1000 Genomes Project. Moreover, mapping solvent accessibility of RNAs to the human genome indicated that introns, 5' cap of 5' and 3' cap of 3' untranslated regions, are more solvent accessible, consistent with their respective functional roles. These results support conformational selections as the mechanism for the formation of RNA-protein complexes and highlight the utility of genome-scale characterization of RNA tertiary structures by RNAsnap.

        "abstract": "Ion channels represent the molecular entities that give rise to the cardiac action potential, the fundamental cellular electrical event in the heart. The concerted function of these channels leads to normal cyclical excitation and resultant contraction of cardiac muscle. Research into cardiac ion channel regulation and mutations that underlie disease pathogenesis has greatly enhanced our knowledge of the causes and clinical management of cardiac arrhythmia. Here we review the molecular determinants, pathogenesis, and pharmacology of congenital Long QT Syndrome. We examine mechanisms of dysfunction associated with three critical cardiac currents that comprise the majority of congenital Long QT Syndrome cases: 1) I<sub>Ks</sub>, the slow delayed rectifier current; 2) I<sub>Kr</sub>, the rapid delayed rectifier current; and 3) I<sub>Na</sub>, the voltage-dependent sodium current. Less common subtypes of congenital Long QT Syndrome affect other cardiac ionic currents that contribute to the dynamic nature of cardiac electrophysiology. Through the study of mutations that cause congenital Long QT Syndrome, the scientific community has advanced understanding of ion channel structure-function relationships, physiology, and pharmacological response to clinically employed and experimental pharmacological agents. Our understanding of congenital Long QT Syndrome continues to evolve rapidly and with great benefits: genotype-driven clinical management of the disease has improved patient care as precision medicine becomes even more a reality.",

In this quiescent state, the viral genome persists as a circular, histone-associated episome, and transcription of viral lytic cycle genes is largely suppressed through epigenetic processes. Periodically, latent virus undergoes reactivation whereby lytic genes are activated and viral replication occurs. In this Gem, we review recent evidence that mechanisms governing the initial transcription of lytic genes are distinct from those of de novo infection and directly link reactivation to neuronal stress response pathways. We also discuss evidence that lytic cycle gene expression can be uncoupled from the full reactivation program, arguing for a less sharply bimodal definition of latency.",

Therefore, reformulation of culture media or modification of the mineral content might be a breakthrough to improve in vitro multiplication of G \u00d7 N15 (garnem). We found artificial neural network in combination of genetic algorithm (ANN-GA) as a very precise and powerful modeling system for optimizing the culture medium, So that modeling the effects of MS mineral salts ([Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], Ca2+, K+, [Formula: see text], Mg2+, and Cl-) on in vitro multiplication parameters (the number of microshoots per explant, average length of microshoots, weight of calluses derived from the base of stem explants, and quality index of plantlets) of G \u00d7 N15.

Understanding host factors that predispose to herpes zoster may permit development of more effective prevention strategies. Our objective was to examine mitochondrial haplogroups as a potential host factor related to herpes zoster incidence. Methods. \u2003Study participants were drawn from BioVU, a deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) biobank connected to deidentified electronic medical records (EMRs) from Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Our study used 9691 Caucasian individuals with herpes zoster status determined by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes 053-053.9. Cases and controls were matched on sex and date of birth within 5 years. Mitochondrial haplogroups were defined from mitochondrial DNA variants genotyped on the Illumina 660W or Illumina Infinium Human-Exome Beadchip. Sex and date of birth were extracted from the EMR. Results. \u2003European mitochondrial haplogroup H had a protective association with herpes zoster status (odds ratio [OR] = .82; 95% confidence interval [CI], .71-.94; P = .005), whereas haplogroup clade IWX was a risk factor for herpes zoster status (OR = 1.38; 95% CI, 1.07-1.77; P = .01).

        "abstract": "Endogenous hormone secretion proteins along with stress and defense proteins play predominant role in banana embryogenesis. This study reveals the underlying molecular mechanism during transition from vegetative to embryogenic state. Banana (Musa spp.) is well known globally as a food fruit crop for millions. The requirement of quality planting material of banana is enormous. Although mass multiplication through tissue culture is in vogue, high-throughput techniques like somatic embryogenesis (SE) as a mass multiplication tool needs to be improved. Apart from clonal propagation, SE has extensive applications in genetic improvement and mutation. SE in banana is completely genome-dependent and most of the commercial cultivars exhibit recalcitrance. Thus, understanding the molecular basis of embryogenesis in Musa will help to develop strategies for mass production of quality planting material. In this study, differentially expressed proteins between embryogenic calli (EC) and non-embryogenic calli (NEC) with respect to the explant, immature male flower buds (IMFB), of cv. Grand Naine (AAA) were determined using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE). The 2DE results were validated through qRT-PCR. In total, 65 proteins were identified: 42 were highly expressed and 23 were less expressed in EC compared to NEC and IMFB. qRT-PCR analysis of five candidate proteins, upregulated in EC, were well correlated with expression at transcript level. Further analysis of proteins showed that embryogenesis in banana is associated with the control of oxidative stress. The regulation of ROS scavenging system and protection of protein structure occurred in the presence of heat shock proteins. Alongside, high accumulation of stress-related cationic peroxidase and plant growth hormone-related proteins like indole-3-pyruvate monooxygenase and adenylate isopentenyltransferase in EC revealed the association with the induction of SE.",

Incidence of MM and MGUS is higher among patients with autoimmune disease. The aim of this study was to determine whether a history of autoimmunity has an impact on survival in MM and MGUS. Using high-quality national Swedish registries, we identified 8367 patients with MM, 18,768 patients with MGUS, and 110,251 matched control subjects, and obtained information on previous autoimmune disease in patients and controls. Cox regression was used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) for overall survival with 95\u00a0% confidence intervals (CIs). In patients with MM and a prior autoimmune disease, the risk of death was significantly increased, HR\u2009=\u20091.2 (95\u00a0% CI 1.2-1.3) compared to MM patients with no history of autoimmunity. In MGUS patients, a prior autoimmune disease was associated with a significantly 1.4-fold elevated risk of death (95\u00a0% CI 1.3-1.4). When analyzing different types of autoimmune diseases, a history of ulcerative colitis had a stronger impact on survival in MM than in controls. Our findings that a history of autoimmune disease has a negative impact on survival in MM and MGUS could be due to shared underlying common genetic factors, or that patients with a history of autoimmunity develop more severe cases of MM and MGUS, or cumulative comorbidity in the individual. Our results suggest that more attention should be paid to comorbidity as a prognostic factor in MGUS and MM, and underlines the need for studies aimed at tailoring therapy according to comorbidity.",

To effectively improve ornamental value, we require a better understanding of genetic architecture in the complex traits of the tree peony. Association mapping is a powerful tool for detection of variation associated with traits. Thus, we examined the genetic diversity and the population structure of 462 unrelated cultivated P. rockii individuals, then performed association mapping to identify simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers associated with 12 floral traits. We observed a moderate level of genetic diversity (PIC\u00a0=\u00a00.459) and low linkage disequilibrium (LD) between markers, demonstrating that the potential value of an LD approach in elucidating the molecular basis of the quantitative variation in this species. An analysis of population structure revealed three subgroups in the association population. Subsequent single-marker association analysis identified 46 significant associations, involving the 11 traits with 37 SSRs. These loci explained a small proportion of the phenotypic variance, ranging from 2.68 to 23.97% (mean 5.50%). We also validated 15 of the 46 associations in a linkage mapping population of 159 individuals. Finally, five associations were further confirmed in the linkage mapping population, involving the four traits with four SSRs. These results can serve as a foundation for further analyses of the genetic architecture of floral traits, and the SSRs associated in this work have potential applications in marker-assisted breeding in tree peony.",

The aim of this study was to systematically collect epidemiological information, investigate clinical features and create a clinical database of OI patients in Vietnam for future research and treatment strategy development.\nMETHOD: Participants underwent clinical and physical examinations; also medical records were reviewed. Genealogical information was collected and family members' phenotypical manifestations recorded. Cases were classified according to the Sillence classification.\nRESULTS: In total, 146 OI patients from 120 families were studied: 46 with OI Type I, 46 with Type III and 54 with Type IV. Almost patients had skeletal deformations. One hundred and forty-two had a history of fractures, 117 blue sclera, 89 dentinogenesis imperfecta and 26 hearing loss. The total number of fractures was 1,932. Thirty-four patients had intra-uterine fractures and nine had perinatal fractures. Surgery was performed 163 times in 58 patients; 100 osteosyntheses and 63 osteotomies. Bisphosphonate treatment was used in 37 patients. The number of affected individuals and predominance of severe forms of OI indicate that the disease is under diagnosed in Vietnam, especially in cases without a family history or with mild form of OI. Deformities appeared in all patients with different severity and localisation, affecting mostly the lower limbs. OI medical and surgical treatment rates are low and in most cases surgery was performed due to fractures.\nCONCLUSIONS: Compared to previous studies, our results indicate a lower OI prevalence and greater severity of symptoms in the Vietnamese population when compared with other areas.

In this case-control study (498 BC patients and 498 matched controls), three SNPs (rs8176318, rs12516 and rs15869) were selected in the 3'-UTR of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, which were within miRNA-binding seed regions and might have potential function to regulate the expression of BRCA1/BRCA2. Unconditional logistic regression model was used to analyze the association between three SNPs and BC risk with adjustment of reproductive factors, and Student's t test was performed to assess relative expression of BRCA2 in human breast cancer cell lines. Multifactor dimensionality reduction method was applied to calculate gene-reproductive factors interactions. A novel finding showed that AC [odds ratio (OR) 1.524; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.141-2.035] genotype of rs15869 in BRCA2 could increase the risk of BC and recombinant plasmid-pGenesil-1-miR-627 could negatively regulate the expression of BRCA2 in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Gene-reproductive factors interactions analysis revealed that rs15869 together with age at menarche and number of pregnancy could increase the risk of BC by 2.39-fold and TT genotype (OR 0.316; 95% CI 0.130-0.767) of rs8176318 had a significant association with progesterone receptor status in BC patients.

One-way analysis of variation was significant (P\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.001) for AUC<sub>0-180</sub> between the CC lines as well between both sexes. Despite Significant variations for both sexes, QTL analysis was significant, only for females, reporting a significant female-sex-dependent QTL (~2.5 Mbp) associated with IPGTT AUC<sub>0-180</sub> trait, located on Chromosome 8 (32-34.5 Mbp, containing 51 genes). Gene browse revealed QTL for body weight/size, genes involved in immune system, and two main protein-coding genes involved in the Glucose homeostasis, Mboat4 and Leprotl1. Heritability and coefficient of genetic variance (CVg) were 0.49 and 0.31 for females, while for males, these values 0.34 and 0.22, respectively. Our findings demonstrate the roles of genetic factors controlling glucose tolerance, which significantly differ between sexes requiring independent studies for females and males toward T2D prevention and therapy.",

        "abstract": "A long-standing paradigm in drug discovery has been the concept of designing maximally selective drugs to act on individual targets considered to underlie a disease of interest. Nonetheless, although some drugs have proven to be successful, many more potential drugs identified by the \"one gene, one drug, one disease\" approach have been found to be less effective than expected or to cause notable side effects. Advances in systems biology and high-throughput in-depth genomic profiling technologies along with an analysis of the successful and failed drugs uncovered that the prominent factor to determine drug sensitivity is the intrinsic robustness of the response of biological systems in the face of perturbations. The complexity of the molecular and cellular bases of systems responses to drug interventions has fostered an increased interest in systems-oriented approaches to drug discovery. Consonant with this knowledge of the multifactorial mechanistic basis of drug sensitivity and resistance is the application of network-based approaches for the identification of molecular (multi-)feature signatures associated with desired (multi-)drug phenotypic profiles. This chapter illustrates the principal network analysis and inference techniques which have found application in systems-oriented drug design and considers their benefits and drawbacks in relation to the nature of the data produced by network pharmacology.",

        "abstract": "Alternative splicing is widely recognized for playing roles in regulating genes and creating gene diversity. Consequently the identification and quantification of differentially spliced transcripts are pivotal for transcriptome analysis. However, how these diversified isoforms are spliced during genomic transcription and protein expression and what biological factors might influence the regulation of this are still required for further exploration. The advances in next-generation sequencing of messenger RNA (RNA-seq) have enabled us to survey gene expression and splicing more accurately. We have introduced a novel computational method, graph-based exon-skipping scanner (GESS), for de novo detection of skipping event sites from raw RNA-seq reads without prior knowledge of gene annotations, as well as for determining the dominant isoform generated from such sites. We have applied our method to publicly available RNA-seq data in GM12878 and K562 cells from the ENCODE consortium, and integrated other sequencing-based genomic data to investigate the impact of splicing activities, transcription factors (TFs) and epigenetic histone modifications on splicing outcomes. In a separate study, we also apply this algorithm in prostate cancer in The Cancer Genomics Atlas (TCGA) for de novo skipping event discovery to the understanding of abnormal splicing in each patient and to identify potential markers for prediction and progression of diseases.",

        "abstract": "The worrisome rise in pediatric type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is most prevalent among minority ethnic/racial populations. Typically, T2DM occurs during puberty in high risk obese adolescents with evidence of insulin resistance. Screening for T2DM in obese youth can be a daunting task for pediatricians and differentiating between pediatric T1DM and T2DM in obese youth can be challenging for pediatric endocrinologists. There is very limited data regarding the prevalence of T2DM among youth\u2009<\u200910\u2009years of age. Here we present the case of a 5-year-old Hispanic male diagnosed with T2DM after referral by his pediatrician for abnormal weight gain, acanthosis nigricans and an elevated HbgA1c. He subsequently became symptomatic for diabetes with confirmed hyperglycemia and HbgA1c of 9.7% (83\u2009mmol/mol) at the time of formal diagnosis. Type 1 diabetes autoantibodies (GAD65, Islet, and ZincT8) and monogenic diabetes genetic tests were negative. Due to elevated liver enzymes and baseline HbgA1c, he received basal insulin as his initial therapy. In this paper, we will discuss this case and present an IRB approved retrospective review of the characteristics of the 20 T2DM patients <10\u2009years of age identified to date in our pediatric diabetes center. This review highlights that while uncommon, the diagnosis of T2DM merits consideration even in prepubertal children. This is especially true when working with a high risk population, such as our Hispanic South Texas youth.",

Deep-sequencing of genomic regions indicative of efficient replication may be used to identify high-fitness minority individuals suppressed by the ensemble of mutants in a virus quasispecies. Molecular breeding of quasispecies containing colonizer individuals, under regimes allowing more than one replicative cycle, is a strategy to select the fittest competitors among the colonizers. A slow-growing cell culture-adapted hepatitis A virus strain was employed as a model for this strategy. Using genomic selection in two regions predictive of efficient translation, the internal ribosome entry site and the VP1-coding region, high-fitness minority colonizer individuals were identified in a population adapted to conditions of artificially-induced cellular transcription shut-off. Molecular breeding of this population with a second one, also adapted to transcription shut-off and showing an overall colonizer phenotype, allowed the selection of a fast-growing population of great biotechnological potential.",

Genetic evaluation of a composite breed is difficult because of the variation in the genetic composition of a given herd, as well as the inclusion of non-additive genetic effects among breeds that can be important for selecting traits in certain breed combinations. Newer models include additive and non-additive effects; however, few studies have investigated these aspects in tropical breeds. The aim of this study was to simulate genetic values to compare different models. Non-inclusion of maternal effects in models leads to overestimation of variance and direct heritability. Estimates of the biological additive effects are influenced by the maternal effects; however, estimates of the non-additive effects are minimally influenced by the maternal effects and are well estimated in any situation. The studied models effectively predict the direct genetic values.",

As a result, genetic improvement and selective-breeding program have been conducted for this species. Polymorphic microsatellites are effective molecular markers to investigate molecular marker-assisted selection and genetic variance. In this study, microsatellite DNAs were screened and characterized based on the partial genome sequence of P. fucata. We identified 111 microsatellite DNA motifs through mining the published draft genome sequence of P. fucata. Forty-two loci were screened with 8 P. fucata individuals, and 15 were found to be polymorphic and were therefore further evaluated using 40 wild individuals from the Daya Bay, Shenzhen City, Guangdong Province, China. The number of alleles per locus ranged from 3 to 8, with an average of 5.2667 for the 15 polymorphic loci. Observed and expected heterozygosities ranged from 0.1154 to 0.6216 (0.3321 on average) and 0.4950 to 0.8491 (0.6768 on average), respectively. Of the 15 polymorphic loci, 12 loci deviated from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium after Bonferroni correction (P < 0.0033).

To protect the genetic diversity of D. morifolium and enabling breeding of new D. morifolium cultivars, we developed a set of molecular markers. We used pyrosequencing of an enriched microsatellite library by Roche 454 FLX+ platform, to isolate D. morifolium simple sequence repeats (SSRs). A total of 32,863 raw reads containing 2251 SSRs were obtained. To test the effectiveness of these SSR markers, we designed primers by randomly selecting 100 novel SSRs, and amplified them across 60 cultivars representing five different petal shape groups. Sixteen SSRs were polymorphic with the number of alleles ranging from 6 to 19, and their expected and observed heterozygosities ranging from 0.477 to 0.848, and 0.250 to 0.804, respectively.

The data was submitted to analyses of variance followed by average Euclidean distance matrix estimation used as measure of dissimilarity. Subsequently, clusters were formed using the Tocher method and dendrograms were constructed using the hierarchical methods simple connection (nearest neighbor), complete connection (most distant neighbor), Ward, median, average within cluster connection. The nearest neighbor method presented the largest number of genotypes in group I and showed the greatest similarity with the Tocher optimization method.

The traditional estimator (TE) of experimental accuracy is not fully adequate. This study proposes and evaluates the performance and efficiency of two new accuracy estimators, called regularized estimator (RE) and hybrid estimator (HE), which were applied to a practical cassava breeding program and also to simulated data. The simulation study considered two individual narrow sense heritability levels and two genetic architectures for traits. TE, RE, and HE were compared under four validation procedures: without validation (WV), independent validation, ten-fold validation through jacknife allowing different markers, and with the same markers selected in each cycle. RE presented accuracies closer to the parametric ones and less biased and more precise ones than TE. HE proved to be very effective in the WV procedure. The estimators were applied to five traits evaluated in a cassava experiment, including 358 clones genotyped for 390 SNPs. Accuracies ranged from 0.67 to 1.12 with TE and from 0.22 to 0.51 with RE. These results indicated that TE overestimated the accuracy and led to one accuracy estimate (1.12) higher than one, which is outside of the parameter space. Use of RE turned the accuracy into the parameter space. Cassava breeding programs can be more realistically implemented using the new estimators proposed in this study, providing less risky practical inferences.",

Children with cancer have 80% chance of surviving in high-income countries compared to 20% in LMICs. Retinoblastoma (RB), an aggressive eye cancer of childhood and top childhood cancer in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), has a low survival rate, due to a delay in diagnosis and abandonment of treatment. The purpose of this study is to provide a tool for planning human resources required to manage RB in SSA.\nPROCEDURE: Online tool was developed with 19 modifiable fields and 23 estimates. Routine data were used to populate modifiable fields: population, birthrate, infant mortality rate, and total fertility rate. Values were held constant: frequency, 1:17,000; familial cases, 8%; unilateral RB, 74%; extraocular disease, 70%; and survival postextraocular treatment, 10%.\nRESULTS: One thousand twenty-three RB incident and familial cases are estimated each year across Ethiopia, Ghana, Malawi, Nigeria, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe: 75 familial, 700 unilateral, 717 extraocular disease, and 645 palliative. Nigeria represents 431 cases and Zimbabwe 33 cases. Over the eight countries, a total of 41,558 patient visits are estimated each year consisting of unilateral enucleation, follow-up visits, intensive treatment, and familial screening, with a total of 2,802 prosthetic eyes being required each year.\nCONCLUSIONS: In the absence of data, estimates are essential for planning countrywide medical services. More attention is needed around planning for services from the Ministry level including emphasis on building multidisciplinary teams for diseases such as RB, including countrywide database and integrated clinical practice guidelines among all levels of care.",

We investigated DC of the lacrimal gland for potentially clinically actionable targets in the search for new therapeutic options.\nMETHODS: Case 1: A 77-year-old man, presented with diplopia and xerophtalmia; case 2: A 53-year-old man, presented with headache, proptosis and chemosis and case 3: A 73-year-old man, presenting with chemosis and a corneal abscess. All three cases were characterized morphologically including immunohistochemistry and genetically with fluorescence in\u00a0situ hybridization (FISH) and one case with next-generation sequencing (NGS) of cancer relevant genes.\nRESULTS: Cases 1 and 3 were composed of large, rounded, irregular cystic nodules of carcinoma cells with prominent central comedonecrosis, whereas case 2 had a scirrhous morphology. High expression of CK7, CK19, EMA, p53 and HER2 was characteristic for all three tumours. Androgen receptor was intensely positive in case 1, in scattered cells in case 2 and negative in case 3, whereas oestrogen and progesterone receptor were consistently negative. Genetically, a hemizygous deletion and a point mutation in PTEN were identified in case 1, whereas HER2 amplification was found in cases 2 and 3.\nCONCLUSION: This study identified a spectrum of genetic events and pattern of protein expression in DC of the lacrimal gland similar to a subset of carcinomas of the breast and ductal carcinomas of the salivary glands. For therapeutic purposes, aberrations in several components of especially the HER2 signalling pathway could alleviate the effect of HER2-directed therapy illustrating an inadequacy of isolated HER2 testing.",

Rudd, Holtzworth-Munroe, Reyome, Applegate, and D'Onofrio (2015) conducted the only randomized controlled trial of any online parent program for separating parents, ProudToParent.org (PTP), and related court processes (e.g., having a waiting period between the establishment of paternity and the court hearing regarding child related issues vs. having the hearing the same day). They recruited a unique sample of 182 cases in a Title IV-D Court (i.e., a court for primarily low income parents) (Authorization of Appropriations, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 651, 2013), in which paternity was previously contested but subsequently established via court-ordered genetic testing. Unexpectedly, cases assigned to PTP and a waiting period were the least likely to reach agreement at their court hearing. In the current study, we extend these results to examine the impact of the study conditions on relitigation in the year following the court hearing; only 11.2% of cases filed a motion, and 7.8% had a hearing. The group that was least likely to reach full initial agreement (i.e., assigned to PTP and the waiting period) were the most likely to relitigate. Further, controlling for study conditions, reaching a full agreement in the Title IV-D court decreased the odds of having a court hearing in the following year. Reaching agreements on the specific issues involved in such cases (e.g., custody, child support) reduced the likelihood of both motions and hearings in the year after the Title IV-D hearings. The implications of these findings are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record",

Using liver metabolomics we have shown a starvation-like condition in a knock-in (Bcs1lc.232A&gt;G) mouse model of GRACILE syndrome, a neonatal lethal respiratory chain complex III dysfunction with hepatopathy. Here, we hypothesized that a high-carbohydrate diet (HCD, 60% dextrose) will alleviate the hypoglycemia and promote survival of the sick mice. However, when fed HCD the homozygotes had shorter survival (mean \u00b1 SD, 29 \u00b1 2.5 days, n = 21) than those on standard diet (33 \u00b1 3.8 days, n = 30), and no improvement in hypoglycemia or liver glycogen depletion. We investigated the plasma metabolome of the HCD- and control diet-fed mice and found that several amino acids and urea cycle intermediates were increased, and arginine, carnitines, succinate, and purine catabolites decreased in the homozygotes. Despite reduced survival the increase in aromatic amino acids, an indicator of liver mitochondrial dysfunction, was normalized on HCD. Quantitative enrichment analysis revealed that glycine, serine and threonine metabolism, phenylalanine and tyrosine metabolism, and urea cycle were also partly normalized on HCD. This dietary intervention revealed an unexpected adverse effect of high-glucose diet in complex III deficiency, and suggests that plasma metabolomics is a valuable tool in evaluation of therapies in mitochondrial disorders.",

However, most of the published techniques are not readily scalable to increase throughput. We recently described a CRISPR/Cas9-based high-throughput mutagenesis and phenotyping pipeline in zebrafish. Here, we present a complete workflow for this pipeline, including target selection; cloning-free single-guide RNA (sgRNA) synthesis; microinjection; validation of the target-specific activity of the sgRNAs; founder screening to identify germline-transmitting mutations by fluorescence PCR; determination of the exact lesion by Sanger or next-generation sequencing (including software for analysis); and genotyping in the F<sub>1</sub> or subsequent generations. Using these methods, sgRNAs can be evaluated in 3 d, zebrafish germline-transmitting mutations can be identified within 3 months and stable lines can be established within 6 months. Realistically, two researchers can target tens to hundreds of genes per year using this protocol.",

        "abstract": "The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/hepatitis B virus (HBV) co-infection is likely to be associated with an increased risk of kidney disease, due to the additional factors that may affect renal function in the HIV population. We aimed to evaluate renal toxicity in HIV/HBV and HBV mono-infected patients on long-term therapy with tenofovir (TDF) and to explore the association of polymorphisms in ATP-binding cassette (ABCC)2, ABCC4, ABCC10 with the development of renal dysfunction. From September 2006 to November 2014, 44 HIV/HBV co-infected and 34 HBV mono-infected patients were commenced on TDF. Data of renal safety were retrospectively collected and analyzed. ABCC2, ABCC4 and ABCC10 genotypes were identified by real-time PCR. Over 60\u00a0months of observation, there was a significant increase in mean creatinine levels from baseline (P&lt;.01) that was not significantly different between the two study groups. Moreover, a significant decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was observed from baseline (P&lt;.01), and it was significantly greater in HBV mono-infected than co-infected patients (P=.03). The distribution of ABCC2, ABCC4 and ABCC10 genotypes among a subgroup of 34 patients did not show significant association with eGFR decline &lt;90\u00a0mL/min per 1.73\u00a0m2 . Although our findings showed a statistically significant decrease in eGFR with long-term use of TDF, its clinical impact seems to be modest. The role of genetic factors to identify patients at greater risk for developing tenofovir-induced renal toxicity needs to be further investigated.",

        "abstract": "The current species extinction crisis is being exacerbated by an increased rate of emergence of epizootic disease. Human-induced factors including habitat degradation, loss of biodiversity and wildlife population reductions resulting in reduced genetic variation are accelerating disease emergence. Novel, efficient and effective approaches are required to combat these epizootic events. Here, we present the case for the application of human precision medicine approaches to wildlife medicine in order to enhance species conservation efforts. We consider how the precision medicine revolution, coupled with the advances made in genomics, may provide a powerful and feasible approach to identifying and treating wildlife diseases in a targeted, effective and streamlined manner. A number of case studies of threatened species are presented which demonstrate the applicability of precision medicine to wildlife conservation, including sea turtles, amphibians and Tasmanian devils. These examples show how species conservation could be improved by using precision medicine techniques to determine novel treatments and management strategies for the specific medical conditions hampering efforts to restore population levels. Additionally, a precision medicine approach to wildlife health has in turn the potential to provide deeper insights into human health and the possibility of stemming and alleviating the impacts of zoonotic diseases. The integration of the currently emerging Precision Medicine Initiative with the concepts of EcoHealth (aiming for sustainable health of people, animals and ecosystems through transdisciplinary action research) and One Health (recognizing the intimate connection of humans, animal and ecosystem health and addressing a wide range of risks at the animal-human-ecosystem interface through a coordinated, collaborative, interdisciplinary approach) has great potential to deliver a deeper and broader interdisciplinary-based understanding of both wildlife and human diseases.",

        "abstract": "CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: TUBB4A-related leukodystrophy comprises a phenotypic spectrum in which the MRI findings range from hypomyelination with atrophy of the basal ganglia and cerebellum (H-ABC) at the severe end to isolated hypomyelination at the mild end. Progressive neurologic findings reflect involvement of the pyramidal tracts (spasticity, brisk deep tendon reflexes, and Babinski sign), extrapyramidal system (rigidity, dystonia, choreoathetosis, oculogyric crisis, and perioral dyskinesia), cerebellum (ataxia, intention tremor, dysmetria), and bulbar function (dysarthria, dysphonia, and swallowing). Cognition is variably affected, usually less severely than motor function. Typically, those with H-ABC present in early childhood (ages 1-3 years) and those with isolated hypomyelination in later childhood or adulthood. The rate of progression varies with disease severity.\nDIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis is established in a proband with characteristic clinical and MRI findings and a heterozygous TUBB4A pathogenic variant identified by molecular genetic testing.\nMANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Functionally disabling spasticity requires medical management and physical therapy; dystonia requires medical management and \u2013 when refractory to medical management \u2013 possibly surgical intervention. Swallowing dysfunction may require use of a gastrostomy tube for feeding. Seizures, constipation, and gastroesophageal reflux disease are treated in the routine manner. Prevention of secondary complications: Calcium and vitamin D supplementation as required to prevent osteoporosis; attention to skin care and frequent repositioning to help prevent pressure sores in individuals with decreased mobility; annual flu vaccination; use of routine fall prevention strategies, adaptive equipment (e.g., wheelchairs and walkers), and physical therapy to help prevent secondary injury. Surveillance: Routine evaluations of (1) swallowing and feeding to reduce the risk of aspiration; (2) nutrition to prevent malnutrition; (3) orthopedic and joint integrity to detect joint dislocation and scoliosis. At least yearly: (1) medical evaluations to assess weight and medications; (2) evaluations by specialists in occupational therapy, physical therapy, speech therapy, rehabilitation medicine. Annual neurologic assessment to detect emerging complications.\nGENETIC COUNSELING: TUBB4A-related leukodystrophy is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Most affected individuals have the disorder as the result of a de novo pathogenic variant. The risk to sibs of a proband with clinically unaffected parents is low but greater than that of the general population because of the possibility of germline mosaicism or somatic and germline mosaicism in a parent. Individuals with TUBB4A-related leukodystrophy are not known to reproduce.",

In 2008 the AAP issued an updated clinical report detailing recommendations for screening and evaluation of cholesterol levels in children and adolescents as well as prevention and treatment strategies. Since the publication of the first guidelines, rates of pediatric obesity have significantly increased, resulting in a concomitant increase in dyslipidemia. Recently, options for pharmacotherapeutic interventions in pediatric patients have expanded with new FDA approved indications of several lipid lowering medications, as well as additional safety and efficacy data. In 2011, The National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) published its comprehensive report Integrated Guidelines for Cardiovascular Health and Risk Reduction in Children and Adolescents. As with previous guidelines, lifestyle modifications with an emphasis on a heart-healthy diet and daily moderate to vigorous exercise remain an integral part of treatment for pediatric lipid disorders; however, the recommendations for patients requiring management with pharmacotherapy have changed, and will be the focus of this discussion.

        "abstract": "None: Cholesterol is critical during the development of embryos, fetuses and neonates to support their growth and development. Cholesterol is a structural component of membranes in every cell, it is involved with numerous signaling events, and it is the precursor for key steroid hormones. All individuals, either in utero or post-partum, have two sources of cholesterol, endogenous and exogenous. In the embryo and fetus, endogenous cholesterol comes from de novo synthesis and exogenous sources originate in the maternal circulation; maternal cholesterol-carrying lipoproteins are taken up from the maternal circulation by the placenta or yolk sac, processed, and transported across cells to the embryo or fetus. In the neonate, endogenous cholesterol is also synthesized de novo whereas exogenous cholesterol is derived from the diet. Changes in maternal metabolism (diabetes or obesity) or adverse pregnancy outcomes (preterm births or preeclampsia) could lead to altered fetal sterol metabolism. In this review, we will examine fetal and neonatal cholesterol metabolism in complicated and uncomplicated pregnancies. Early identification of neonatal cholesterol abnormalities could identify infants in need of immediate treatments, mostly due to genetic disorders, and infants that could be at long-term risk of metabolic diseases.

        "abstract": "None: Pediatric primary or monogenic dyslipidemias are a heterogeneous group of disorders, characterized by severe elevation of cholesterol, triglycerides, or rarely a combination of the two. Monogenic hypercholesterolemias have elevated low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels and very high risk of premature atherosclerotic disease. They are caused by mutations in genes involved in the receptor-mediated uptake of LDL by the LDL receptor (LDLR) in hepatocytes. Autosomal dominant familial hypercholesterolemia results from mutations in LDLR, apolipoprotein B-100 (APOB), or proprotein convertase subtilisin-like kexin type 9 (PCSK9). Autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia is caused by mutations in the LDLR adaptor protein 1 (LDLRAP1) gene. Type 1 hyperlipoproteinemia (Familial Chylomicronemia Syndrome) have severe fasting hypertriglyceridemia secondary to accumulation of triglyceride (TG)-rich lipoproteins, especially chylomicrons. It results from mutations in one or more genes that compromise chylomicron lipolysis and clearance. It has autosomal recessive inheritance caused by mutations in lipoprotein lipase (LPL), Apolipoprotein C-II(APOCII), Lipase maturation factor 1(LMF-1), Apolipoprotein A-V(APOAV), Glycosylphosphatidylinositolanchored high-density lipoprotein-binding protein 1(GPIHBP1). Familial combined hypercholesterolemia is a complex genetic disease and primarily a disorder of adults. There is strong evidence demonstrating a log-linear relationship between total cholesterol levels and coronary heart disease risk. Severe hypertriglyceridemia has an increased risk of acute pancreatitis. Universal lipid screening with measurement of non-fasting non-HDL cholesterol should be performed in all children ages 9 \u201311 years and 17\u201321 years.

        "abstract": "Gastric cancer is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates worldwide. Identifying individuals at high risk is important for surveillance and prevention of gastric cancer. Having first-degree relatives diagnosed with gastric cancer is a strong and consistent risk factor for gastric cancer, but the pathogenic mechanisms behind this familial aggregation are unclear. Against this background, we reviewed the risk factors for gastric cancer in those with a first-degree relative with gastric cancer, and the possible causes for familial clustering of gastric cancer including bacterial factors, inherited genetic susceptibility, environmental factors or a combination thereof. Among individuals with a family history, current or past Helicobacter pylori infection, having two or more first-degree affected relatives or female gender was associated with an increased risk of developing gastric cancer. To date, no specific single nucleotide polymorphism has been shown to be associated with familial clustering of gastric cancer. H. pylori eradication is the most important strategy for preventing gastric cancer in first-degree relatives of gastric cancer patients, particularly those in their 20s and 30s. Early H. pylori eradication could prevent the progression to intestinal metaplasia and reduce the synergistic effect on gastric carcinogenesis in individuals with both H. pylori infection and a family history. Endoscopic surveillance is also expected to benefit individuals with a family history. Further large-scale, prospective studies are warranted to evaluate the cost-effectiveness and optimal time point for endoscopy in this population. Moreover, genome-wide association studies that incorporate environmental and dietary factors on a 'big data' basis will increase our understanding of the pathogenesis of gastric cancer.",

Despite aggressive treatment with surgery, radiation and chemotherapy, these tumors are incurable and invariably recur. Molecular characterization of these tumors in recent years has advanced our understanding of gliomagenesis and offered an array of pathways that can be specifically targeted. Areas covered: The most commonly dysregulated signaling pathways found in gliomas will be discussed, as well as the biologic importance of these disrupted pathways and how each may contribute to tumor development. Our knowledge regarding these pathways are most relevant to Grade IV glioma/glioblastoma, but we will also discuss genomic categorization of low grade glioma. Further, drugs targeting single pathways, which have undergone early phase clinical trials will be reviewed, followed by an in depth discussion of emerging treatments on the horizon, which will include inhibitors of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) and receptor tyrosine kinases, Phosphoinositide-3-Kinase (PI3K), angiogenesis, cell cycle and mutant Isocitrate Dehydrogenase (IDH) mutations. Expert opinion: Results from single agent targeted therapy trials have been modest. Lack of efficacy may stem from a combination of poor blood brain barrier penetration, the genetically heterogeneous make-up of the tumors and the emergence of resistance mechanisms. These factors can be overcome by rational drug design that capitalizes on ways to target critical pathways and limits upregulation of redundant pathways.",

Serum thyroid hormone levels were determined using ELISA.\nRESULTS: Our study showed higher TSH and FT4 levels and lower FT3 levels in women with preeclampsia compared to normal pregnant women, with statistical significance for women with mild and severe preeclampsia. The risk to develop pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH), mild or severe preeclampsia was increased in carriers of at least one D2-Ala92 allele. TSH and FT4 levels were significantly higher and FT3 levels were significantly lower in preeclamptic women with severe preeclampsia if they carried the D2-Ala92 allele compared to non-carriers. Pregnant women with PIH and mild preeclampsia, carriers of at least one D2-Ala92 allele, delivered at lower gestational age neonates with a lower birth weight compared to non-carriers, but the results were statistically significant only in severe preeclampsia.\nCONCLUSION: The D2-Thr92Ala genetic variant is associated with the severity and the obstetric outcome of preeclampsia, and it also influences thyroid hormone levels.

The present study was conducted to explore the value of NRBC count in prognosis of asphyxiated neonates.\nMETHODS: Sixty-three neonates with asphyxia were followed up for two years. Maternal and neonatal information was recorded follow by clinical and laboratory evaluation. NRBC-level was determined per 100 white-blood-cells (WBC). After discharge, follow-up of asphyxiated infants was performed using Denver II test at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months. Neonates were divided into two groups, with favorable and unfavorable outcome based on developmental delay or death.\nRESULTS: We observed that NRBC count with more than 11 per 100 WBC, had sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 90% in predicting complications of asphyxia, while in absolute NRBC count with more than 1554, the sensitivity and specificity were 85% and of 87%, respectively. Combination of NRBC\u2009+\u2009HIE (hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy) grade had a high-predictive power for determining the prognosis of asphyxia in neonates.\nCONCLUSION: We demonstrate that NRBC/100 WBC and absolute NRCB count can be used as prognostic marker for neonatal asphyxia, which in combination with the severity of asphyxia could indicate high infant mortality, and complications of asphyxia.

Although mass spectrometry has become the state-of-the-art method for quantifying steroids, there are few comprehensive age-, sex-, and pubertal stage-specific reference ranges for children.\nAIMS: To develop a sensitive and reliable ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) method for simultaneous quantification of DHEAS and 17OHPreg and to establish entire age-, sex- and pubertal stage-specific reference ranges in children.\nMETHODS: A total of 684 children, 453 (243 female, 210 male) with normal body mass index (BMI; <90th) and 231 (132 female, 99 male) obese subjects (>97th), were categorized into 11 age groups, and age- and Tanner stage (PH)-specific reference ranges were determined.\nRESULTS: The limit of detection was 0.05 nmol/L for 17OHPreg and 0.5 nmol/L for DHEAS. Levels of both steroids declined after the neonatal period. Comparisons with RIA assays (Siemens, Munich, Germany) (DHEAS) and an in-house kit (17OHPreg) revealed 0.95 and 0.93, respectively, as coefficients of determination. Although DHEAS-generally higher in boys-increased continuously starting at 3 to 6 years, 17OHPreg remained largely constant. In obese patients, both were significantly elevated, also in part after alignment to Tanner stages (PH).\nCONCLUSIONS: UPLC-MS/MS is sensitive and reliable for quantifying DHEAS and 17OHPreg. Our data support differential maturation of CYP17 during adrenarche with successively increasing 17,20-lyase activity but largely constant 17\u03b1-hydroxylation activity.

Although ideally a TE graft would contain urethral epithelium cells, currently, bladder epithelium (urothelium) is widely used, but morphologically different. Understanding the differences and similarities of urothelium and urethral epithelium could help design a protocol for in vitro generation of urethral epithelium to be used in TE grafts for the urethra.\nPURPOSE: To understand the development toward urethral epithelium or urothelium to improve TE of the urethra.\nMETHODS: A literature search was done following PRISMA guidelines. Articles describing urethral epithelium and bladder urothelium development in laboratory animals and humans were selected.\nRESULTS: Twenty-nine studies on development of urethral epithelium and 29 studies on development of urothelium were included. Both tissue linings derive from endoderm and although adult urothelium and urethral epithelium are characterized by different gene expression profiles, the signaling pathways underlying their development are similar, including Shh, BMP, Wnt, and FGF. The progenitor of the urothelium and the urethral epithelium is the early fetal urogenital sinus (UGS). The urethral plate and the urothelium are both formed from the p63+ cells of the UGS. Keratin 20 and uroplakins are exclusively expressed in urothelium, not in the urethral epithelium. Further research has to be done on unique markers for the urethral epithelium.\nCONCLUSION: This review has summarized the current knowledge about embryonic development of urothelium versus urethral epithelium and especially focuses on the influencing factors that are potentially specific for the eventual morphological differences of both cell linings, to be a basis for developmental or tissue engineering of urethral tissue.",

However, the location of the causative mutations is not known, and the presence of many variants that are in low LD with the causative mutations may reduce prediction reliability. Our objective was to investigate whether the use of variants at quantitative trait loci (QTL) that are identified in a multi-breed genome-wide association study (GWAS) for milk, fat and protein yield would increase the reliability of within- and multi-breed genomic predictions in Holstein, Jersey and Danish Red cattle. A wide range of scenarios that test different strategies to select prediction markers, for both within-breed and multi-breed prediction, were compared.\nRESULTS: For all breeds and traits, the use of variants selected from a multi-breed GWAS resulted in substantial increases in prediction reliabilities compared to within-breed prediction using a 50\u00a0K SNP array. Reliabilities depended highly on the choice of the prediction markers, and the scenario that led to the highest reliability varied between breeds and traits. While genomic correlations across breeds were low for genome-wide sequence variants, the effects of the QTL variants that yielded the highest reliabilities were highly correlated across breeds.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our results show that the use of sequence variants, which are located near peaks of QTL that are detected in a multi-breed GWAS, can increase reliability of genomic predictions.",

However, little is known about the mechanisms through which neonatal iron deficiency results in long lasting alterations in hippocampal gene expression and function. DNA methylation is an epigenetic mark involved in gene regulation and altered by environmental factors. In this study, hippocampal DNA methylation and gene expression were assessed via reduced representation bisulfite sequencing and RNA-seq on samples from a previous study reporting reduced hippocampal-based learning and memory in a porcine biomedical model of neonatal iron deficiency.\nRESULTS: In total 192 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between the iron deficient and control groups. GO term and pathway enrichment analysis identified DEGs associated with hypoxia, angiogenesis, increased blood brain barrier (BBB) permeability, and altered neurodevelopment and function. Of particular interest are genes previously implicated in cognitive deficits and behavioral disorders in humans and mice, including HTR2A, HTR2C, PAK3, PRSS12, and NETO1. Altered genome-wide DNA methylation was observed across 0.5 million CpG and 2.4 million non-CpG sites. In total 853 differentially methylated (DM) CpG and 99 DM non-CpG sites were identified between groups. Samples clustered by group when comparing DM non-CpG sites, suggesting high conservation of non-CpG methylation in response to neonatal environment. In total 12 DM sites were associated with 9 DEGs, including genes involved in angiogenesis, neurodevelopment, and neuronal function.\nCONCLUSIONS: Neonatal iron deficiency leads to altered hippocampal DNA methylation and gene regulation involved in hypoxia, angiogenesis, increased BBB permeability, and altered neurodevelopment and function.

Two family members who carried the BMPR2 mutation only did not develop manifest HPAH.\nCONCLUSIONS: This is the first study suggesting that EIF2AK4 can also contribute to autosomal dominantly inherited HPAH. Up to now it has only been identified in a recessive form of HPAH. Only those family members with a co-occurrence of two mutations developed manifest HPAH. Thus, the EIF2AK4 and BMRPR2 mutations support the \"second hit\" hypothesis explaining the variable penetrance of HPAH in this family. Hence, the assessment of all known PAH genes in families with a known mutation might assist in predictions about the clinical manifestation in so far non-affected mutation carriers.",

        "title": "Identification of microRNAs regulating Escherichia coli F18 infection in Meishan weaned piglets.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Escherichia coli F18 is mainly responsible for post-weaning diarrhea (PWD) in piglets. The molecular regulation of E. coli F18 resistance in Chinese domestic weaned piglets is still obscure. We used Meishan piglets as model animals to test their susceptibility to E. coli F18. Small RNA duodenal libraries were constructed for E. coli F18-sensitive and -resistant weaned piglets challenged with E. coli F18 and sequenced using Illumina Solexa high-throughput sequencing technology.\nRESULTS: Sequencing results showed that 3,475,231 and 37,198,259 clean reads were obtained, with 311 known miRNAs differently expressed in resistant and sensitive groups, respectively. Twenty-four miRNAs, including 15 up-regulated and 9 down-regulated, demonstrated more than a 2-fold differential expression between the F18-resistant and -sensitive piglets. Stem-loop RT-qPCR showed that miR-136, miR-196b, miR-499-5p and miR-218-3p significantly expressed in intestinal tissue (p\u2009<\u20090.05). KEGG pathway analysis for target genes revealed that differently expressed miRNAs were involved in infectious diseases, signal transduction and immune system pathways. Interestingly, the expression of miR-218-3p in intestinal tissue had a very significant negative correlation with target DLG5 (P\u2009<\u20090.01).\nCONCLUSIONS: Based on the expression correlation between miRNA and target genes analysis, we speculate that miR-218-3p targeting to DLG5, appears to be very promising candidate for miRNAs involved in response to E. coli F18 infection. The present study provides improved database information on pig miRNAs, better understanding of the genetic basis of E. coli F18 resistance in local Chinese pig breeds and lays a new foundation for identifying novel markers of E. coli F18 resistance.\nREVIEWERS: This article was reviewed by Neil R Smalheiser and Weixiong Zhang.",

        "abstract": "A cohort comprising 156 patients with B-cell neoplasms harboring an MYC rearrangement was analyzed with respect to phenotypic presentation, molecular markers (TP53, MYC and ID3) and additional cytogenetic abnormalities (concomitantly occurring BCL2, BCL6 and/or CCND1 rearrangements; double, triple or quadruple hit lymphomas\u2009=\u2009multiple hit lymphomas). MYC translocations occurred as single hit (only MYC rearranged, 63%) or multiple hit lymphoma (37%) and presented as acute leukemia (AL) (14%), Burkitt lymphoma (30%), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) (21%) or other mature B-cell neoplasms (35%). Multiple hit lymphomas more frequently showed a complex karyotype compared to single hit lymphomas (62% vs. 28%, p\u2009<\u20090.001). Single hit Burkitt lymphomas presented with specific characteristics, by translocation of MYC to an immunoglobulin locus, predominantly a non-complex karyotype (23% vs. 67%, p\u2009=\u20090.012) and a significantly higher ID3 and TP53 mutation frequency (ID3mut: 49% vs. 0%, p\u2009=\u20090.002; TP53mut: 69% vs. 33%, p\u2009=\u20090.045). Additionally, MYC rearranged CLL presented as outstanding group by often showing a non-complex karyotype (85%), absence of ID3 mutations, a high frequency of SF3B1 mutations, and a frequent involvement of non-immunoglobulin loci as MYC-partner genes (61%). Consequently, genetic characteristics distinguish different subgroups of MYC rearranged B-cell neoplasms and therefore may contribute to a new classification system.",

        "abstract": "Pilocytic astrocytoma (PA) is one of the most common brain cancers among children and activation of the Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) pathway is considered the hallmark. In the majority of cases, oncogenic BRAF fusions or BRAF V600E mutations are observed, while RAF1 or NF1 alterations are more rarely found. However, in some cases, no apparent cancer driver events can be identified. Here, we describe a novel fusion between the transcription factor nuclear factor 1A (NFIA) and Raf-1 proto-oncogene (RAF1) in a 5-year old boy with PA. The novel fusion was identified as part of a comprehensive genomic tumor profiling. We show that the NFIA:RAF1 fusion results in constitutive Raf1 kinase activity, leading to activation of downstream MEK1/2 cascade and increased proliferation of cancer cells. The NFIA:RAF1 fusion displayed distinct subcellular localization towards the plasma membrane indicative of Raf-1 activation, in contrast to both wild type NFIA and Raf-1, which were localized in the nucleus and cytoplasm, respectively. In conclusion, our data support the existence of rare oncogenic RAF1 fusions with constitutive Raf-1 activity. This highlights the need for broad genetic testing in order to refine diagnostics of PA and to unravel potential treatment options, e.g. with MEK inhibitors.",

        "abstract": "Hypoglycaemia has traditionally been associated with neonatal diarrhoea and endotoxaemia in calves, but the clinical relevance of this finding in spontaneously diseased calves has not previously been evaluated. To determine the prevalence and prognostic relevance of severe hypoglycaemia (plasma glucose concentration < 2\u2009mmol/L), data from 10,060 hospitalised calves (\u226421 days of age) were retrospectively analysed. Additionally, clinical findings and diagnoses in a subset of 100 calves with severe hypoglycaemia were compared with those in 100 randomly selected calves with initial plasma glucose concentrations in the reference range (4.4-6.9\u2009mmol/L). The prevalence of severe hypoglycaemia in the whole study sample was 6.3%. Severe hypoglycaemia was associated with a poor survival rate of 20.6% vs. 74.0% discharged animals in the group of calves with initial normoglycaemia. Review of medical records revealed that severe hypoglycaemia was significantly associated with clinical or necropsy evidence of septicaemia, hypothermia, history or clinical evidence of malnutrition, and peritonitis of varied origin, but not with the presence of neonatal diarrhoea. Only 10 of 100 calves with severe hypoglycaemia showed central nervous involvement such as seizures and opisthotonus. In conclusion, severe hypoglycaemia has a low prevalence in diseased calves in a hospital setting, but is associated with serious health problems and therefore a high risk of non-survival. Severe hypoglycaemia was not easily diagnosed based on clinical signs, but should be suspected in calves with clinical evidence of septicaemia, hypothermia, acute abdominal emergencies, and a history or clinical evidence of malnutrition.",

        "abstract": "Colorectal (CRCs) and endometrioid (EMCs) cancers in patients with Lynch syndrome exhibit microsatellite instability (MSI) detected by PCR or immunohistochemistry (IHC). While both assays are equally sensitive for CRCs, some suggest that PCR has a higher false-negative rate than IHC in EMCs. We assessed the MSI profiles of 91 EMC and 311 CRC specimens using five mononucleotide repeat markers: BAT25, BAT26, NR21, NR24, and MONO27. EMCs with high MSI (MSI-H) showed a mean left shift of 3 nucleotides (nt), which was significantly different from 6 nt in CRCs. A shift of 1 nt was observed in multiple markers in 76% of MSI-H EMCs, whereas only 12% of MSI-H CRCs displayed a 1-nt shift in one of five markers. IHC against four mismatch repair proteins was performed in 78 EMCs. Loss of staining in one or more proteins was detected in 18 of 19 tumors that were MSI-H by PCR. When EMC tumor cell burden was diluted to <30%, MSI-H was no longer observed in two of three EMCs with a mean nucleotide shift of 1 nt. These results indicate that EMC and CRC MSI profiles are different and that caution should be exercised when interpreting the results, as subtle, 1-nt changes may be missed. These findings provide a potential cause of previously reported discordant MSI and IHC results in EMCs.",

        "abstract": "Previously we reported that cysteinyl leukotrienes (Cys-LTs) and the type 1 receptor for Cys-LTs (CysLT<sub>1</sub>R) are related to amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2)-induced neurotoxicity. The aim of the current study was to find out the role of CysLT<sub>1</sub>R on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced cognitive deficit and neurotoxicity. shRNA-mediated knockdown or pharmacological blockade (by pranlukast) of CysLT<sub>1</sub>R were performed in ICR mice for 21days prior to systemic infusion of LPS. From day 22, LPS was administered for 7days and then a set of behavioral, histopathological and biochemical tests were employed to test memory, neuroinflammation and apoptotic responses in the mouse hippocampus. LPS (only)-treated mice showed poor performance in both Morris water maze (MWM) and Y-maze tests. However, shRNA-mediated knockdown or pranlukast-treated blockade of CysLT<sub>1</sub>R improved performance of the mice in these tests. To find out the possible underlying mechanisms, we assessed several parameters such as microglial activation (by immunohistochemistry), level of CysLT<sub>1</sub>R (by WB and qRT-PCR) and the inflammatory/apoptotic pathways (by ELISA or TUNEL or WB) in the mouse hippocampus. LPS-induced memory impairment was accompanied by activation of microglia, higher level of CysLT<sub>1</sub>R, IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1 and nuclear NF-\u03baB p65. LPS also caused apoptosis in the hippocampus as detected by TUNEL staining, further supplemented by detection of increased Caspase-3 and a reduced Bcl-2/Bax ratio. All of these adverse changes in the mouse hippocampus were inhibited by pretreatment with CysLT<sub>1</sub>R-shRNA and pranlukast. Through this study we suggest that CysLT<sub>1</sub>R shares a strong correlation with LPS-associated memory deficit, neuroinflammation and apoptosis and CysLT<sub>1</sub>R could be a novel target for preventive measures to intervene the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like phenotypes.",

Birth weights of infants born before 32\u00a0weeks' gestation were recorded on the WINROP online database system weekly until postmenstrual week 36. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of the WINROP algorithm were analyzed.\nRESULTS: A total of 223 infants were included. WINROP yielded a low-risk result in 106 infants (48%) and a high-risk result (red alarm) in the remaining 117 infants (53%). The sensitivity of the WINROP online system was found to be 84.3% (27/32), whereas its specificity was found to be 52.8% (101/191). The time between the first alarm and treatment was 8.59\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.92 (2-15) weeks.

        "abstract": "Drug-resistance testing, or antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST), is mandatory for Mycobacterium tuberculosis in cases of failure on standard therapy. We reviewed the different methods and techniques of phenotypic and genotypic approaches. Although multiresistant and extensively drug-resistant (MDR/XDR) tuberculosis is present worldwide, AST for M.\u00a0tuberculosis (AST-MTB) is still mainly performed according to the resources available rather than the drug-resistance rates. Phenotypic methods, i.e. culture-based AST, are commonly used in high-income countries to confirm susceptibility of new cases of tuberculosis. They are also used to detect resistance in tuberculosis cases with risk factors, in combination with genotypic tests. In low-income countries, genotypic methods screening hot-spot mutations known to confer resistance were found to be easier to perform because they avoid the culture and biosafety constraint. Given that genotypic tests can rapidly detect the prominent mechanisms of resistance, such as the rpoB mutation for rifampicin resistance, we are facing new challenges with the observation of false-resistance (mutations not conferring resistance) and false-susceptibility (mutations different from the common mechanism) results. Phenotypic and genotypic approaches are therefore complementary for obtaining a high sensitivity and specificity for detecting drug resistances and susceptibilities to accurately predict MDR/XDR cure and to gather relevant data for resistance surveillance. Although AST-MTB was established in the 1960s, there is no consensus reference method for MIC determination against which the numerous AST-MTB techniques can be compared. This information is necessary for assessing in\u00a0vitro activity and setting breakpoints for future anti-tuberculosis agents.",

To this end, we compared the storage, indexing, and query efficiency of a common relational database (MySQL), a document-oriented NoSQL database (MongoDB), and a relational database with NoSQL support (PostgreSQL).

However, associations of pancreatic cancer with other familial cancers are less clear. We analyzed data from the Queensland Pancreatic Cancer Study (QPCS), an Australian population-based case-control study, to investigate associations between family history of various cancer types and risk of pancreatic cancer.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Our study included 591 pancreatic cancer patients and 646 controls, all of whom self-reported the histories of cancer in their first-degree relatives. We used logistic regression to estimate adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Based on our results, we conducted a systematic literature review using the Medline (OVID) database to identify articles pertaining to the association between family history of melanoma and risk of pancreatic cancer. A meta-analysis including associations in five published studies, unpublished results from a study co-author and the QPCS results was then performed using the DerSimonian and Laird random-effects model.\nRESULTS: Cases were more likely than controls to report a family history of pancreatic cancer (OR 2.20, 95% CI 1.16-4.19) and melanoma (OR 1.74, 95% CI 1.03-2.95), but not of breast, ovarian, respiratory, other gastrointestinal or prostate cancer. Meta-analysis of melanoma family history and pancreatic cancer risk yielded an OR of 1.22 (95% CI 1.00-1.51).\nCONCLUSIONS: Our results yield further evidence of increased risk of pancreatic cancer in those with family histories of the disease.

        "abstract": "UNLABELLED: HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) affects approximately half of HIV-infected patients. Infected non-neuronal cells release neurotoxic factors such as the viral protein transactivator of transcription (Tat) that potentiate NMDAR function. NMDARs regulate synaptic changes observed after exposure to HIV proteins, which may underlie cognitive impairment in HAND patients. Here, we used patch-clamp recording to measure NMDAR-mediated currents in rat hippocampal cultures after exposure to Tat. Tat (4-16 h) potentiated NMDA-evoked whole-cell current and increased the NMDAR:AMPAR ratio of evoked EPSCs. Potentiated currents adapted back to baseline amplitudes after 24 h of exposure to Tat. Pharmacological inhibition of GluN2A-containing NMDARs prevented adaptation, but inhibition of GluN2B-containing NMDARs did not. Pharmacological and genetic approaches determined that potentiated NMDARs activated the kinase Akt, which then activated the E3 ubiquitin ligase Mdm2. Inhibition of protein synthesis prevented adaptation, suggesting that Mdm2 altered gene expression, possibly through its well known target p53. Expression of GFP-tagged GluN1 subunits resulted in fluorescent puncta that colocalized with synaptic markers. Tat (24 h) caused an Mdm2-dependent loss of NMDAR puncta on a timescale similar to adaption of NMDAR function. Activation of the Mdm2 pathway degrades PSD-95, a scaffolding protein that clusters NMDARs at the synapse and enhances their function. Adaptation to the continued presence of excitotoxins that potentiate NMDARs such as HIV Tat may protect from excessive NMDAR activation while also contributing to the synaptic loss that correlates with cognitive decline in HAND.\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Synaptodendritic damage correlates with cognitive decline in HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND). In a cell culture model, we show that the HIV protein transactivator of transcription (Tat) initially potentiates NMDARs that then adapt to the presence of the toxin. Adaptation of NMDAR function was mediated by a GluN2A/Akt/Mdm2 pathway not previously linked to neuroinflammatory disorders such as HAND. Activation of this pathway caused a loss of synaptic NMDAR clusters. Decreased NMDAR function may result from a homeostatic response gone awry and underlie impaired synaptic function in HAND.",

        "abstract": "UNLABELLED: PPAR\u03b3 is one of the three isoforms of the Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors (PPARs). PPAR\u03b3 is activated by thiazolidinediones such as pioglitazone and is targeted to treat insulin resistance. PPAR\u03b3 is densely expressed in brain areas involved in regulation of motivational and emotional processes. Here, we investigated the role of PPAR\u03b3 in the brain and explored its role in anxiety and stress responses in mice. The results show that stimulation of PPAR\u03b3 by pioglitazone did not affect basal anxiety, but fully prevented the anxiogenic effect of acute stress. Using mice with genetic ablation of neuronal PPAR\u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3NestinCre), we demonstrated that a lack of receptors, specifically in neurons, exacerbated basal anxiety and enhanced stress sensitivity. The administration of GW9662, a selective PPAR\u03b3 antagonist, elicited a marked anxiogenic response in PPAR\u03b3 wild-type (WT), but not in PPAR\u03b3NestinCre knock-out (KO) mice. Using c-Fos immunohistochemistry, we observed that acute stress exposure resulted in a different pattern of neuronal activation in the amygdala (AMY) and the hippocampus (HIPP) of PPAR\u03b3NestinCre KO mice compared with WT mice. No differences were found between WT and KO mice in hypothalamic regions responsible for hormonal response to stress or in blood corticosterone levels. Microinjection of pioglitazone into the AMY, but not into the HIPP, abolished the anxiogenic response elicited by acute stress. Results also showed that, in both regions, PPAR\u03b3 colocalizes with GABAergic cells. These findings demonstrate that neuronal PPAR\u03b3 is involved the regulation of the stress response and that the AMY is a key substrate for the anxiolytic effect of PPAR\u03b3.\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Gamma (PPAR\u03b3) is a classical target for antidiabetic therapies with thiazolidinedione compounds. PPAR\u03b3 agonists such as rosiglitazone and pioglitazone are in clinical use for the treatment of insulin resistance. PPAR\u03b3 has recently attracted attention for its involvement in the regulation of CNS immune response and functions. Here, we demonstrate that neuronal PPAR\u03b3 activation prevented the negative emotional effects of stress and exerted anxiolytic actions without influencing hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function. Conversely, pharmacological blockade or genetic deletion of PPAR\u03b3 enhanced anxiogenic responses and increased vulnerability to stress.

To understand the physiological function of CPEB2, we generated CPEB2 knock-out (KO) mice and found that most died within 3 d after birth. CPEB2 is highly expressed in the brainstem, which controls vital functions, such as breathing. Whole-body plethysmography revealed that KO neonates had aberrant respiration with frequent apnea. Nevertheless, the morphology and function of the respiratory rhythm generator and diaphragm neuromuscular junctions appeared normal. We found that upregulated translation of choline acetyltransferase in the CPEB2 KO dorsal motor nucleus of vagus resulted in hyperactivation of parasympathetic signaling-induced bronchoconstriction, as evidenced by increased pulmonary acetylcholine and phosphorylated myosin light chain 2 in bronchial smooth muscles. Specific deletion of CPEB2 in cholinergic neurons sufficiently caused increased apnea in neonatal pups and airway hyper-reactivity in adult mice. Moreover, inhalation of an anticholinergic bronchodilator reduced apnea episodes in global and cholinergic CPEB2-KO mice. Together, the elevated airway constriction induced by cholinergic transmission in KO neonates may account for the respiratory defect and mortality.\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: This study first generated and characterized cpeb2 gene-deficient mice. CPEB2-knock-out (KO) mice are born alive but most die within 3 d after birth showing no overt defects in anatomy. We found that the KO neonates showed severe apnea and altered respiratory pattern. Such respiratory defects could be recapitulated in mice with pan-neuron-specific or cholinergic neuron-specific ablation of the cpeb2 gene. Further investigation revealed that cholinergic transmission in the KO dorsal motor nucleus of vagus was overactivated because KO mice lack CPEB2-suppressed translation of the rate-limiting enzyme in the production of acetylcholine (i.e., choline acetyltransferase). Consequently, increased parasympathetic signaling leads to hyperactivated bronchoconstriction and abnormal respiration in the KO neonates.",

        "abstract": "The impact of omeprazole (OM), a widely used over-the-counter proton pump inhibitor, on weight gain has not been extensively explored. We examined what factors, e.g., diet composition, microbiota, genetic strain, and sex, might affect weight gain in mice fed a high caloric diet while on OM. Inbred C57BL/6J strain, a 50:50 hybrid (B6SJLF1/J) strain, and mice on a highly mixed genetic background were fed four diets: standard chow (STD, 6% fat), STD with 200 ppm OM (STD + O), a high-energy chow (HiE, 11% fat), and HiE chow with OM (HiE + O) for 17 wk. Metabolic analysis, body composition, and fecal microbiota composition were analyzed in C57BL/6J mice. Oral glucose tolerance tests were performed using mice on the mixed background. After 8 wk, female and male C57BL/6J mice on the HiE diets ate less, whereas males on the HiE diets compared with the STD diets gained weight. All diet treatments reduced energy expenditure in females but in males only those on the HiE + O diet. Gut microbiota composition differed in the C57BL/6J females but not the males. Hybrid B6SJLF1/J mice showed similar weight gain on all test diets. In contrast, mixed strain male mice fed a HiE + O diet gained \u223c40% more weight than females on the same diet. In addition to increased weight gain, mixed genetic mice on the HiE + O diet cleared glucose normally but secreted more insulin. We concluded that sex and genetic background define weight gain and metabolic responses of mice on high caloric diets and OM.",

HER2/ERBB2 amplification/overexpression of upper gastrointestinal (UGI) adenocarcinomas was determined locally or in two central laboratories to select patients for the TRIO-013/LOGiC trial of chemotherapy with or without lapatinib. Patients selected locally had central laboratory confirmation of HER2 amplification for inclusion in the primary efficacy population. HER2 was assessed with PathVysion or IQ PharmDx FISH and HercepTest immunohistochemistry assays. Associations with outcomes were retrospectively evaluated. Overall, HER2 status was determined in UGI cancers from 4,674 patients in a central laboratory for eligibility (1,995 cases) and for confirmation of local HER2 results (333 cases). Of 1,995 adenocarcinomas screened centrally, 322 (16.1%) had HER2-amplified disease with 29 (1.5%) showing HER2 genomic heterogeneity. Men and older patients had higher rates of amplification. Of 545 patients accrued to the trial (gastric, 87.3%; GEJ, 8.3% and esophageal cancer, 4.4%), 487 patients (89%) were centrally confirmed as having HER2-amplified disease. Concordance between central and local HER2 testing was 83%. Concordance between PathVysion and IQ PharmDx FISH assays was 99% and FISH in the two central laboratories was 95%. Lapatinib-treated Asian participants and those less than 60 years had significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS), particularly among those whose cancers had 5.01-10.0 and >10.0-fold amplification of HER2 In conclusion, HER2 is commonly amplified in UGI adenocarcinomas with amplification highly correlated to overexpression, and HER2 amplification levels correlated with PFS. While HER2 genomic heterogeneity occurs, its prevalence is low. Mol Cancer Ther; 16(1); 228-38. \u00a92016 AACR.",

        "abstract": "Quantitative and qualitative changes in mRNA translation occur in tumor cells and support cancer progression and metastasis. Posttranscriptional modifications of transfer RNAs (tRNAs) at the wobble uridine 34 (U34) base are highly conserved and contribute to translation fidelity. Here, we show that ELP3 and CTU1/2, partner enzymes in U34 mcm5s2-tRNA modification, are up-regulated in human breast cancers and sustain metastasis. Elp3 genetic ablation strongly impaired invasion and metastasis formation in the PyMT model of invasive breast cancer. Mechanistically, ELP3 and CTU1/2 support cellular invasion through the translation of the oncoprotein DEK. As a result, DEK promotes the IRES-dependent translation of the proinvasive transcription factor LEF1. Consistently, a DEK mutant, whose codon composition is independent of U34 mcm5s2-tRNA modification, escapes the ELP3- and CTU1-dependent regulation and restores the IRES-dependent LEF1 expression. Our results demonstrate that the key role of U34 tRNA modification is to support specific translation during breast cancer progression and highlight a functional link between tRNA modification- and IRES-dependent translation during tumor cell invasion and metastasis.",

        "abstract": "Polycomb group (PcG) proteins are evolutionarily conserved chromatin modifiers that regulate developmental pathways in plants. PcGs form nuclear multi-subunit Polycomb Repressive Complexes (PRCs). The PRC2 complex mediates gene repression via methylation of lysine 27 on histone H3, which consequently leads to chromatin condensation. In Arabidopsis thaliana, several PRC2 complexes with different compositions were identified, each controlling a particular developmental program.The core subunit FIE is crucial for PRC2 function throughout the plant life cycle, yet accurate information on its spatial and temporal localization was absent. This study focused on identifying FIE accumulation patterns, using microscopy and biochemical approaches. Analysing endogenous FIE and transgenic gFIE-green fluorescent protein fusion protein (gFIE-GFP) showed that FIE accumulates in the nuclei of every cell type examined. Interestingly, gFIE-GFP, as well as the endogenous FIE, also localized to the cytoplasm in all examined tissues. In both vegetative and reproductive organs, FIE formed cytoplasmic high-molecular-mass complexes, in parallel to the nuclear PRC2 complexes. Moreover, size-exclusion chromatography and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays indicated that in inflorescences FIE formed a cytoplasmic complex with MEA, a PRC2 histone methyltransferase subunit. In contrast, CLF and SWN histone methyltransferases were strictly nuclear. Presence of PRC2 subunits in cytoplasmic complexes has not been previously described in plants. Our findings are in agreement with accumulating evidence demonstrating cytoplasmic localization and function of PcGs in metazoa. The cytosolic accumulation of PRC2 components in plants supports the model that PcGs have alternative non-nuclear functions that go beyond chromatin methylation.",

A validated instrument is essential to quantify damage in individual patients and to compare disease outcomes in clinical studies. Currently, there is no such tool. Our objective was to develop a common autoinflammatory disease damage index (ADDI) for familial Mediterranean fever, cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes, tumour necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic fever syndrome and mevalonate kinase deficiency.\nMETHODS: We developed the ADDI by consensus building. The top 40 enrollers of patients in the Eurofever Registry and 9 experts from the Americas participated in multiple rounds of online surveys to select items and definitions. Further, 22 (parents of) patients rated damage items and suggested new items. A consensus meeting was held to refine the items and definitions, which were then formally weighted in a scoring system derived using decision-making software, known as 1000minds.\nRESULTS: More than 80% of the experts and patients completed the online surveys. The preliminary ADDI contains 18 items, categorised in the following eight organ systems: reproductive, renal/amyloidosis, developmental, serosal, neurological, ears, ocular and musculoskeletal damage. The categories renal/amyloidosis and neurological damage were assigned the highest number of points, serosal damage the lowest number of points. The involvement of (parents of) patients resulted in the inclusion of, for example, chronic musculoskeletal pain.\nCONCLUSIONS: An instrument to measure damage caused by autoinflammatory diseases is developed based on consensus building.

GlycA and smaller HDL subclasses had independent but opposite effects on mortality risk prediction, with smaller HDL subclasses being protective [HR 0.69 (0.66-0.72), P < 0.0001]. There was an interaction between GlycA and smaller HDL subclasses-increasing GlycA concentrations attenuated the inverse association of smaller HDL subclasses with mortality. Adding GlycA and smaller HDL subclasses into the GRACE (Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events) and Framingham Heart Study Risk Scores improved mortality risk prediction, discrimination and reclassification.\nCONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the interaction of systemic inflammation and HDL with clinical outcomes and may increase precision for clinical risk assessment in secondary prevention populations.",

Many studies have suggested that genetic factors play an important role in the onset and development of schizophrenia. In our study, we conducted a case-control study in a northern Chinese Han population of 499 schizophrenia patients and 500 controls to investigate the effect of variant genotypes of 13 SNPs in ANK3 on schizophrenia risk. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using the chi-squared test, genetic model analysis, and haplotype analysis. Four ANK3 SNPs were associated with schizophrenia risk. The minor allele of rs958852 in ANK3 was associated with a 0.75-fold reduction in schizophrenia risk in an allelic model. In the genetic model, rs958852 was associated with a reduced schizophrenia risk, and rs10994336, rs10994338 and rs4948418 were associated with an increased schizophrenia risk (rs10994336, OR = 2.00, 95%CI: 1.01-3.94, p = 0.047; rs10994338, OR = 1.99, 95%CI: 1.01-3.93, p = 0.047; rs4948418, OR = 2.00, 95%CI: 1.01-3.94, p = 0.047).

We explored patients' compliance with diet-diaries usage in a paediatric clinic within a teaching hospital setting, where remuneration is not an issue. Objectives were to investigate associated factors affecting diet diaries return rate and the information obtained from returned diaries.Methods A retrospective study of 200 randomly selected clinical records of children aged 5-11 years who had received diet analysis and advice as part of a preventive dental care programme at a dental teaching hospital between 2010 and 2013. Clinical records, with a preventive care pro forma, were included in the study. Data on social and family history, DMFT-dmft, oral hygiene practices, dental attendance and dietary habits were obtained and compared with information given in completed diet-diaries. A deductive content analysis of returned diet-diaries was undertaken using a pre-developed coding scheme.Results Of 174 complete records included in this study, diet diaries were returned in 60 (34.5%) of them. Diet diaries were more likely to be returned by those children who reported that they regularly brushed their teeth (P <0.05), and those who came from smaller families (P <0.05). Content analysis of diet diaries enabled the identification of harmful types of foods and drinks in 100% of diaries. General dietary issues, frequency and between-meals intake of sugars were also all captured in the majority of diaries (95.0%, N = 56). Information on sugar amount (53.0%, N = 32), prolonged-contact with teeth (57.0%, N = 34) and near bedtime intakes (17.0%, N = 28) was reported in fewer diaries.Conclusions The return rate of diet-diaries in this setting was low, and associated with patients' demographic and oral health characteristics. Returned diet-diaries showed a varied range of missing important dietary information, such as sugar amount, which appears to compromise their validity as a diet assessment tool. Development of a more reliable and acceptable dietary assessment tool for use in the dental setting is needed.",

Individual rat skeletal myotubes cultured on micrometer sized gold mushroom-shaped microelectrode (gM\u03bcE) based MEA tightly engulf the gM\u03bcEs, forming a high seal resistance between the myotubes and the gM\u03bcEs. As a consequence, spontaneous action potentials generated by the contracting myotubes are recorded as extracellular field potentials with amplitudes of up to 10\u2009mV for over 14 days. Application of a 10\u2009ms, 0.5-0.9\u2009V voltage pulse through the gM\u03bcEs electroporated the myotube membrane, and transiently converted the extracellular to intracellular recording mode for 10-30\u2009min.

Predicting orthology relationships between species is a vital component of comparative biology. Dozens of strategies for predicting orthologs have been developed using combinations of gene and protein sequence, phylogenetic history, and functional interaction with progressively increasing accuracy. A relatively new class of orthology prediction strategies combines aspects of multiple methods into meta-tools, resulting in improved prediction performance. Here we present WORMHOLE, a novel ortholog prediction meta-tool that applies machine learning to integrate 17 distinct ortholog prediction algorithms to identify novel least diverged orthologs (LDOs) between 6 eukaryotic species-humans, mice, zebrafish, fruit flies, nematodes, and budding yeast. Machine learning allows WORMHOLE to intelligently incorporate predictions from a wide-spectrum of strategies in order to form aggregate predictions of LDOs with high confidence. In this study we demonstrate the performance of WORMHOLE across each combination of query and target species. We show that WORMHOLE is particularly adept at improving LDO prediction performance between distantly related species, expanding the pool of LDOs while maintaining low evolutionary distance and a high level of functional relatedness between genes in LDO pairs. We present extensive validation, including cross-validated prediction of PANTHER LDOs and evaluation of evolutionary divergence and functional similarity, and discuss future applications of machine learning in ortholog prediction.

Although experiments relying on model organisms and cytoplasmic hybrids, as well as disease association studies, have served to underline the functionality of certain mtDNA SNPs, only little is known of the regulatory impact of ancient mtDNA variants, especially in terms of gene expression. By analyzing RNA-seq data of 454 lymphoblast cell lines from the 1000 Genomes Project, we found that mtDNA variants defining the most common African genetic background, the L haplogroup, exhibit a distinct overall mtDNA gene expression pattern, which was independent of mtDNA copy numbers. Secondly, intra-population analysis revealed subtle, yet significant, expression differences in four tRNA genes. Strikingly, the more prominent African mtDNA gene expression pattern best correlated with the expression of nuclear DNA-encoded RNA-binding proteins, and with SNPs within the mitochondrial RNA-binding proteins PTCD1 and MRPS7. Our results thus support the concept of an ancient regulatory transition of mtDNA-encoded genes as humans left Africa to populate the rest of the world.",

        "abstract": "NOD2 contributes to the innate immune response and to the homeostasis of the intestinal mucosa. In response to its bacterial ligand, NOD2 interacts with RICK and activates the NF-\u03baB and MAPK pathways, inducing gene transcription and synthesis of proteins required to initiate a balanced immune response. Mutations in NOD2 have been associated with an increased risk of Crohn's Disease (CD), a disabling inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Because NOD2 signaling plays a key role in CD, it is important to further characterize the network of protein interacting with NOD2. Using yeast two hybrid (Y2H) screens, we identified new NOD2 interacting proteins (NIP). The primary interaction was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation and/or bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) experiments for 11 of these proteins (ANKHD1, CHMP5, SDCCAG3, TRIM41, LDOC1, PPP1R12C, DOCK7, VIM, KRT15, PPP2R3B, and C10Orf67). These proteins are involved in diverse functions, including endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT), cytoskeletal architecture and signaling regulation. Additionally, we show that the interaction of 8 NIPs is compromised with the 3 main CD associated NOD2 mutants (R702W, G908R and 1007fs). Furthermore, to determine whether these NOD2 protein partners could be encoded by IBD susceptibility genes, a transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) was performed on 101 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the main corresponding haplotypes in genes coding for 15 NIPs using a set of 343 IBD families with 556 patients. Overall this work did not increase the number of IBD susceptibility genes but extends the NOD2 protein interaction network and suggests that NOD2 interactome and signaling depend upon the NOD2 mutation profile in CD.",

        "title": "The Modular Adaptive Ribosome.",
        "abstract": "The ribosome is an ancient machine, performing the same function across organisms. Although functionally unitary, recent experiments suggest specialized roles for some ribosomal proteins. Our central thesis is that ribosomal proteins function in a modular fashion to decode genetic information in a context dependent manner. We show through large data analyses that although many ribosomal proteins are essential with consistent effect on growth in different conditions in yeast and similar expression across cell and tissue types in mice and humans, some ribosomal proteins are used in an environment specific manner. The latter set of variable ribosomal proteins further function in a coordinated manner forming modules, which are adapted to different environmental cues in different organisms. We show that these environment specific modules of ribosomal proteins in yeast have differential genetic interactions with other pathways and their 5'UTRs show differential signatures of selection in yeast strains, presumably to facilitate adaptation. Similarly, we show that in higher metazoans such as mice and humans, different modules of ribosomal proteins are expressed in different cell types and tissues. A clear example is nervous tissue that uses a ribosomal protein module distinct from the rest of the tissues in both mice and humans. Our results suggest a novel stratification of ribosomal proteins that could have played a role in adaptation, presumably to optimize translation for adaptation to diverse ecological niches and tissue microenvironments.",

        "title": "Viability-PCR Shows That NAAT Detects a High Proportion of DNA from Non-Viable Chlamydia trachomatis.",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: According to the current guidelines for laboratory diagnosis of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) are the preferred diagnostic method for Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) infections. However, NAATs amplify the available target DNA without discriminating between DNA originating from viable or non-viable CT. Assessing CT viability will provide more insights in the clinical and public health relevance of a CT positive test result. The aim of this study was to technically validate and implement viability-PCR (V-PCR) to asses CT viability.\nMETHODS: Technical validation of V-PCR was performed by the assessment of predefined viability ratios of CT. Samples were subjected to V-PCR which consisted of propidium monoazide (PMA) treatment prior to DNA extraction followed by quantitative PCR (qPCR) targeting the ompA gene for the detection of CT DNA. Finally, V-PCR was applied to vaginal swabs of 50 CT positive patients, as indicated by routine NAAT, collected at our outpatient STD clinics before antimicrobial treatment.\nRESULTS: Technical validation of V-PCR showed that PMA treatment of heat-inactivated CT culture resulted in an almost complete loss of qPCR signal. PMA treated samples of the fresh viable CT culture showed no marked reduction of PCR signal, indicating that all DNA from viable CT could be detected. Applying V-PCR to clinical samples showed that in 36% of samples (18/50) less than 1% of CT DNA originated from viable bacteria.\nCONCLUSIONS: V-PCR showed to be a fast and easy method to assess CT viability in clinical samples, without the need of traditional challenging cell culture methods. Furthermore, V-PCR results of clinical samples have indicated that a substantial amount of the amplified CT DNA originated from non-viable cells. Although results might be influenced by cell death during transport, this study suggests that there is a potential overestimation of quantitative CT positivity by currently used NAATs.",

        "abstract": "The prenatal determination of the fetal Rh genotype could lead to a substantial reduction in the use of anti-D immunoglobulin and prevention of unnecessary exposure of pregnant women carrying RhD negative fetus. The aim of this study was fetal RHD genotyping through the analysis of cffDNA in plasma samples of RhD negative pregnant women by real-time PCR technique. In this experiment, 30 plasma samples were collected from RhD negative pregnant women. DNA were extracted and real-time PCR reactions were done by specific primers for RHD, SRY and beta-globin (GLO) genes. The Rh phenotypes of mothers and their babies were determined by agglutination method and specific anti-serums. From the 30 maternal plasma samples considered for SRY genotyping, 16 samples revealed the presence of the SRY gene. Regarding the fetal RHD genotyping, 26 samples were positive for RhD and 4 samples were negative. In all cases, the predicted RhD and SRY genotypes were in concordance with the serologically determined phenotypes. The sensitivity, specificity and precision of the fetal RHD and SRY genotyping test were calculated 100\u00a0% (p value &lt;0.0005; K\u00a0=\u00a0100\u00a0%). The present study confirms the precision of fetal RHD and SRY genotyping in maternal plasma by real-time PCR technique. This method helps RhD negative pregnant women about the appropriate use of anti-D immunoglobulin and also on the management and prevention of HDFN. However, superior and confirmatory studies are recommended before fetal RHD genotyping by real-time PCR is introduced as a non-invasive prenatal screening test.",

Besides well established methods, multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification (MLPA) is known as an effective, simple and specific method for the detection and characterization of deletions and duplications. We employed MLPA testing to 30 patients with hematological parameters suggestive of \u03b1-thalassemia carrier status but was negative for \u03b1-thalassemia with conventional reverse dot blot hybridization (RDB). We found \u03b1-globin gene deletions in 3 out of 30 (10\u00a0%) patients with MLPA. We propose that MLPA can be used as a second tier test in addition to other techniques such as RDB to identify \u03b1-thalassemia carriers in high prevalence regions such as ours, thereby allowing clinicians to provide accurate genetic counselling.",

Subsequent epidemics of growing incidence occurred in French Polynesia and other South Pacific Islands, and recently, in the Americas. The latter and currently ongoing outbreak of unprecedented incidence revealed the association of ZIKV infection with the occurrence of severe congenital malformations and neurological diseases, leading to a widespread concern about its potential to pose a global public health threat. Serological and molecular data suggest that the genetic and geographic diversification of ZIKV may be greatly underestimated.

        "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Autoimmune diseases represent a significant medical burden affecting up to 5-8% of the U.S.\nPOPULATION: While genetics is known to play a role, studies of common autoimmune diseases are complicated by phenotype heterogeneity, limited sample sizes, and a single disease approach. Here we performed a targeted genetic association study for cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and Crohn's disease (CD) to assess which common genetic variants contribute individually and pleiotropically to disease risk. Joint modeling and pathway analysis combining the three phenotypes were performed to identify common underlying mechanisms of risk of autoimmune conditions. European American cases of MS, RA, and CD, (n = 119, 53, and 129, respectively) and 1924 controls were identified using de-identified electronic health records (EHRs) through a combination of International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) billing codes, Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes, medication lists, and text matching. As expected, hallmark SNPs in MS, such as DQA1 rs9271366 (OR = 1.91; p = 0.008), replicated in the present study. Both MS and CD were associated with TIMMDC1 rs2293370 (OR = 0.27, p = 0.01; OR = 0.25, p = 0.02; respectively). Additionally, PDE2A rs3781913 was significantly associated with both CD and RA (OR = 0.46, p = 0.02; OR = 0.32, p = 0.02; respectively). Joint modeling and pathway analysis identified variants within the KEGG NOD-like receptor signaling pathway and Shigellosis pathway as being correlated with the combined autoimmune phenotype. Our study replicated previously-reported genetic associations for MS and CD in a population derived from de-identified EHRs. We found evidence to support a shared genetic etiology between CD/MS and CD/RA outside of the major histocompatibility complex region and identified KEGG pathways indicative of a bacterial pathogenesis risk for autoimmunity in a joint model. Future work to elucidate this shared etiology will be key in the development of risk models as envisioned in the era of precision medicine.",

We tested a cohort of intravenous drug users (IVDU) diagnosed with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) for treatment response and its association with the SNPs in the interleukin-6 (rs1800795-IL6) and the interleukin-28B (rs12979860-IL28B) genes.\nMETHODS: The study included 110 Croatian IVDU positive for anti-HCV antibody. Genotyping was performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based approach. Patients were treated by standard pegylated-interferon/ribavirin and followed throughout a period of four years, during which sustained virological response (SVR) was determined. All data were analysed with statistical package SPSS 19.0 (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY, USA) and PLINK v1.07 software.\nRESULTS: Patients showed a significantly better response to treatment according to the number of copies of the C allele carried at rs1800795-IL6 (P = 0.034). All but one of the patients with CC genotype achieved SVR (93%), whereas the response rate of patients with GG genotype was 64%. The association of rs1800795-IL6 with SVR status remained significant after further adjustment for patients' age, fibrosis staging, and viral genotype (OR 2.15, 95% CI 1.16-4.68, P = 0.019). Distributions of allele frequencies at the locus rs12979860-IL28B among the study cohort and the underlying general population were suggestive of a protective effect of CC genotype in acquiring chronic hepatitis C in the Croatian IVDU population.\nDISCUSSION: The rs1800795-IL6 polymorphism is associated with positive response to treatment in IVDU patients positive for HCV infection. A protective role of rs12979860-IL28B CC genotype in acquiring chronic hepatitis C is suggested for Croatian IVDU population.",

In this study, we conducted an integrative analysis on multiple datasets to identify potential shared genes that are significant in multiple tissues/cells for RA. Seven microarray gene expression datasets representing various RA-related tissues/cells were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Statistical analyses, testing both marginal and joint effects, were conducted to identify significant genes shared in various samples. Followed-up analyses were conducted on functional annotation clustering analysis, protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis, gene-based association analysis, and ELISA validation analysis in in-house samples. We identified 18 shared significant genes, which were mainly involved in the immune response and chemokine signaling pathway. Among the 18 genes, eight genes (PPBP, PF4, HLA-F, S100A8, RNASEH2A, P2RY6, JAG2, and PCBP1) interact with known RA genes.

        "abstract": "PURPOSES: We aim to investigate associations of the child's individual characteristics, building characteristics, home environmental exposures, family lifestyle behaviors, and dietary habits on childhood eczema during lifetime-ever and in the last year before the survey.\nMETHODS: During April 2011-April 2012, we conducted a cross-sectional study and collected 13,335 parents-reported questionnaires of 4-6-year-old children from 72 kindergartens in Shanghai, China. Logistic regression model was used to investigate associations.\nRESULTS: After adjusted for sex, age, family history of atopy, and questionnaire reporter, the factors which were strongly associated (increased odds >30% and p value <0.05) with lifetime-ever eczema included mother employed during pregnancy (adjusted OR 1.33), residence renovated during pregnancy (1.49) and in the child's first year of life (1.31), using laminate (1.58) and solid (1.42) wood as material of floor covering (compared to using cement), residence located in urban district (1.38), and dampness-related exposures in the early residence (mold spots/stains: 1.41; mold odor: 1.41) and in the current residence (water damage: 1.33; damp stains: 1.34; mold spots: 1.32; and windows pane condensation: 1.31). Parental smoking, pet-keeping, and incense-burning had no significant associations with childhood eczema. Similar associations were found for eczema in the last year before the survey. Families with sick children likely changed lifestyle behaviors and dietary habits.\nCONCLUSIONS: Childhood eczema could be influenced by many household environmental and non-environmental factors. Exposures during early lifetime likely have greater impact on childhood eczema than current exposures. Associations of lifestyle behaviors and dietary habits with childhood eczema could be modified by family avoidance behaviors.",

Moreover, the following parameters were assessed: 1.\u00a0Age distribution at initial diagnosis; 2.\u00a0Percentage of patients with in utero diagnosis of TSC; 3.\u00a0Detailed description of pathological clinical findings; 4.\u00a0Results from genetic testing.\nRESULTS: In this one-year interim analysis, 84\u00a0electronic questionnaires were received, 17 of which did not contain complete sets of data and were not included in data analysis. Twenty-three of 67\u00a0questionnaires did not report TSC patients and 3\u00a0reports contained redundant data sets and were excluded. In total, 41\u00a0reports were included into data analysis (female: 23; male: 18); median age at first diagnosis was 6\u00a0months (range: 0-151\u00a0months). The three most common symptoms were: central nervous affection: 31/41\u00a0patients ((75.6\u2009%); 29/31 with seizures); rhabdomyoma: in 20/41 (48.8\u2009%); cutaneous affection: hypomelanotic maculae (\"white spots\"): 20/41 (48.8\u2009%). The three following organ manifestations were seen most often in a\u00a0comprehensive diagnostic work-up: rhabdomyoma: 23/41 ((56.1\u2009%); cortical dysplasia: 22/41 (53.7\u2009%); \"white spots\"): 20/41 (48.8\u2009%).

This emergent epidemic represents the next great challenge for biomedical science and public health. Fortunately, decades of studies into the biology of aging have provided a head start by revealing an evolutionarily conserved network of genes that controls the rate and quality of the aging process itself and which can thereby be targeted for protection against age-onset disease. A number of dietary, genetic, and pharmacological interventions, including dietary restriction (DR) and the biguanide metformin, can extend healthy lifespan and reduce the incidence of multiple chronic conditions. Many of these interventions recurrently involve a core network of nutrient sensors: AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), the insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling pathway (IIS), and the sirtuins. Here, we will summarize how AMPK acts downstream of these pro-longevity interventions and within this network of nutrient sensors to control the cell and physiological processes important for defining how well we age.",

        "abstract": "Despite several scientific and technological advances, there is no single neuroprotective treatment that can reverse the brain damage after acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Neuroactive steroids are cholesterol-derived hormones that have the ability to modulate the normal and pathologic nervous system employing genomic and nongenomic mechanisms. In this work, we first investigated if AIS affects the plasma concentration of 5 neuroactive steroids (cortisol, estradiol, progesterone, testosterone, and 3\u03b1-androstenediol glucuronide). Second, we studied if levels of circulating steroids associate with neurological, cognitive, and functional outcome in a cohort of 60- to 90 year-old male and female patients with AIS. For this purpose, we recruited patients who were hospitalized at the Emergency Room of the Central Military Hospital within the first 24\u2009h after stroke onset. We designed 2 experimental groups, each one composed of 30 control subjects and 30 AIS patients, both males and females. The assessment of neurological deficit was performed with the NIHSS and the tests used for the functional and cognitive status were: (1) modified Rankin Scale; (2) Photo test, and (3) abbreviated Pfeiffer's mental status questionnaire. We observed a significant difference in plasma concentration of cortisol and estradiol between both experimental groups. In the AIS group, higher levels of these neuroactive steroids were associated with more pronounced neurological, cognitive and functional deficits in women compared to men. We propose that in elderly patients, high levels of circulating neuroactive steroids like cortisol and estradiol could potentiate AIS-mediated neuropathology in the ischemic and penumbra areas.",

        "abstract": "The canalization hypothesis postulates that the rate at which trait variation generates variation in the average individual fitness in a population determines how buffered traits are against environmental and genetic factors. The ranking of a species on the slow-fast continuum - the covariation among life-history traits describing species-specific life cycles along a gradient going from a long life, slow maturity, and low annual reproductive output, to a short life, fast maturity, and high annual reproductive output - strongly correlates with the relative fitness impact of a given amount of variation in adult survival. Under the canalization hypothesis, long-lived species are thus expected to display less individual heterogeneity in survival at the onset of adulthood, when reproductive values peak, than short-lived species. We tested this life-history prediction by analysing long-term time series of individual-based data in nine species of birds and mammals using capture-recapture models. We found that individual heterogeneity in survival was higher in species with short-generation time (< 3 years) than in species with long generation time (> 4 years). Our findings provide the first piece of empirical evidence for the canalization hypothesis at the individual level from the wild.",

These microbial communities originate in the vineyard and the winery and reflect the influence of several factors including grape variety, geographical location, climate, vineyard spraying, technological practices, processing stage and season (pre-harvest, harvest, post-harvest). Vineyard and winery microbial communities have the potential to participate during fermentation and influence wine flavour and aroma. Therefore, there is an enormous interest in isolating and characterising these communities, particularly non-Saccharomyces yeast species to increase wine flavour diversity, while also exploting regional signature microbial populations to enhance regionality. In this review we describe the role and relevance of the main non-Saccharomyces yeast species found in vineyards and wineries. This includes the latest reports covering the application of these species for winemaking; and the biotechnological characteristics and potential applications of non-Saccharomyces species in other areas. In particular, we focus attention on the species for which molecular and genomic tools and resources are available for study. Copyright \u00a9 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

Although low-coverage sequencing offers low cost but inadequacy in calling rare variants, high coverage is able to detect essentially every variant but at a high cost. Two-stage sequencing may be an economical way to conduct GAS without losing power. In two-stage sequencing, an affordable number of samples are sequenced at high coverage as the reference panel, then to impute in a larger sample is sequenced at low coverage. As unit sequencing costs continue to decrease, investigators can now conduct GAS with more flexible sequencing depths. Here, we systematically evaluate the effect of the read depth and sample size on the variant discovery power and association power for study designs using low-coverage, high-coverage, and two-stage sequencing. We consider 12 low-coverage, 12 high-coverage, and 51 two-stage design scenarios with the read depth varying from 0.5\u00d7 to 80\u00d7. With state-of-the-art simulation and analysis packages and in-house scripts, we simulate the complete study process from DNA sequencing to SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) calling and association testing. Our results show that with appropriate allocation of sequencing effort, two-stage sequencing is an effective approach for conducting GAS.

        "abstract": "Monitoring intraocular pressure (IOP) is a critically important part of glaucoma management; however, clinical tonometry predominantly involves sitting postures and is unable to detect variations in response to posture changes, muscular effort, deep respirations and during a wide range of activities, such as playing high wind-resistance instruments and wearing swimming goggles in addition to eye touching and rubbing. For example, the usefulness of 24-hour tonometric phasing may be increased, if nocturnal assessments included side and prone sleeping postures rather than being limited to supine posture tonometry. Continuous monitoring of IOP, which allows unrestricted involvement in a full range of sleep and non-sleep IOP elevating activities would provide an ideal method of quantifying the frequency, duration and degree of episodes of elevation in addition to physiological and pathological circadian rhythmic variations due to treatment. Apart from the degree of exposure to episodes of elevation of IOP, genetic influences and family history of glaucoma, other factors which are or could be associated with increased susceptibility to develop or progress glaucomatous pathology include age, frailty, race, type and degree of refractive error, systemic hypotension and hypertension, vasospasm, migraine, pigmentary dispersion syndrome, pseudoexfoliation syndrome, obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome, diabetes as well as medication interactions and side effects. Such information, when combined with all details relating to episodes of elevation of IOP, appears likely to be a strong basis for the detection, diagnosis and treatment of glaucoma. This review examines the limitations of methods of longitudinal monitoring of IOP with reference to their validity and the varying degrees of invasiveness involved. Also mentioned is the potential value of knowing the frequency, duration and level of variations of optic nerve subarachnoid space pressure, as the interaction of such changes with IOP and their potential influence on the lamina cribrosa, may help determine pathological significance.",

        "abstract": "A Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis is performed to analyze the causal effect of an exposure variable on a disease outcome in observational studies, by using genetic variants that affect the disease outcome only through the exposure variable. This method has recently gained popularity among epidemiologists given the success of genetic association studies. Many exposure variables of interest in epidemiological studies are time varying, for example, body mass index (BMI). Although longitudinal data have been collected in many cohort studies, current MR studies only use one measurement of a time-varying exposure variable, which cannot adequately capture the long-term time-varying information. We propose using the functional principal component analysis method to recover the underlying individual trajectory of the time-varying exposure from the sparsely and irregularly observed longitudinal data, and then conduct MR analysis using the recovered curves. We further propose two MR analysis methods. The first assumes a cumulative effect of the time-varying exposure variable on the disease risk, while the second assumes a time-varying genetic effect and employs functional regression models. We focus on statistical testing for a causal effect. Our simulation studies mimicking the real data show that the proposed functional data analysis based methods incorporating longitudinal data have substantial power gains compared to standard MR analysis using only one measurement. We used the Framingham Heart Study data to demonstrate the promising performance of the new methods as well as inconsistent results produced by the standard MR analysis that relies on a single measurement of the exposure at some arbitrary time point.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE The incidence of primary spinal cord glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) in the pediatric age group is very rare. Only a few case series and case reports have been published in the literature; therefore, overall survival (OS) outcome and the as-yet poorly defined management options are not discussed in detail. The authors performed a cumulative survival analysis of all reported cases of pediatric spinal cord GBM to identify the predictive factors related to final survival outcome. METHODS A comprehensive search for relevant articles was performed on PubMed's electronic database MEDLINE for the period from 1950 to 2015 using the search words \"malignant spinal cord tumor\" and \"spinal glioblastoma multiforme.\" This study was limited to patients younger than 18 years of age. Survival rates for children with various tumor locations and treatments were collected from the published articles and analyzed. RESULTS After an extensive literature search, 29 articles met the study inclusion criteria. From the detailed information in these articles, the authors found 53 children eligible for the survival analysis. The majority (45%) of the children were more than 12 years old. Thirty-four percent of the cases were between 7 and 12 years of age, and 21% were younger than 7 years. In the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, children younger than 7 years of age had better survival (13 months) than the children older than 7 years (7-12 years: 10 months, > 12 years: 9 months; p = 0.01, log-rank test). Fifty-five percent of the children were female and 45% were male. A cervical tumor location (32%) was the most common, followed by thoracic (28.3%). Cervicothoracic (18.9%) and conus (18.8%) tumor locations shared the same percentage of cases. Cervical tumors had a worse outcome than tumors in other locations (p = 0.003, log-rank test). The most common presenting symptom was limb weakness (53%), followed by sensory disturbances (25%). Median OS was 10 months. The addition of adjuvant therapy (radiotherapy [RT] and/or chemotherapy [CT]) after surgery significantly improved OS (p = 0.01, log-rank test). Children who underwent gross-total resection and RT had better outcomes than those who underwent subtotal resection and RT (p = 0.04, log-rank test). Cerebrospinal fluid spread, hydrocephalus, brain metastasis, and spinal metastasis were not correlated with OS in primary spinal GBM. CONCLUSIONS Adjuvant therapy after surgery had a beneficial effect on overall outcome of spinal GBM in the pediatric age group. Gross-total resection followed by RT produced a better outcome than subtotal resection with RT. Further large-scale prospective study is required to establish the genetic and molecular factors related to OS in primary GBM of the spinal cord in pediatric patients.",

        "abstract": "Sunflower cannot produce high yields under water-limiting conditions. The aim of the present study was to prevent the impediments on yield and to develop varieties with high-yield potential under water scarce conditions. For achieving this objective, it is necessary to detect parents with desirable traits that mainly depend on the action of genes controlling the trait under improvement, combining ability, and genetic makeup of the parents. Heterosis can also be used to pool the desirable genes from genetically divergent varieties and these divergent parents could be detected by molecular studies. Ten tolerant and five susceptible tester lines were selected, crossed, and tested for genetic diversity using simple sequence repeat primers. We identified two parents (A-10.8 and G-60) that showed maximum (46.7%) genetic dissimilarity. On an average 3.1 alleles per locus were detected for twenty pair of primers. Evaluation of mean values revealed that under stress conditions the mean performances of the genotypes were reduced for all traits under study. Parent A-10.8 was consistent as a good general combiner for achene yield per plant under both non-stress and stress conditions. Line A-10.8 in the hybrid A-10.8 x G-60 proved to be a good combiner as it showed negative specific combining ability (SCA) effects for plant height and internodal length and positive SCA effects for head weight, achene yield per plant, and membrane stability index. Valuable information on gene action, combining ability, and heterosis was generated, which could be used in further breeding programs.",

The aim of the present study was to analyze genetic diversity, verify correlations between traits, estimate genetic parameters, and select different accessions of A. aculeata in the Macaw Palm Germplasm Bank located in Universidade Federal de Vi\u00e7osa, to develop a breeding program for this species. Accessions were selected based on precocity (PREC), total spathe (TS), diameter at breast height (DBH), height of the first spathe (HFS), and canopy area (CA). The traits were evaluated in 52 accessions during the 2012/2013 season and analyzed by restricted estimation maximum likelihood/best linear unbiased predictor procedures. Genetic diversity resulted in the formation of four groups by Tocher's clustering method. The correlation analysis showed it was possible to have indirect and early selection for the traits PREC and DBH. Estimated genetic parameters strengthened the genetic variability verified by cluster analysis. Narrow-sense heritability was classified as moderate (PREC, TS, and CA) to high (HFS and DBH), resulting in strong genetic control of the traits and success in obtaining genetic gains by selection. Accuracy values were classified as moderate (PREC and CA) to high (TS, HFS, and DBH), reinforcing the success of the selection process. Selection of accessions for PREC, TS, and HFS by the rank-average method permits selection gains of over 100%, emphasizing the successful use of the accessions in breeding programs and obtaining superior genotypes for commercial plantations.",

        "abstract": "Dipterocarpus costatus is an endangered species restricted to the lowland forests of southern Vietnam. Habitat loss and over-exploitation of D. costatus wood are the major threats to this species. We investigated the level of genetic variability within and among populations of D. costatus in order to provide guidelines for the conservation, management, and restoration of this species to the Forest Protection Department, Vietnam. Nine microsatellite markers were used to analyze 114 samples from four populations representing the natural range of D. costatus in southeast Vietnam. We indicated the low allelic diversity (N<sub>A</sub> = 2.3) and low genetic diversities with an average observed and expected heterozygosity of 0.130 and 0.151, respectively, in the lowland forests of southeast Vietnam. The low genetic diversity might be a consequence of inbreeding within the small and isolated populations of D. costatus owing to its habitat loss and over-exploitation. All populations deviated from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium showing reduced heterozygosity. Alleles were lost from the populations by genetic drift. Genetic differentiation among populations was high (average pairwise F<sub>ST</sub> = 0.405), indicating low gene flow (&lt;1) and isolated populations due to its destructed habitat and large geographical distances (P &lt; 0.05) among populations. Heterozygosity excess tests (except of Bu Gia Map only under infinite allele model) were negative. The high genetic variation (62.7%) was found within populations. The STRUCTURE and neighbor joining tree results suggest strong differentiation among D. costatus populations, with the three genetic clusters, Phu Quoc, Tan Phu and Bu Gia Map, and Lo Go-Xa Mat due to habitat fragmentation and isolation. The threatened status of D. costatus was related to a lack of genetic diversity, with all its populations isolated in small forest patches. We recommend the establishment of an ex situ conservation site for D. costatus with a new big population comprising all genetic groups in order to enhance its survival under different environmental stresses.",

Polyploidy results in genetic variation among individuals of the same species and even between populations, and may be responsible for differences in environmental tolerance between populations of the same species. This study determined chromosome numbers of Eugenia L. (Myrtaceae, x = 11) for 26 populations of 14 species by conventional cytogenetic techniques. Nine species (13 populations) were diploid (2n = 2x = 22), but diploid and/or polyploid cytotypes were found in the other five species (13 populations), with 2n = 33, 2n = 44, and 2n = 55. Data on chromosome number/ploidy level for other Eugenia species/populations were collected from the literature and included in this cytogeographic analysis. For each collection point (32 species and 62 populations), environmental variables were recorded using georeferencing techniques through the DIVA-GIS v.7.5 program. Environmental variables such as temperature, altitude, rainfall, solar radiation, soil type, and vegetation were analyzed with the R program, using Mann-Whitney and chi-square tests, principal component analysis, and graphic analyses, such as scatterplots, boxplots, and barplot. Polyploid and diploid populations had different spatial distribution patterns and were found in areas subjected to different environmental conditions. Polyploid individuals were collected from locations with more adverse environmental conditions, usually at higher elevations than the diploid individuals. Polyploidy allows species to occur at locations with varying environmental conditions. As diploidy and polyploidy occur under different environmental conditions, species with cytotypes exhibit wide environmental tolerance.",

Increased incidences of anxiety, depression, substance abuse, psychotic and behavioral disorders, and sexual disorders have been reported in patients with KS. The aim of this case study was to report a case of a man with untreated KS who was also diagnosed with type II bipolar disorder. This case report raises awareness regarding psychiatric diagnoses that may be associated with such a highly prevalent condition. A 46-year-old man who had previously been diagnosed with an untreated KS was examined in our Psychiatric Department with an acute hypomanic episode. Clinical improvement was observed within 4 days and psychiatric symptoms were resolved in 7 days without use of medication. A psychiatric history of a depressive episode and at least two hypomanic episodes, as well as a family history of two relatives diagnosed with bipolar disorder, strongly suggest that our patient has type II bipolar disorder. Bipolar disorder may be a comorbid disorder in patients with KS. Routine screening for mood disorders and appropriate referral and evaluation should be performed. Future genetic research is warranted to explore why some chromosomal abnormalities (e.g., duplications), especially those located on the X chromosome, such as Klinefelter syndrome, may be associated with a bipolar or psychotic disorder in some individuals but not in others.",

The Embrapa Eastern Amazon set up an active germplasm bank (BAG) consisting of 22 accessions sampled in 11 municipalities of Par\u00e1 State. Due to its economic potential, there is an interest to advance the genetic breeding program of this species. The aim of this study was to characterize the BAG nanche collection using inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers. Accessions were genotyped using 23 pre-selected ISSR primers resulting in 109 amplified polymorphic and 51 monomorphic bands. With eight polymorphic bands each, the most polymorphic primers were UBC 809 and UBC 848. An unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic average cluster analysis based on Jaccard's coefficient indicated that the individuals clustered into two distinct groups. Accessions Igarap\u00e9 A\u00e7u-2 and Augusto Corr\u00eaa-Pl 1 were most similar. The genetic dissimilarity values ranged from 0.10 to 0.59. We conclude that the ISSR markers were efficient in detecting polymorphisms in the nanche accessions, and that it is possible to infer the genetic variability among accessions of the collection.

Adjusting for multiple pro-breastfeeding hospital practices and maternal and infant demographic characteristics, pacifier exposure during the birth hospitalization was independently associated with decreased odds of breastfeeding \u226510 weeks (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]) 0.71, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.63-0.80, p\u2009<\u20090.0001) and exclusive breastfeeding \u226510 weeks (aOR 0.70, 95% CI 0.63-0.79, p\u2009<\u20090.0001) among infants admitted to the well-baby nursery, but not among those admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).\nCONCLUSIONS: In this population study of mothers from 10 U.S. states, pacifier use during the birth hospitalization was associated with decreased odds of breastfeeding and exclusive breastfeeding \u226510 weeks among well-newborn, but not NICU-admitted infants. Pacifier use may be a marker rather than a cause of breastfeeding difficulties, but prospective, randomized studies are needed to help clarify this.

Oxylipins could provide a new target in the developmental origins model or the ability of early life exposure to change biology.\nOBJECTIVES: We studied the association between in utero PM<sub>2.5</sub> (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter &lt; 2.5 \u03bcm) exposure and oxylipin profiles in newborns.\nMETHODS: Thirty-seven oxylipins reflecting the cyclooxygenase (COX), lipoxygenase (5-LOX and 12/15-LOX), and cytochrome P450 (CYP) pathways were assayed in 197 cord blood plasma samples from the ENVIRONAGE birth cohort. Principal component (PC) analysis and multiple regression models were used to estimate associations of in utero PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure with oxylipin pathways and individual metabolites.\nRESULTS: A principal component representing the 5-LOX pathway (6 metabolites) was significantly positively associated with PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure during the entire (multiple testing-adjusted q-value = 0.05) and second trimester of pregnancy (q = 0.05). A principal component representing the 12/15-LOX pathway (11 metabolites) was positively associated with PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure during the second trimester of pregnancy (q = 0.05). PM<sub>2.5</sub> was not significantly associated with the COX pathway during any time period. There was a positive but nonsignificant association between second-trimester PM<sub>2.5</sub> and the CYP pathway (q = 0.16).\nCONCLUSION: In utero exposure to particulate matter, particularly during the second trimester, was associated with differences in the cord blood levels of metabolites derived from the lipoxygenase pathways. These differences may indicate an effect of air pollution during in utero life on the inflammatory state of the newborn at birth.

We investigated the abundance of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) before and after treatment in five wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) located in different areas of the Monastir Governorate (Tunisia). Three of these WWTPs (Frina, Sahline and Zaouiet) use a conventional activated sludge process as secondary treatment, whereas the WWTP located in Beni Hassen applies an ultraviolet disinfection step after the activated sludge process and the WWTP located in Moknine treats wastewater using naturally aerated lagoons as a secondary treatment process. The abundance of six ARGs (bla<sub>CTX-M</sub>, bla<sub>TEM</sub>, qnrA, qnrS, sul I and ermB) and the class 1 integron-integrase gene (intI1) were determined by quantitative PCR. All ARGs and the intI1 gene were detected in the wastewater samples, except the bla<sub>CTX-M</sub> gene, which was not detected in both influent and effluent samples from Sahline and Beni Hassen WWTPs, and the qnrS gene, which was not detected neither in the WWTP influent in Moknine nor in the WWTP effluent in Beni Hassen. Although the relative concentration of ARGs was generally found to be similar between samples collected before and after the wastewater treatment, the abundance of bla<sub>CTX-M</sub>, bla<sub>TEM</sub>, and qnrS genes was higher in the effluent of the Frina WWTP which, unlike other WWTPs, not only receives domestic or industrial sewage but also untreated hospital waste. To the best of our knowledge, this study quantified for the first time the abundance of ARGs in different Tunisian WWTPs, and the results agree with previous studies suggesting that conventional wastewater treatment does not efficiently reduce ARGs. Therefore, these findings could be useful to improve the design or operation of WWTPs.",

New omics platforms can detect these perturbations, but translating the diverse molecular and statistical information into testable mechanistic hypotheses is challenging. Therefore, we set out to create a public tool that integrates these data across multiple datasets, platforms, study designs and species in order to detect the most promising targets for further mechanistic studies.\nRESULTS: We developed Mergeomics, a computational pipeline consisting of independent modules that 1) leverage multi-omics association data to identify biological processes that are perturbed in disease, and 2) overlay the disease-associated processes onto molecular interaction networks to pinpoint hubs as potential key regulators. Unlike existing tools that are mostly dedicated to specific data type or settings, the Mergeomics pipeline accepts and integrates datasets across platforms, data types and species. We optimized and evaluated the performance of Mergeomics using simulation and multiple independent datasets, and benchmarked the results against alternative methods. We also demonstrate the versatility of Mergeomics in two case studies that include genome-wide, epigenome-wide and transcriptome-wide datasets from human and mouse studies of total cholesterol and fasting glucose. In both cases, the Mergeomics pipeline provided statistical and contextual evidence to prioritize further investigations in the wet lab. The software implementation of Mergeomics is freely available as a Bioconductor R package.\nCONCLUSION: Mergeomics is a flexible and robust computational pipeline for multidimensional data integration.

However, a common problem with these methods is their time consumption, especially when measuring the gene functional similarities of a large number of gene pairs. The problem of computational efficiency for pairwise approaches is even more prominent because they are dependent on the combination of semantic similarity. Therefore, the efficient measurement of gene functional similarity remains a challenging problem.\nRESULTS: To speed current gene functional similarity calculation methods, a novel two-step computing strategy is proposed: (1) establish a hash table for each method to store essential information obtained from the Gene Ontology (GO) graph and (2) measure gene functional similarity based on the corresponding hash table. There is no need to traverse the GO graph repeatedly for each method with the help of the hash table. The analysis of time complexity shows that the computational efficiency of these methods is significantly improved. We also implement a novel Speeding Gene Functional Similarity Calculation tool, namely SGFSC, which is bundled with seven typical measures using our proposed strategy. Further experiments show the great advantage of SGFSC in measuring gene functional similarity on the whole genomic scale.\nCONCLUSIONS: The proposed strategy is successful in speeding current gene functional similarity calculation methods. SGFSC is an efficient tool that is freely available at http://nclab.hit.edu.cn/SGFSC . The source code of SGFSC can be downloaded from http://pan.baidu.com/s/1dFFmvpZ .",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: ChIP-nexus, an extension of the ChIP-exo protocol, can be used to map the borders of protein-bound DNA sequences at nucleotide resolution, requires less input DNA and enables selective PCR duplicate removal using random barcodes. However, the use of random barcodes requires additional preprocessing of the mapping data, which complicates the computational analysis. To date, only a very limited number of software packages are available for the analysis of ChIP-exo data, which have not yet been systematically tested and compared on ChIP-nexus data.\nRESULTS: Here, we present a comprehensive software package for ChIP-nexus data that exploits the random barcodes for selective removal of PCR duplicates and for quality control. Furthermore, we developed bespoke methods to estimate the width of the protected region resulting from protein-DNA binding and to infer binding positions from ChIP-nexus data. Finally, we applied our peak calling method as well as the two other methods MACE and MACS2 to the available ChIP-nexus data.\nCONCLUSIONS: The Q-nexus software is efficient and easy to use. Novel statistics about duplication rates in consideration of random barcodes are calculated. Our method for the estimation of the width of the protected region yields unbiased signatures that are highly reproducible for biological replicates and at the same time very specific for the respective factors analyzed. As judged by the irreproducible discovery rate (IDR), our peak calling algorithm shows a substantially better reproducibility.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The developmental cycle of Dictyostelid amoebae represents an early form of multicellularity with cell type differentiation. Mutant studies in the model Dictyostelium discoideum revealed that its developmental program integrates the actions of genes involved in signal transduction, adhesion, motility, autophagy and cell wall and matrix biosynthesis. However, due to functional redundancy and fail safe options not required in the laboratory, this single organism approach cannot capture all essential genes. To understand how multicellular organisms evolved, it is essential to recognize both the conserved core features of their developmental programs and the gene modifications that instigated phenotypic innovation. For complex organisms, such as animals, this is not within easy reach, but it is feasible for less complex forms, such as the Dictyostelid social amoebas.\nRESULTS: We compared global profiles of gene expression during the development of four social amoebae species that represent 600 mya of Dictyostelia evolution, and identified orthologous conserved genes with similar developmental up-regulation of expression using three different methods. For validation, we disrupted five genes of this core set and examined the phenotypic consequences.\nCONCLUSION: At least 71 of the developmentally regulated genes that were identified with all methods were likely to be already present in the last ancestor of all Dictyostelia. The lack of phenotypic changes in null mutants indicates that even highly conserved genes either participate in functionally redundant pathways or are necessary for developmental progression under adverse, non-standard laboratory conditions. Both mechanisms provide robustness to the developmental program, but impose a limit on the information that can be obtained from deleting single genes.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Maternal metabolism during pregnancy is a major determinant of the intra-uterine environment and fetal outcomes. Herein, we characterize the maternal urinary metabolome throughout pregnancy to identify maternal metabolic signatures of fetal growth in two subcohorts and explain potential sources of variation in metabolic profiles based on lifestyle and clinical data.\nMETHODS: We used 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to characterize maternal urine samples collected in the INMA birth cohort at the first (n\u2009=\u2009412 and n\u2009=\u2009394, respectively, in Gipuzkoa and Sabadell cohorts) and third trimesters of gestation (n\u2009=\u2009417 and 469). Metabolic phenotypes that reflected longitudinal intra- and inter-individual variation were used to predict measures of fetal growth and birth weight.\nRESULTS: A metabolic shift between the first and third trimesters of gestation was characterized by 1H NMR signals arising predominantly from steroid by-products. We identified 10 significant and reproducible metabolic associations in the third trimester with estimated fetal, birth, and placental weight in two independent subcohorts. These included branched-chain amino acids; isoleucine, valine, leucine, alanine\u00a0and 3 hydroxyisobutyrate (metabolite of valine), which were associated with a significant fetal weight increase at week 34 of up to 2.4\u00a0% in Gipuzkoa (P\u2009&lt;\u20090.005) and 1\u00a0% in Sabadell (P\u2009&lt;\u20090.05). Other metabolites included pregnancy-related hormone by-products of estrogens and progesterone, and the methyl donor choline. We could explain a total of 48-53 % of the total variance in birth weight of which urine metabolites had an independent predictive power of 12\u00a0% adjusting for all other lifestyle/clinical factors. First trimester metabolic phenotypes could not predict reproducibly weight at later stages of development. Physical activity, as well as other modifiable lifestyle/clinical factors, such as coffee consumption, vitamin D intake, and smoking, were identified as potential sources of metabolic variation during pregnancy.\nCONCLUSIONS: Significant reproducible maternal urinary metabolic signatures of fetal growth and birth weight are identified for the first time and linked to modifiable lifestyle factors. This novel approach to prenatal screening, combining multiple risk factors, present a great opportunity to personalize pregnancy management and reduce newborn disease risk in later life.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Allergic rhinitis is regarded as an imbalanced Th1/Th2 cell-mediated response. The present study used microarray analysis to compare gene expression levels between allergic rhinitis patients before and after a series of acupoint herbal plaster applications.\nMETHODS: In this experimental pilot study, volunteers experiencing sneezing, runny nose, and congestion for more than 9\u00a0months in the year following initial diagnoses were included after diagnostic confirmation by otolaryngologists to exclude patients with sinusitis and nasal polyps. Patients with persistent allergic rhinitis each received four acupoint herbal plaster treatments applied using the moxibustion technique. Clinical outcomes were evaluated using the Rhinitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ). Peripheral blood samples were analyzed using an ImmunoCAP Phadiatop test, and patients were classified as phadiatop (Ph)-positive or -negative. Microarray results were analyzed for genes that were differentially expressed between (1) Ph-positive and -negative patients treated with herbal plaster; and (2) before and after herbal plaster treatment in the Ph-positive patient group. Unsupervised and supervised methods were used for gene-expression data analysis.\nRESULTS: Nineteen Ph-positive and four Ph-negative participants with persistent allergic rhinitis were included in the study. RQLQ results indicated that the 19 Ph-positive volunteers experienced improvement in six of seven categories following acupoint herbal plaster treatments, whereas the four Ph-negative participants reported improvement in only two categories. Hierarchical clustering and principle component analysis of the gene expression profiles of Ph-positive and -negative participants indicated the groups exhibited distinct physiological responses to acupoint herbal treatment. Evaluation of gene networks using MetaCore identified that the \"Immune response_IL-13 signaling via JAK-STAT\" and the \"Inflammation_Interferon signaling\" were down- and up-regulated, respectively, among Ph-positive subjects.\nCONCLUSIONS: In this preliminary study, we find that the IL-13 immune response via JAK-STAT signaling and interferon inflammation signaling were down- and upregulated, respectively, in the Ph-positive group. Further studies are required to verify these pathways in Ph-positive patients, and to determine the mechanism of such pathway dysregulation.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02486159 .

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Perinatal depression (PND) has an overall estimated prevalence of roughly 12\u00a0%. Untreated PND has significant negative consequences not only on the health of the mothers, but also on the physical, emotional and cognitive development of their children. No certain risk factors are known to predict PND and no completely safe drug treatments are available during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Sleep and depression are strongly related to each other because of a solid reciprocal causal relationship. Bright light therapy (BLT) is a well-tested and safe treatment, effective in both depression and circadian/sleep disorders.\nMETHODS: In a 3-year longitudinal, observational, multicentre study, about 500 women will be recruited and followed-up from early pregnancy (10-15 gestational week) until 12\u00a0months after delivery. The primary aim of the present study is to systematically explore and characterize risk factors for PND by prospective sleep assessment (using wrist actigraphy, polysomnography and various sleep questionnaires) and bloodbased analysis of potential markers during the perinatal period (Life-ON study). Secondary aims are to explore the relationship between specific genetic polymorphisms and PND (substudy Life-ON1), to investigate the effectiveness of BLT in treating PND (substudy Life-ON2) and to test whether a short term trial of BLT during pregnancy can prevent PND (substudy Life-ON3).\nDISCUSSION: The characterization of specific predictive and risk factors for PND may substantially contribute to improve preventive medical and social strategies for the affected women. The study results are expected to promote a better understanding of the relationship between sleep disorders and the development of PND and to confirm, in a large sample of women, the safety and efficacy of BLT both in prevention and treatment of PND.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02664467 .

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease that involves the death of neurons. ALS is associated with many gene mutations as previously studied. In order to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying ALS with C9orf72 mutation, gene expression profiles of ALS fibroblasts and control fibroblasts were subjected to bioinformatics analysis. Genes with critical functional roles can be detected by a measure of node centrality in biological networks. In gene co-expression networks, highly connected genes called as candidate hubs have been associated with key disease-related pathways. Herein, this method was applied to find the hub genes related to ALS disease.\nMETHODS: Illumina HiSeq microarray gene expression dataset GSE51684 was retrieved from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database which included four Sporadic ALS, twelve Familial ALS and eight control samples. Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) were identified using the Student's t test statistical method and gene co-expression networking. Gene ontology (GO) function and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of DEGs were performed using the DAVID online tool. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were constructed by mapping the DEGs onto protein-protein interaction data from publicly available databases to identify the pathways where DEGs are involved in. PPI interaction network was divided into subnetworks using MCODE algorithm and was analyzed using Cytoscape.\nRESULTS: The results revealed that the expression of DEGs was mainly involved in cell adhesion, cell-cell signaling, Extra cellular matrix region GO processes and focal adhesion, neuroactive ligand receptor interaction, Extracellular matrix receptor interaction. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF), Endothelin 1 (EDN1), Angiotensin (AGT) and many cell adhesion molecules (CAM) were detected as hub genes that can be targeted as novel therapeutic targets for ALS disease.\nCONCLUSION: These analyses and findings enhance the understanding of ALS pathogenesis and provide references for ALS therapy.",

It is likely that the GWAS signal originates from one or many as yet unidentified causal variants.\nMETHODS: Using next-generation sequencing, we characterized 12 breast cancer susceptibility regions identified by GWASs in 2288 breast cancer cases and 2323 controls across four populations of African American, European, Japanese, and Hispanic ancestry.\nRESULTS: After genotype calling and quality control, we identified 137,530 single-nucleotide variants (SNVs); of those, 87.2\u00a0% had a minor allele frequency (MAF) <0.005. For SNVs with MAF >0.005, we calculated the smallest number of SNVs needed to obtain a posterior probability set (PPS) such that there is 90\u00a0% probability that the causal SNV is included. We found that the PPS for two regions, 2q35 and 11q13, contained less than 5\u00a0% of the original SNVs, dramatically decreasing the number of potentially causal SNVs. However, we did not find strong evidence supporting a causal role for any individual SNV. In addition, there were no significant gene-based rare SNV associations after correcting for multiple testing.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study illustrates some of the challenges faced in fine-mapping studies in the post-GWAS era, most importantly the large sample sizes needed to identify rare-variant associations or to distinguish the effects of strongly correlated common SNVs.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy with 3+ doses of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (IPTp-SP) reduces maternal mortality and stillbirths in malaria endemic areas. Between December 2014 and December 2015, a project to scale up IPTp-SP to all pregnant women was implemented in three local government areas (LGA) of Sokoto State, Nigeria. The intervention included community education and mobilization, household distribution of SP, and community health information systems that reminded mothers of upcoming SP doses. Health facility IPTp-SP distribution continued in three intervention (population 661,606) and one counterfactual (population 167,971) LGAs. During the project lifespan, 31,493 pregnant women were eligible for at least one dose of IPTp-SP.\nMETHODS: Community and facility data on IPTp-SP distribution were collected in all four LGAs. Data from a subset of 9427 pregnant women, who were followed through 42\u00a0days postpartum, were analysed to assess associations between SP dosages and newborn status. Nominal cost and expense data in 2015 Nigerian Naira were obtained from expenditure records on the distribution of SP.\nRESULTS: Eighty-two percent (n\u00a0=\u00a025,841) of eligible women received one or more doses of IPTp-SP. The SP1 coverage was 95% in the intervention LGAs; 26% in the counterfactual. Measurable SP3+ coverage was 45% in the intervention and 0% in the counterfactual LGAs. The mean number of SP doses in the intervention LGAs was 2.1; 0.4 in the counterfactual. Increased doses of IPTp-SP were associated with linear increases in newborn head circumference and lower odds of stillbirth. Any antenatal care utilization predicted larger newborn head circumference and lower odds of stillbirth. The cost of delivering three doses of SP, inclusive of the cost of medicines, was US$0.93-$1.20.\nCONCLUSIONS: It is feasible, safe, and affordable to scale up the delivery of high impact IPTp-SP interventions in low resource malaria endemic settings, where few women access facility-based maternal health services.

The authors provided direct, interactive education to lay audiences and measured these sessions' impact on anxiety and any increased understanding of breast cancer screening.\nMETHODS: Academic breast radiologist provided seven 1-hour sessions of structured lectures and question-and-answer periods. Lay language and radiologic images were used to discuss disease background, screening guidelines, and areas of debate. One hundred seventeen participants (mean age, 45 \u00b1 15 years) completed voluntary, anonymous, institutional review board-approved pre and postsession questionnaires relaying their attitudes regarding screening and the impact of the sessions. Results are summarized descriptively.\nRESULTS: Mean reported anxiety regarding screening (on a scale ranging from 1-5; 1\u00a0= no anxiety) was 2.5 \u00b1 1.3. Anxiety was attributed to unknown results (56.4%), anticipation of pain (21.8%), known risk factors (14.5%), general uncertainty (12.7%), waiting for results (9.1%), possibility of more procedures (3.6%), and personal breast cancer history (3.6%). Ninety-seven percent reported that immediate results would lower anxiety (78% of those women indicated a 75%-100% decrease in anxiety); 93% reported that radiologist consultation with images would lower anxiety (75.6% indicated a 75%-100% decrease in anxiety). After the lecture, women reported (on a scale ranging from 1-5) increased understanding of the topic (4.7 \u00b1 0.6), encouragement to screen (4.6 \u00b1 0.7), and reduced anxiety (4.0 \u00b1 1.1). Ninety-seven percent to 100% provided correct responses to these questions: rationale for screening in the absence of family history, recall does not equate to cancer diagnosis, benefit of prior films, and continued importance of physical examination.\nCONCLUSION: Attendees of radiologist-provided direct public lectures reported decreased anxiety and improved knowledge regarding screening mammography. The resultant reduced anxiety (\"harm\") and educational empowerment help enable informed decision making and may promote screening attendance.",

        "abstract": "Surgery has always played a central role in the management of breast cancer, with local control via complete tumour resection long established as the cornerstone of effective breast cancer therapy. While extensive surgical resection in the form of the Halstead radical mastectomy dominated treatment up until at least the 1970s, the advent of adjuvant loco-regional and systemic therapies has resulted in a decrease in the magnitude of surgical intervention in recent decades. The Biomolecular or \"-omics\" era initiated with the discovery of the DNA double helix in 1953 and intensified by the completion of the human genome project in 2003 has seen an unprecedented expansion in our understanding of the molecular and genetic heterogeneity of cancer. This review will discuss how the clinical application of this knowledge in the direction of personalised risk assessment and breast cancer treatment has significant implications for modern surgical practice.",

        "abstract": "Somatic mutations in TP53 and NRAS are associated with transformation of human chronic myeloid diseases to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Here, we report that concurrent RAS pathway and TP53 mutations are identified in a subset of AML patients and confer an inferior overall survival. To further investigate the genetic interaction between p53 loss and endogenous NrasG12D/+ in AML, we generated conditional NrasG12D/+p53-/- mice. Consistent with the clinical data, recipient mice transplanted with NrasG12D/+p53-/- bone marrow cells rapidly develop a highly penetrant AML. We find that p53-/- cooperates with NrasG12D/+ to promote increased quiescence in megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors (MEPs). NrasG12D/+p53-/- MEPs are transformed to self-renewing AML-initiating cells and are capable of inducing AML in serially transplanted recipients. RNA sequencing analysis revealed that transformed MEPs gain a partial hematopoietic stem cell signature and largely retain an MEP signature. Their distinct transcriptomes suggests a potential regulation by p53 loss. In addition, we show that during AML development, transformed MEPs acquire overexpression of oncogenic Nras, leading to hyperactivation of ERK1/2 signaling. Our results demonstrate that p53-/- synergizes with enhanced oncogenic Nras signaling to transform MEPs and drive AML development. This model may serve as a platform to test candidate therapeutics in this aggressive subset of AML.",

        "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Some life-threatening, foodborne, and zoonotic infections are transmitted through poultry birds. Inappropriate and indiscriminate use of antimicrobials in the livestock industry has led to an increased prevalence of multidrug-resistant bacteria with epidemic potential. Here, we present a functional molecular epidemiological analysis entailing the phenotypic and whole-genome sequence-based characterization of 11 H. pullorum isolates from broiler and free-range chickens sampled from retail wet markets in Hyderabad City, India. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests revealed all of the isolates to be resistant to multiple antibiotic classes such as fluoroquinolones, cephalosporins, sulfonamides, and macrolides. The isolates were also found to be extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamase producers and were even resistant to clavulanic acid. Whole-genome sequencing and comparative genomic analysis of these isolates revealed the presence of five or six well-characterized antimicrobial resistance genes, including those encoding a resistance-nodulation-division efflux pump(s). Phylogenetic analysis combined with pan-genome analysis revealed a remarkable degree of genetic diversity among the isolates from free-range chickens; in contrast, a high degree of genetic similarity was observed among broiler chicken isolates. Comparative genomic analysis of all publicly available H. pullorum genomes, including our isolates (n = 16), together with the genomes of 17 other Helicobacter species, revealed a high number (8,560) of H. pullorum-specific protein-encoding genes, with an average of 535 such genes per isolate. In silico virulence screening identified 182 important virulence genes and also revealed high strain-specific gene content in isolates from free-range chickens (average, 34) compared to broiler chicken isolates. A significant prevalence of prophages (ranging from 1 to 9) and a significant presence of genomic islands (0 to 4) were observed in free-range and broiler chicken isolates. Taken together, these observations provide significant baseline data for functional molecular infection epidemiology of nonpyloric Helicobacter species such as H. pullorum by unraveling their evolution in chickens and their possible zoonotic transmission to humans.\nIMPORTANCE: Globally, the poultry industry is expanding with an ever-growing consumer base for chicken meat. Given this, food-associated transmission of multidrug-resistant bacteria represents an important health care issue. Our study involves a critical baseline approach directed at genome sequence-based epidemiology and transmission dynamics of H. pullorum, a poultry pathogen having established zoonotic potential. We believe our studies would facilitate the development of surveillance systems that ensure the safety of food for humans and guide public health policies related to the use of antibiotics in animal feed in countries such as India. We sequenced 11 new genomes of H. pullorum as a part of this study. These genomes would provide much value in addition to the ongoing comparative genomic studies of helicobacters.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy is an important tool for controlling enterovirus infections, but clinically effective anti-enterovirus drugs do not currently exist, mainly due to the development of drug resistance. We investigated the combination effects of enterovirus replication inhibitors in order to limit this process. In previous studies, we showed the efficacy of consecutive alternating administration of the triple combinations disoxaril/guanidine/oxoglaucine and pleconaril/guanidine/oxoglaucine against coxsackievirus B1 infection in newborn mice. Drug sensitivity tests of the viral brain isolates showed that these drug combinations prevented the development of drug resistance.\nMETHODS: In the current study, we replaced guanidine-HCl with enteroviral RNA synthesis inhibitor MDL-860 to test the effect of a new triple combination-pleconaril/MDL-860/oxoglaucine-applied via consecutive alternating administration in newborn mice infected subcutaneously with 20 MLD<sub>50</sub> of coxsackievirus B1.\nRESULTS: The pleconaril/MDL-860/oxoglaucine combination via consecutive alternating administration showed high activity at the 75\u2009mg/kg MDL-860 dose: a protective effect of 50% and a pronounced suppression of brain virus titers. Moreover, along with prevention of drug resistance, a phenomenon of increased drug sensitivity was established. MDL-860 sensitivity in pleconaril/MDL-860/oxoglaucine increased 8.2 times vs. placebo (29 times vs. monotherapy) on day 7 and oxoglaucine sensitivity-4.9 times vs. placebo (by 6.8 times vs. monotherapy) on day 13. As concerns pleconaril, a demonstrable prevention of drug resistance was registered without increase of drug sensitivity. Daily, simultaneous administration of pleconaril/MDL-860/oxoglaucine showed no protective effects and led to a rapid development of drug resistance.\nCONCLUSIONS: These results add new support for using consecutive alternating administration treatment courses to achieve clinically effective chemotherapy of enterovirus infections.",

Although knowledge about the current guidelines and radiation protection devices is a pre-requisite for the use of radiation, the preventive measures are often more or less strictly followed, leading to chronic daily exposure to significant doses of radiation and large accumulated lifetime exposures. Aortic intervention, electrophysiology, and neuro intervention in particular can result in large doses to the operators. Interventionalists might try to rationalize their dismissal of the exposure risks with various excuses: they don't know where they left their badges (even though, guiltily, they would readily admit it is good practice to always wear them), the estimated short duration of the procedure, significant muscular strain and spasm caused by the heaviness of lead aprons, decreased dexterity with lead gloves, or discomfort in wearing lead protective glasses. But their dismissive attitude is most likely due to the inherent inability to feel threatened by something they cannot see or feel, a commitment to the patient at all cost, and a culture of bravado that reinforces their behavior.",

Smokers vary widely in their rate of inactivation and clearance of nicotine, altering numerous smoking phenotypes. We aimed to characterize independent and shared impact of genetic and nongenetic sources of variation in CYP2A6 mRNA, protein, and enzyme activity in a human liver bank (n = 360). For the assessment of genetic factors, we quantified levels of CYP2A6, cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (POR), and aldo-keto reductase 1D1 (AKR1D1) mRNA, and CYP2A6 and POR proteins. CYP2A6 enzyme activity was determined through measurement of cotinine formation from nicotine and 7-hydroxycoumarin formation from coumarin. Donor DNA was genotyped for CYP2A6, POR, and AKR1D1 genetic variants. Nongenetic factors assessed included gender, age, and liver disease. CYP2A6 phenotype measures were positively correlated to each other (r values ranging from 0.47-0.88, P < 0.001). Female donors exhibited higher CYP2A6 mRNA expression relative to males (P < 0.05). Donor age was weakly positively correlated with CYP2A6 protein (r = 0.12, P < 0.05) and activity (r = 0.20, P < 0.001). CYP2A6 reduced-function genotypes, but not POR or AKR1D1 genotypes, were associated with lower CYP2A6 protein (P < 0.001) and activity (P < 0.01). AKR1D1 mRNA was correlated with CYP2A6 mRNA (r = 0.57, P < 0.001), protein (r = 0.30, P < 0.001), and activity (r = 0.34, P < 0.001). POR protein was correlated with CYP2A6 activity (r = 0.45, P < 0.001). Through regression analyses, we accounted for 17% (P < 0.001), 37% (P < 0.001), and 77% (P < 0.001) of the variation in CYP2A6 mRNA, protein, and activity, respectively. Overall, several independent and shared sources of variation in CYP2A6 activity in vitro have been identified, which could translate to variable hepatic clearance of nicotine.",

We evaluated the impact of the program impact on HPV prevalence in unvaccinated male subjects.\nMETHODS: Sexually active heterosexual male subjects aged 16-35 years were recruited in 2014-2016. Participants provided a self-collected penile swab sample for HPV genotyping (Roche Linear Array) and completed a demographic and risk factor questionnaire.\nRESULTS: The prevalence of 4vHPV genotypes among 511 unvaccinated male subjects was significantly lower in those aged \u226425 than in those aged >25 years: 3.1% (95% confidence interval, 1.5%-5.7%) versus 13.7% (8.9%-20.1%), respectively (P < .001); adjusted prevalence ratio, 0.22 (.09-.51; P < .001). By contrast, the prevalence of high-risk HPV genotypes other than 16 and 18 remained the same across age groups: 16.8% (95% confidence interval, 12.6%-21.9%) in men aged \u226425 years and 17.9% (12.4%-25.0%) in those aged >25 years (P = .76); adjusted prevalence ratio, 0.98, (.57-1.37; P = .58).\nCONCLUSIONS: A 78% lower prevalence of 4vHPV genotypes was observed among younger male subjects. These data suggest that unvaccinated men may have benefited from herd protection as much as women from a female-only HPV vaccination program with high coverage.",

        "abstract": "Mice and humans branched from a common ancestor approximately 80 million years ago.

While this has led to breakthroughs in the understanding of genotype-phenotype relationships and in the identification of therapeutic targets, translation of beneficial responses to therapeutics from mice to humans has not always been successful. In a large part, these differences may be attributed to variations in the alignment of protein expression and signaling in the immune systems between mice and humans. Well-established inbred strains of \"The Laboratory Mouse\" vary in their immune response patterns as a result of genetic mutations and polymorphisms arising from intentional selection for research relevant traits, and even closely related substrains vary in their immune response patterns as a result of genetic mutations and polymorphisms arising from genetic drift.

Also in breast cancer, the most commonly diagnosed malignancy in women, this heterogeneity complicates the understanding of the stepwise sequence of pathogenic events and the design of effective and long-lasting target therapies. To disentangle this complexity and pinpoint which molecular perturbations are crucial to hijack the cellular machinery and lead to tumorigenesis and drug resistance, functional studies are needed in model systems that faithfully and comprehensively recapitulate all the salient aspects of their cognate human counterparts. Mouse models of breast cancer have been instrumental for the study of tumor initiation and drug response but also involve cost and time limitations that represent serious bottlenecks in translational research. To keep pace with the overwhelming amount of hypotheses that warrant in vivo testing, continuous refinement of current breast cancer models and implementation of new technologies is crucial.

        "abstract": "Hypertension (high blood pressure) is a major public health problem affecting more than a billion people worldwide with complications, including stroke, heart failure and kidney failure. The regulation of blood pressure is multifactorial reflecting genetic susceptibility, in utero environment and external factors such as obesity and salt intake. In keeping with Arthur Guyton's hypothesis, the kidney plays a key role in blood pressure control and data from clinical studies; physiology and genetics have shown that hypertension is driven a failure of the kidney to excrete excess salt at normal levels of blood pressure. There is a number of rare Mendelian blood pressure syndromes, which have shed light on the molecular mechanisms involved in dysregulated ion transport in the distal kidney. One in particular is Familial hyperkalemic hypertension (FHHt), an autosomal dominant monogenic form of hypertension characterised by high blood pressure, hyperkalemia, hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, and hypercalciuria. The clinical signs of FHHt are treated by low doses of thiazide diuretic, and it mirrors Gitelman syndrome which features the inverse phenotype of hypotension, hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis, and hypocalciuria. Gitelman syndrome is caused by loss of function mutations in the thiazide-sensitive Na/Cl cotransporter (NCC); however, FHHt patients do not have mutations in the SCL12A3 locus encoding NCC. Instead, mutations have been identified in genes that have revealed a key signalling pathway that regulates NCC and several other key transporters and ion channels in the kidney that are critical for BP regulation.

Tumors were segmented using a semiautomated software-based tool. Tumors were classified as superficial or deep and discrete or plexiform. Segmentation times were recorded. Segmentation yielded the quantity and tumor burden of superficial, internal and plexiform tumors. Correlations between segmentation data and demographic, disease-related and anthropomorphic features were examined.\nRESULTS: Fifteen patients were evaluated (42.3 \u00b1 13.6\u00a0years, 10 female, 5 male). Segmentation times were a median of 30\u00a0min and yielded 2,328 tumors (1,582 superficial, 746 internal and 23 plexiform). One tumor was malignant. Tumor counts ranged from 14 to 397. Tumor burden ranged from 6.95\u00a0cm3 to 571\u00a0cm3. Individual tumor volume ranged from 0.0120\u00a0cm3 to 298\u00a0cm3.

Epigenome-wide studies have reported variation in methylation patterns between populations, including Caucasians, non-Caucasians (Blacks), Hispanics, Arabs, and numerous populations of the African continent. Not only has DNA methylation differences shown to impact externally visible characteristics, but is also a potential biomarker for underlying racial health disparities between human populations. Ethnicity-related methylation differences set their mark during early embryonic development. Genetic variations, such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms and environmental factors, such as age, dietary folate, socioeconomic status, and smoking, impacts DNA methylation levels, which reciprocally impacts expression of phenotypes. Studies show that it is necessary to address these external influences when attempting to differentiate between populations since the relative impacts of these factors on the human methylome remain uncertain. The present review summarises several reported attempts to establish the contribution of differential DNA methylation to natural human variation, and shows that DNA methylation could represent new opportunities for risk stratification and prevention of several diseases amongst populations world-wide. Variation of methylation patterns between human populations is an exciting prospect which inspires further valuable research to apply the concept in routine medical and forensic casework. However, trans-generational inheritance needs to be quantified to decipher the proportion of variation contributed by DNA methylation. The future holds thorough evaluation of the epigenome to understand quantification, heritability, and the effect of DNA methylation on phenotypes. In addition, methylation profiling of the same ethnic groups across geographical locations will shed light on conserved methylation differences in populations.",

Learning and social problems are more prevalent among individuals affected with NF1. It has been reported that people with NF1 have lower self-esteem (SE) when compared to the general population. Additionally, a study published over 20\u00a0years ago found that overall knowledge of NF1 was lacking in individuals affected with the condition. The goals of our study were to evaluate NF1 knowledge in adolescents and adults with the condition, as well as to determine if there is a link between patient knowledge and SE. Furthermore, we explored the impact of other factors, such as attendance at a NF1 support group and having a family history of NF1, on knowledge and SE. A survey comprised of knowledge-based questions and the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale was distributed to individuals with NF1 through the Texas NF Foundation.

The mTOR pathway has become an exciting treatment target for these various disorders, with mTOR inhibitors such as rapamycin being studied for their potential therapeutic applications. In particular, tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a genetic disorder resulting from overactivation of the mTOR pathway, and pharmacologic therapy with mTOR inhibitors has emerged as a viable treatment option for the systemic manifestations of the disease. In this review, we discuss the approved indications for mTOR inhibitors in TSC, the potential future applications of mTOR inhibitors in TSC and other neurological conditions, and the safety considerations applicable to mTOR therapy in the pediatric population.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Patients diagnosed with invasive breast cancer (BC) or ductal carcinoma in situ are increasingly choosing to undergo contralateral prophylactic mastectomy (CPM) to reduce their risk of contralateral BC (CBC). This is a particularly disturbing trend as a large proportion of these CPMs are believed to be medically unnecessary. Many BC patients tend to substantially overestimate their CBC risk. Thus, there is a pressing need to educate patients effectively on their CBC risk. We develop a CBC risk prediction model to aid physicians in this task.\nMETHODS: We used data from two sources: Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium and Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results to build the model. The model building steps are similar to those used in developing the BC risk assessment tool (popularly known as Gail model) for counseling women on their BC risk. Our model, named CBCRisk, is exclusively designed for counseling women diagnosed with unilateral BC on the risk of developing CBC.\nRESULTS: We identified eight factors to be significantly associated with CBC-age at first BC diagnosis, anti-estrogen therapy, family history of BC, high-risk pre-neoplasia\u00a0status, estrogen receptor status, breast density, type of first BC, and age at first birth. Combining the relative risk estimates with the relevant hazard rates, CBCRisk projects absolute risk of developing CBC over a given period.\nCONCLUSIONS: By providing individualized CBC risk estimates, CBCRisk may help in counseling of BC patients. In turn, this may potentially help alleviate the rate of medically unnecessary CPMs.",

Following fertilization, each of the embryos were biopsied in the cleavage stage and subsequently processed for whole-genome amplification. Genetic status of the embryos was diagnosed by linkage analysis and direct mutation testing using primer extension-based mini-sequencing. Comprehensive chromosomal aneuploidy screening was performed using a next-generation sequencing-based strategy.\nRESULTS: Only a single cycle of ICSI-IVF was processed. There were seven embryos from this couple-two were likely affected, three were likely carriers, one was likely unaffected, and one failed in target genome amplification. Aneuploidy screening was performed before making a decision on embryo transfer, and only one unaffected embryo passed the screening. That embryo was transferred in a frozen thawed cycle, and the pregnancy was successful. The diagnosis was confirmed by amniocentesis, which presented with a result consistent with PGD. At 38\u00a0weeks of gestational age, a healthy male baby was born. Postnatal genetic confirmation was also consistent with PGD and the prenatal results. At the age of 24\u00a0months, the baby presented with normal growth and development lacking any neurological symptoms.\nCONCLUSIONS: We report the first successful trial of PGD for PKAN in a developing country using linkage analysis and mini-sequencing in cleavage stage embryos.",

        "abstract": "The notion that gene expression signatures in blood can serve as biomarkers of disease states is not new. In the case of atherosclerosis, and coronary artery disease in particular, whether changes in gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells reflects disease processes occurring in the vessel wall remains controversial. When comparing 15 studies that identified 706 differentially expressed genes, only 23 genes were replicated in 2 to 3 studies, at most. This low level of replication may reflect sample sizes too small to overcome heterogeneity in the response to disease. Genetic differences affect how each person responds to disease and what genes are altered. Recent studies with larger cohorts (over 5000 individuals) that considered the effect of common genetic variants still could not claim disease signature genes as biomarkers suggesting that even larger case-control studies will be required to achieve the required statistical power. On the other hand, out of 7 studies that identified 58 microRNAs, 12 were concordant in 2 or more studies, suggesting that microRNAs may be less affected by genetic differences and more accurately reflect the disease process.

Only one third of these variants mediate their risk through known conventional risk factors for CAD. Thus, unknown mechanisms contribute to CAD. Secondly, the genetic risk is proportional to the total number of risk variants rather than the intensity of any risk factor. Thirdly, the availability of the genetic risk variants enables one to perform Mendelian randomization (MR) studies since they are randomized at conception, not confounded, fixed for life, and can be used to determine if a risk factor is causative or just a marker. MR can also be used to determine the safety and efficacy of a gene product targeted for drug therapy. Genetic risk variants have been shown to successfully risk stratify for CAD in both primary and secondary preventions. Contrary to dogma, MR documents that plasma HDL-C is not protective of CAD. The use of genetic risk score (GRS) for CAD is shown to be more effective in risk stratifying for CAD than the Framingham risk score and independent of the conventional risk factors including family history. Furthermore, the GRS predicts the response to statin therapy in primary and secondary preventions. The use of GRS could represent a paradigm shift in the prevention of CAD.",

Among them, the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) prevents the occurrence of abnormal divisions by halting the metaphase to anaphase transition following the detection of erroneous microtubules-kinetochore attachment(s). Most synchronization strategies are based on the activation of cell cycle checkpoints to enrich the population of cells in a specific phase of the cell cycle. Here, we develop a two-step protocol of sequential cell synchronization and desynchronization employing antimitotic SAC-inducing agents (i.e., nocodazole or paclitaxel) in combination with the depletion of the SAC kinase MPS1. We describe cytofluorometric and time-lapse videomicroscopy methods to detect cell cycle progression, including the assessment of cell cycle distribution, quantification of mitotic cell fraction, and analysis of single cell fate profile of living cells. We applied these methods to validate the synchronization-desynchronization protocol and to qualitatively and quantitatively determine the impact of SAC inactivation on the activity of antimitotic agents.",

However, several issues remain when considering intracellular stainings, especially in the context of a daily routine use and in multicenter clinical research protocols including large cohorts of patients. The requirements for multiple protocol steps are not only time-consuming but also frequently associated with high cell loss and nonspecific binding or reduced fluorescence. These drawbacks make standardized intracellular flow cytometry use in multicenter studies struggling. As a consequence, intracellular flow cytometry has mostly remained a tool for experimental and clinical research. In the current chapter, we will complete flow cytometry protocols described in the previous edition by presenting novel intracellular protocols usable in clinic. These present with many advantages including shorter time-to-results, one-step whole blood procedures, lyse-no-wash-no-centrifuge protocols, improved staining quality, and lyophilized coated reagents in ready-to-use tubes. This opens novel perspectives for standardization and feasibility in clinical studies, for drug efficacy monitoring and for patients' stratification within a context of personalized medicine.

We assessed overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS), stratified by extent of surgical resection. Included in the analysis were genomic predictors of progression.\nRESULTS: Median time from surgery to start of RT was 20days for biopsy alone, 28days for subtotal resection (STR) and 28days for gross total resection (GTR). For all patients, a delay >28days did not result in a difference in PFS when compared to no delay (6.7 vs. 6.9 months, p=0.07). PFS was improved in biopsy or STR patients with a >28day delay to start of RT (4.2 vs. 6.7 months, p=0.006). OS was also improved in patients receiving biopsy or STR with a >28day delay to start of RT (12.3 vs. 7.8 months, p=0.005). Multivariable analysis (MVA) demonstrated an improvement in OS and PFS with time to RT >28days for biopsy or STR patients (HR 0.52 p=0.008 and HR 0.48 p=0.02, respectively).\nCONCLUSION: In this retrospective review of GBM patients treated at a single institution, OS and PFS were not different between time to RT >28days compared to <28 days. There was a modest improvement in both PFS and OS in patients who received biopsy or STR with time to RT >28 days.",

We sought to relate altered visual evoked potentials associated with vigabatrin intake to transcriptional changes in the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway and GABA receptors to expose further mechanisms of vigabatrin-induced visual field loss.\nMETHODS: Vigabatrin was administered to mice via an osmotic pump for two weeks to increase GABA levels. Visual evoked potentials were examined, eye samples were collected, and gene expression was measured by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Similarly, human retinal pigment epithelial cells (ARPE19) were exposed to vigabatrin and treated with mTOR inhibitors for mTOR pathway analysis\u00a0and to assess alterations in organelle accumulation by microscopy.\nRESULTS: Dysregulated expression of transcripts in the mTOR pathway, GABA<sub>A/B</sub> receptors, metabotropic glutamate (Glu)\u00a0receptors 1/6, and GABA/glutamate transporters in the eye were found in association with visual evoked potential changes during vigabatrin administration.

To determine how the BANK1 SLE-risk variants contribute to the dysregulated B cell program in lupus, we performed genotype/phenotype studies in human B cells. Targeted phospho-proteomics were used to evaluate BCR/CD40 signaling in human B cell lines engineered to express the BANK1 risk or non-risk variant proteins. We found that phosphorylation of proximal BCR signaling molecules was reduced in B cells expressing the BANK1 risk protein compared to the non-risk protein. Similar to these findings, we observed decreased B cell signaling in primary B cells from genotyped healthy control subjects carrying the BANK1 risk haplotype, including blunted BCR- and CD40-dependent AKT activation. Consistent with decreased AKT activation, we found that BANK1 risk B cells expressed increased basal levels of FOXO1 protein and increased expression of FOXO1 target genes upon stimulation compared to non-risk B cells. Healthy subjects carrying the BANK1 risk haplotype were also characterized by an expansion of memory B cells. Taken together, our results suggest that the SLE susceptibility variants in the BANK1 gene may contribute to lupus by altering B cell signaling, increasing FOXO1 levels, and enhancing memory B cell development.",

        "abstract": "Succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) is a heterotetrameric complex, among which the catalytic core SDHB loss-of-function mutations lead to mitochondrial enzyme SDH dysfunction and are associated with cancer formation. However, the impact of SDHB loss on colorectal carcinoma and the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. In this study, we found a coherent decreased SDHB expression both in human colorectal cancer (CRC) samples and CRC cell lines. Combined clinical analysis in a cohort of 43 CRC patients demonstrated a correlation between reduced SDHB activity and a more advanced clinical phenotype regarding lymphatic and distant metastasis. Applying genetic interference and cellular function approaches, we found that knocking down SDHB promoted cell migration and invasion through enabling epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and inverse results of SDHB overexpression further confirmed our theory. Mechanical exploration revealed that SDHB knockdown could activate TGF\u03b2 signaling pathway, more precisely through up-regulation of a tight-junction transcriptional repression complex SNAIL1-SMAD3/SMAD4, thus contributed to the increase in metastasis. In conclusion by identifying SNAIL1-SMAD3/SMAD4 as essential for the TGF\u03b2-mediated tumorigenic capacity in SDHB-deficient CRC cells, this study revealed a critical mechanical vulnerability for potential future therapeutic target of SDHB-associated CRC.",

        "abstract": "While numerous insect studies have demonstrated the effects environmental conditions, genetic variation and other factors have on thermal resistance, often showing patterns consistent with adaptive plasticity and local adaptation, few experiments have considered the effects of multiple factors simultaneously. Here however, we have investigated the impact of sex, rearing conditions, hardening, population, and laboratory rearing period on adult heat resistance in stocks of Drosophila hydei, a cosmopolitan species that occurs across a range of climatic zones. We show that population and putative laboratory adaptation effects are larger than those associated with rearing temperature and hardening, although there was also a notable interaction between hardening and sex, in that females showed a cost of hardening that was not present in males. In separate experiments, we found that environmental effects across a generation were small and similar in magnitude to those within a generation. These findings suggest multiple sources of variation on heat resistance and place potential genetic versus environmental sources in context.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) is the chloroplast enzyme that fixes CO<sub>2</sub> in photosynthesis, but the enzyme also fixes O<sub>2</sub>, which leads to the wasteful photorespiratory pathway. If we better understand the structure-function relationship of the enzyme, we might be able to engineer improvements. When the crystal structure of Chlamydomonas Rubisco was solved, four new posttranslational modifications were observed which are not present in other species. The modifications were 4-hydroxylation of the conserved Pro-104 and 151 residues, and S-methylation of the variable Cys-256 and 369 residues, which are Phe-256 and Val-369 in land plants. Because the modifications were only observed in Chlamydomonas Rubisco, they might account for the differences in kinetic properties between the algal and plant enzymes.\nMETHODS: Site-directed mutagenesis and chloroplast transformation have been used to test the essentiality of these modifications by replacing each of the residues with alanine (Ala). Biochemical analyses were done to determine the specificity factors and kinetic constants.\nRESULTS: Replacing the modified-residues in Chlamydomonas Rubisco affected the enzyme's catalytic activity. Substituting hydroxy-Pro-104 and methyl-Cys-256 with alanine influenced Rubisco catalysis.\nCONCLUSION: This is the first study on these posttranslationally-modified residues in Rubisco by genetic engineering. As these forms of modifications/regulation are not available in plants, the modified residues could be a means to modulate Rubisco activity.\nGENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: With a better understanding of Rubisco structure-function, we can define targets for improving the enzyme.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a rare but serious, inherited disorder of lipid metabolism characterized by very high total and LDL cholesterol levels from birth. It presents as cutaneous and tendon xanthomas since childhood, with or without cardiac involvement. FH is commonly caused by mutations in three genes, i.e. LDL receptor (LDLR), apolipoprotein B (ApoB) and PCSK9. We aimed to determine the spectrum of mutations in cases of homozygous FH in Asian Indians and evaluate if there was any similarity to the mutations observed in Caucasians.\nMETHODS: Sixteen homozygous FH subjects from eleven families were analyzed for mutations by Sanger sequencing. Large rearrangements in LDLR gene were evaluated by multiplex ligation probe dependent amplification (MLPA) technique.\nRESULTS: Ten mutations were observed in LDLR gene, of which four mutations were novel. No mutation was detected in ApoB gene and common PCSK9 mutation (p.D374Y). Fourteen cases had homozygous mutations; one had compound heterozygous mutation, while no mutation was detected in one clinically homozygous case. We report an interesting \"Triple hit\" case with features of homozygous FH.\nCONCLUSIONS: The spectrum of mutations in the Asian Indian population is quite heterogeneous. Of the mutations identified, 40% were novel. No mutation was observed in exons 3, 9 and 14 of LDLR gene, which are considered to be hot spots in studies done on Asian Indians in South Africa. Early detection followed by aggressive therapy, and cascade screening of extended families has been initiated to reduce the morbidity and mortality in these patients.",

In this study we genotyped a sample of 980 individuals from urban areas of ten Argentinean provinces using the Investigator\u00ae HDplex kit, aiming to provide forensic estimates for use in forensic casework and parentage testing in Argentina. We report reference allelic frequency databases for each of the provinces studied as well as for the combined samples. No deviation of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was observed. A reasonable discrimination capacity and power of exclusion was estimated which allowed predicting an acceptable forensic behavior of this kit, either to be used as the main STR panel for simple cases or as an auxiliary tool in complex cases. Additionally, population comparison tests showed that the studied samples are relatively homogeneous across the country for these STR set.",

        "abstract": "Skeletal bone age assessment is a common clinical practice to investigate endocrinology, genetic and growth disorders in children. It is generally performed by radiological examination of the left hand by using either the Greulich and Pyle (G&P) method or the Tanner-Whitehouse (TW) one. However, both clinical procedures show several limitations, from the examination effort of radiologists to (most importantly) significant intra- and inter-operator variability. To address these problems, several automated approaches (especially relying on the TW method) have been proposed; nevertheless, none of them has been proved able to generalize to different races, age ranges and genders. In this paper, we propose and test several deep learning approaches to assess skeletal bone age automatically; the results showed an average discrepancy between manual and automatic evaluation of about 0.8 years, which is state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, this is the first automated skeletal bone age assessment work tested on a public dataset and for all age ranges, races and genders, for which the source code is available, thus representing an exhaustive baseline for future research in the field. Beside the specific application scenario, this paper aims at providing answers to more general questions about deep learning on medical images: from the comparison between deep-learned features and manually-crafted ones, to the usage of deep-learning methods trained on general imagery for medical problems, to how to train a CNN with few images.",

        "abstract": "Congenital myopathies define a heterogeneous group of neuromuscular diseases with neonatal or childhood hypotonia and muscle weakness. The genetic cause is still unknown in many patients, precluding genetic counselling and better understanding of the physiopathology. To identify novel genetic causes of congenital myopathies, exome sequencing was performed in three consanguineous families. We identified two homozygous frameshift mutations and a homozygous nonsense mutation in the mitogen-activated protein triple kinase ZAK. In total, six affected patients carry these mutations. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and transcriptome analyses suggested nonsense mRNA decay as a main impact of mutations. The patients demonstrated a generalized slowly progressive muscle weakness accompanied by decreased vital capacities. A combination of proximal contractures with distal joint hyperlaxity is a distinct feature in one family. The low endurance and compound muscle action potential amplitude were strongly ameliorated on treatment with anticholinesterase inhibitor in another patient. Common histopathological features encompassed fibre size variation, predominance of type 1 fibre and centralized nuclei. A peculiar subsarcolemmal accumulation of mitochondria pointing towards the centre of the fibre was a novel histological hallmark in one family. These findings will improve the molecular diagnosis of congenital myopathies and implicate the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling as a novel pathway altered in these rare myopathies.",

        "abstract": "Alternative oxidase (AOX) is a terminal oxidase within the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) present in many organisms where it functions in the electron transport system (ETS). AOX directly accepts electrons from ubiquinol and is therefore capable of bypassing ETS Complexes III and IV. The human genome does not contain a gene coding for AOX, so AOX expression has been suggested as a gene therapy for a range of human mitochondrial diseases caused by genetic mutations that render Complex III and/or IV dysfunctional. An effective means of screening mutations amenable to AOX treatment remains to be devised. We have generated such a tool by heterologously expressing AOX from the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae under the control of a galactose promoter. Our results show that this animal AOX is monomeric and is correctly targeted to yeast mitochondria. Moreover, when expressed in yeast, Pacific oyster AOX is a functional quinol oxidase, conferring cyanide-resistant growth and myxothiazol-resistant oxygen consumption\u00a0to yeast cells and isolated mitochondria. This system represents a high-throughput screening tool for determining which Complex III and IV genetic mutations in yeast will be amenable to AOX gene therapy. As many human genes are orthologous to those found in yeast, our invention represents an efficient and cost-effective way to evaluate viable research avenues. In addition, this system provides the opportunity to learn more about the localization, structure, and regulation of AOXs from animals that are not easily reared or manipulated in the lab.",

        "abstract": "Theileria orientalis is the causative agent of benign theileriosis, which is distributed mainly in Asian countries, and causes serious economic losses in the livestock industry. The present study was performed to investigate the epidemiology of T. orientalis infections in cattle in the Republic of Korea (ROK) and to characterize the genetic diversity of T. orientalis based on the major piroplasm surface protein (MPSP) genes. In 2015, between July and August, blood samples were collected from 138 asymptomatic cattle in four different geographical regions (Hoengseong, Jeongeup, Namwon, and Jeju island) in the ROK. In total, 57 blood samples (41.3 %, 57/138) were positive for T. orientalis based on PCR amplification of the MPSP gene. A high prevalence of T. orientalis infection was observed in Jeju island, whereas the infection rate was relatively low in Jeongeup. Phylogenetic analysis showed that isolates identified in this study belonged to four MPSP genotypes, specifically types 1, 2, 3, and 7. The distribution of the four genotypes varied considerably among the four regions; types 1, 2, and 3 were detected in Jeju island, whereas types 1 and 7 were found in Namwon, types 1 and 2 in Jeongeup, and type 2 in Hoengseong. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the identification of type 7 T. orientalis in cattle in the ROK. These results suggest that the MPSP genotypes detected in this study showed genetic diversity related to geographical location. Our findings revealed that the T. orientalis infection rate was relatively high, indicating that T. orientalis infection is closely associated with grazing. Of the four MPSP genotypes, the prevalence of the most pathogenic type 2 was relatively high in the ROK. Therefore, further studies should focus on the development of an effective monitoring and prevention program for T. orientalis.",

        "abstract": "The present study examines the interaction between a polygenic score and an elementary school-based universal preventive intervention trial and its effects on a discrete-time survival analysis of time to first smoking marijuana. Research has suggested that initiation of substances is both genetically and environmentally driven (Rhee et al., Archives of general psychiatry 60:1256-1264, 2003; Verweij et al., Addiction 105:417-430, 2010). A previous work has found a significant interaction between the polygenic score and the same elementary school-based intervention with tobacco smoking (Musci et al., in press). The polygenic score reflects the contribution of multiple genes and has been shown in prior research to be predictive of smoking cessation, tobacco use, and marijuana use (Uhl et al., Molecular Psychiatry 19:50-54, 2014). Using data from a longitudinal preventive intervention study (N\u2009=\u2009678), we examined age of first marijuana use from sixth grade to age 18. Genetic data were collected during emerging adulthood and were genotyped using the Affymetrix 6.0 microarray (N\u2009=\u2009545). The polygenic score was computed using these data. Discrete-time survival analysis was employed to test for intervention main and interaction effects with the polygenic score. We found main effect of the polygenic score approaching significance, with the participants with higher polygenic scores reporting their first smoking marijuana at an age significantly later than controls (p\u2009=\u2009.050). We also found a significant intervention \u00d7 polygenic score interaction effect at p\u2009=\u2009.003, with participants at the higher end of the polygenic score benefiting the most from the intervention in terms of delayed age of first use. These results suggest that genetics may play an important role in the age of first use of marijuana and that differences in genetics may account for the differential effectiveness of classroom-based interventions in delaying substance use experimentation.",

We aimed to assess the prevalence and the risk factors of cord vitamin D deficiency (s-25(OH)D <25\u00a0nmol/L) and insufficiency (s-25(OH)D 25-50\u00a0nmol/L) and to evaluate the association between cord s-25(OH)D levels and neonatal outcomes (BW, PW and PW/BW ratio).\nMETHODS: Women enrolled in Odense Child Cohort, a Danish observational prospective population-based cohort, who gave birth to singletons and donated a blood sample for s-25(OH)D measurements were included (n\u00a0=\u00a02082).\nRESULTS: The prevalence of cord vitamin D deficiency was 16.7% and 41.0% for insufficiency. White skin, winter season at birth, maternal supplementation dose of <15\u00a0\u03bcg/day, non-western ethnicity and high body mass index (BMI) were identified as independent risk factors of both vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency. Adherence to the recommended vitamin D supplementation dose (10\u00a0\u03bcg/day) was reported by 87% (primipara 91% vs. multipara 81%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). An U-shaped relationship between cord s-25(OH)D and BW was visualized by spline regression (p\u00a0=\u00a00.003). After adjustment, cord s-25(OH)D was positively associated with BW (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a01.522, p\u00a0=\u00a00.026), PW (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.927, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and PW/BW ratio (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.018, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), largely driven by positive associations for cord s-25(OH)D >60\u00a0nmol/L.\nCONCLUSION: Cord hypovitaminosis D was present in 57.7%.

Higher BW, PW, and PW/BW ratio were associated to higher cord s-25(OH)D levels with a suggested cut-off at 60\u00a0nmol/L. More studies are encouraged to elucidate the impact of cord s-25(OH)D levels on offspring health and to establish optimal cut-offs for these outcomes.",

Plasma glucose concentrations were compared in term infants born in 2008 who were not at risk for neonatal hypoglycemia and who were fed before (early feeders) and after (late feeders) their initial glucose screens. Multiple linear regression models were built to determine whether glucose concentrations differed significantly between early vs late feeders.\nRESULTS: In the 315 early and 572 late feeders, the mean (SD) age of first feeding was 0.9 (0.6) and 3.8 (2.0) hours, respectively. The age at initial glucose specimen collection was 2.2 (1.1) and 1.8 (0.8) hours, respectively. The initial glucose concentration was not higher in early vs late feeders (51.8\u2009\u00b1\u200911.9 vs 55.5\u2009\u00b1\u200913.3\u2009mg/dL; P\u2009<\u2009.001). In linear regression analyses of all infants, the mean initial glucose concentration was 3.61 (95% CI 1.75-5.48) mg/dL lower in early vs late feeders.\nCONCLUSIONS: Early feeding in otherwise healthy term newborns did not increase initial glucose concentrations compared with newborns who fed later (ie, fasted).

Plexiform neurofibromas (PNs) involving the eyelid, orbit, periorbital, and facial structures (orbital-periorbital plexiform neurofibroma [OPPN]) can result in significant visual loss in children. Equally important, OPPNs can cause significant alteration in physical appearance secondary to proptosis, ptosis, and facial disfigurement, leading to social embarrassment and decreased self-esteem.\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE: Although NF1 is a relatively common disease in which routine ophthalmologic examinations are required, no formal recommendations for clinical care of children with OPPNs exist. Although medical and surgical interventions have been reported, there are no agreed-on criteria for when OPPNs require therapy and which treatment produces the best outcome.\nMETHODS: Because a multidisciplinary team of specialists (oculofacial plastics, pediatric ophthalmology, neuro-ophthalmology, medical genetics, and neuro-oncology) direct management decisions, the absence of a uniform outcome measure that represents visual or aesthetic sequelae complicates the design of evidence-based studies and feasible clinical trials.\nRESULTS: In September 2013, a multidisciplinary task force, composed of pediatric practitioners from tertiary care centers experienced in caring for children with OPPN, was convened to address the lack of clinical care guidelines for children with OPPN.\nCONCLUSIONS: This consensus statement provides recommendations for ophthalmologic monitoring, outlines treatment indications and forthcoming biologic therapy, and discusses challenges to performing clinical trials in this complicated condition.",

We identified 2 heterozygous missense variants in 2 unrelated PD cases and not in our control database (p.Y106H and p.I162V), and a heterozygous missense variant in 2 PD cases from the same family (p.A163T). However, data presented herein is not sufficient to support the role of any of these variants in PD pathology. A series of unified sequence kernel association tests also failed to show a cumulative effect of rare variation in this gene on the risk of PD in the general Caucasian population. Further evaluation of genetic data from different populations is needed to understand the genetic role of TMEM230 in PD etiology.",

        "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked recessive disorder in which loss of the dystrophin protein causes progressive skeletal/cardiac muscle degeneration and death within the third decade. For clinical trials and supportive animal studies, DMD disease progression and response to treatment must be established using outcome parameters (biomarkers). The 6-minute walk test (6MWT), defined as the distance an individual can walk in 6 minutes, is commonly used in DMD clinical trials and has been employed in dogs to characterize cardiac and respiratory disease severity. Building on methods established in DMD and canine clinical studies, we assessed the 6MWT in dogs with the DMD genetic homolog, golden retriever muscular dystrophy (GRMD). Twenty-one cross-bred golden retrievers were categorized as affected (DMD mutation and GRMD phenotype), carrier (female heterozygous for DMD mutation and no phenotype), and normal (wild type DMD gene and normal phenotype). When compared to grouped normal/carrier dogs, GRMD dogs walked shorter height-adjusted distances at 6 and 12 months of age and their distances walked declined with age. Percent change in creatine kinase after 6MWT was greater in GRMD versus normal/carrier dogs at 6 months, providing another potential biomarker. While these data generally support use of the 6MWT as a biomarker for preclinical GRMD treatment trials, there were certain limitations. Results of the 6MWT did not correlate with other outcome parameters for GRMD dogs when considered alone and an 80% increase in mean distance walked would be necessary to achieve satisfactory power.",

A surprising number of variants have been found in the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) gene family, with the GRIN2B gene encoding the GluN2B subunit being implicated in many cases of neurodevelopmental disorders, which are psychiatric conditions originating in childhood and include language, motor, and learning disorders, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), developmental delay, epilepsy, and schizophrenia. The GRIN2B gene plays a crucial role in normal neuronal development and is important for learning and memory. Mutations in human GRIN2B were distributed throughout the entire gene in a number of patients with various neuropsychiatric and developmental disorders. Studies that provide functional analysis of variants are still lacking, however current analysis of de novo variants that segregate with disease cases such as intellectual disability, developmental delay, ASD or epileptic encephalopathies reveal altered NMDAR function. Here, we summarize the current reports of disease-associated variants in GRIN2B from patients with multiple neurodevelopmental disorders, and discuss implications, highlighting the importance of functional analysis and precision medicine therapies.",

The Laerdal\u00ae Neonatal Intubation Trainer was modified by applying pressure sensors on areas that are mainly subject to stress and potential injuries. Punctual Force Sensing Resistors (FSRs) were characterized and fixed on the external side of the airway structure on the dental arches and epiglottis. A custom silicone tongue was designed and developed to integrate a matrix textile sensor for mapping the pressure applied on its whole surface. The assessment of the developed tool was performed by nine clinical experts who were asked to practice three intubation procedures apiece. Median and maximum forces, over threshold events (i.e. 2N for gingival arch sensors and 7N for epiglottis and tongue sensors respectively) and execution time were measured for each trainee. Data analysis from training sessions revealed that the epiglottis is the point mainly stressed during an intubation procedure (maximum value: 16.69N, median value: 3.11N), while the analysis carried out on the pressure distribution on the instrumented tongue provided information on both force values and distribution, according to clinicians' performance. The debriefing phase was used to enhance the clinicians' awareness of applied force and gestures performed, confirming that the present study is an adequate starting point for achieving and optimizing neonatal intubation skills for both residents and expert clinicians.",

        "abstract": "Accruing evidence have confirmed that the fetal programming in response to adverse environmental in utero factors plays essential roles in the pathogenesis of hypertension in later life. High sugar intake has been accepted worldwide in everyday life diet and becomes the critical public health issue. Our previous studies indicated that intake of high sucrose (HS) during pregnancy could change the vascular reactivity and dipsogenic behavior closely associated with abnormal renin-angiotensin system (RAS), to increase the risk of hypertension in adult offspring. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that maternal HS intake in pregnancy may further deteriorate the Ang II-induced cardiovascular responses in the aged offspring. HS intake was provided to pregnant rats throughout the gestation. Blood pressure (BP) in conscious state and vascular contractility in vitro were measured in 22-month-old aged offspring rats. In addition, mRNA and protein expressions and epigenetic changes of Ang II type 1 receptor (AT<sub>1</sub>R) gene in blood vessels were determined with the methods of real-time RT-PCR, Western blotting, and Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay (CHIP). Results showed that, in the aged offspring, maternal HS intake during gestation would cause the elevation of basal BP which could be diminished by losartan. Although the circulatory Ang II was not changed, levels of local Ang II were significantly increased in blood vessels. In addition, prenatal HS exposure would significantly enhance the AT<sub>1</sub>R-mediated vasoconstrictions in both aorta and mesenteric arteries of the aged offspring. Moreover, in the aged offspring of prenatal HS exposure, mRNA and protein expressions of AT<sub>1</sub>R gene in both large and small blood vessels were significantly increased, which should be closely associated with the changes of epigenetic mechanisms such as histone modifications. Collectively, we proposed that maternal HS intake during gestation would cause abnormal BP responses mediated via the enhancement of vascular RAS, together with the increased expression of AT<sub>1</sub>R gene related to the its epigenetic changes, which would actually lead to the overt phenotype of hypertension in the aged offspring.",

Although recent studies have identified KORs as a primary mediator of BPN's effects in rodent models of depressive-like behavior, the role of MORs in BPN's behavioral effects has not been as well explored. The current studies investigated the role of MORs in mediating conditioned approach behavior in the novelty-induced hypophagia (NIH) test, a behavioral measure previously shown to be sensitive to chronic treatment with antidepressant drugs. The effects of BPN were evaluated in the NIH test 24h post-administration in mice with genetic deletion of the MOR (Oprm1-/-) or KOR (Oprk1-/-), or after pharmacological blockade with the non-selective opioid receptor antagonist naltrexone and selective MOR antagonist cyprodime. We found that behavioral responses to BPN in the NIH test were blocked in Oprm1-/- mice, but not in Oprk1-/- mice. Both cyprodime and naltrexone significantly reduced approach latency at doses experimentally proven to antagonize the MOR. In contrast the selective MOR agonist morphine and the selective KOR antagonist nor-BNI were both ineffective. Moreover, antinociceptive studies revealed persistence of the MOR antagonist properties of BPN at 24h post-administration, the period of behavioral reactivity. These data support modulation of MOR activity as a key component of BPN's antidepressant-like effects in the NIH paradigm.",

        "abstract": "Almost two decades after the identification of SNCA as the first causative gene in Parkinson's disease (PD) and the subsequent understanding that genetic factors play a substantial role in PD development, our knowledge of the genetic architecture underlying this disease has vastly improved. Approximately 5-10% of patients suffer from a monogenic form of PD where autosomal dominant mutations in SNCA, LRRK2, and VPS35 and autosomal recessive mutations in PINK1, DJ-1, and Parkin cause the disease with high penetrance. Furthermore, recent whole-exome sequencing have described autosomal recessive DNAJC6 mutations in predominately atypical, but also cases with typical PD. In addition, several other genes have been linked to atypical Parkinsonian phenotypes. However, the vast majority of PD is genetically complex, i.e. it is caused by the combined action of common genetic variants in concert with environmental factors. By the application of genome-wide association studies, 26 PD risk loci have been established to date. Similar to other genetically complex diseases, these show only moderate effects on PD risk. Increasing this etiologic complexity, many of the involved genetic and environmental risk factors likely interact in an intricate fashion.

Its improvement by combining cytology with molecular markers is still a matter of investigation. In this study, 2 molecular markers were used: caveolin-1 and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), along with the well-established genetic marker BRAF V600E mutation. We set out to determine the expression signatures of EGFR and caveolin-1 in patients with thyroid malignancy as well as to determine their possible association with disease severity. In FNA biopsy samples (n=186), immunocytochemical expression of caveolin-1 and BRAF V600E mutation coincided with malignancy. The patients were sorted according to 3 parameters: final histopathological diagnosis, caveolin-1 expression, and BRAF V600E mutation status before measurement of EGFR mRNA expression. EGFR upregulation was detected in the group of patients with malignant diagnosis, no caveolin-1 expression, and wild-type BRAF. Spearman rank correlation yielded a statistically significant negative correlation of EGFR and caveolin-1. Double immunofluorescence confirmed colocalization and inverse expression of EGFR and caveolin-1. Our data demonstrated that EGFR overexpression is associated with malignancy but not with tumor aggressiveness. Furthermore, high-caveolin-1/low-EGFR cases were associated with an advanced pT status and had a greater degree of neoplastic infiltration than low-caveolin-1/high-EGFR cases. Combining caveolin-1 and BRAF V600E with EGFR might help in recognizing more aggressive thyroid lesions in a pool of relatively indolent tumors in FNA biopsies and thus be useful for early risk stratification of thyroid cancer patients.",

        "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Engineered 3D cardiac tissue constructs (ECTCs) can replicate complex cardiac physiology under normal and pathological conditions. Currently, most measurements of ECTC contractility are either made isometrically, with fixed length and without control of the applied force, or auxotonically against a variable force, with the length changing during the contraction. The \"I-Wire\" platform addresses the unmet need to control the force applied to ECTCs while interrogating their passive and active mechanical and electrical characteristics. A six-well plate with inserted PDMS casting molds containing neonatal rat cardiomyocytes cultured with fibrin for 13-15days is mounted on the motorized mechanical stage of an inverted microscope equipped with a fast sCMOS camera. A calibrated flexible probe provides strain load of the ECTC via lateral displacement, and the microscope detects the deflections of both the probe and the ECTC. The ECTCs exhibited longitudinally aligned cardiomyocytes with well-developed sarcomeric structure, recapitulated the Frank-Starling force-tension relationship, and demonstrated expected transmembrane action potentials, electrical and mechanical restitutions, and responses to both \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation and blebbistatin. The I-Wire platform enables creation and mechanical and electrical characterization of ECTCs, and hence can be valuable in the study of cardiac diseases, drug screening, drug development, and the qualification of cells for tissue-engineered regenerative medicine.\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: There is a growing interest in creating engineered heart tissue constructs for basic cardiac research, applied research in cardiac pharmacology, and repair of damaged hearts. We address an unmet need to characterize fully the performance of these tissues with our simple \"I-Wire\" assay that allows application of controlled forces to three-dimensional cardiac fiber constructs and measurement of both the electrical and mechanical properties of the construct. The advantage of I-Wire over other approaches is that the constructs being measured are truly three-dimensional, rather than a single layer of cells grown within a microfluidic device. We anticipate that the I-Wire will be extremely useful for the evaluation of myocardial constructs created using cardiomyocytes derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells.",

The zinc finger protein GATA4 is one such transcription factor involved in the regulation of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. In response to hypertrophic stimuli such as those involving the sympathetic nervous and renin-angiotensin systems, changes in protein interaction and/or post-translational modifications of GATA4 cause hypertrophic gene transcription in cardiomyocytes.

The model was based on short term exposure assays (3 days) and the training was limited to oxidative stressors, peroxisome proliferators and hormone modulators. Validation of the predictor was performed on independent toxicogenomic data (TG-GATEs, Toxicogenomics Project-Genomics Assisted Toxicity Evaluation System, Osaka, Japan). To build our model we performed Random Forests together with a recursive elimination algorithm (VarSelRF). Gene set enrichment analysis was employed for functional interpretation. A total of 770 microarrays comprising 96 different compounds were analyzed and a predictor of 54 genes was built. Prediction accuracy was 0.85 in the training set, 0.87 in the test set and increased with increasing concentration in the validation set: 0.6 at low dose, 0.7 at medium doses and 0.81 at high doses. Pathway analysis revealed gene prominence of cellular respiration, energy production and lipoprotein metabolism.

The offspring proved to be not from a single bi-parental cross. In rose breeding, crosses with unintended parents occur regularly. We developed a strategy to separate progeny into putative populations, even while one of the parents was unknown, using principle component analysis on pairwise genetic distances based on sets of selected SNP markers that were homozygous, and therefore uninformative for one parent. One of the inferred populations was consistent with self-fertilization of 'Red New Dawn'. Subsequently, linkage maps were generated for a bi-parental and a self-pollinated population with 'Red New Dawn' as the common maternal parent.

After primary vaccination, the combined risk ratio (RRs) of immune response against seven common serotypes and additional serotype 1 was approximated to 1.00 with narrow 95\u00a0% confidence interval (CI) between preterm infants and full-term infants, and at least 91\u00a0% sero-conversion of two additional serotypes, 5 and 7F in two cohorts was observed. Furthermore, between very-low-birth-weight (VLBW) infants of <1500\u00a0g and 1501\u00a0~\u00a02500\u00a0g, overall RRs of immune response to PCV-7 administration was 0.98 (95%CI: 0.96\u00a0~\u00a01.00).\nCONCLUSIONS: Preterm infants have a great tolerance to PCV-7, PCV-10 or PCV-13 vaccination. PCV-7 could elicit optimal immune response post vaccination in preterm infants, even in VLBW infants.",

        "abstract": "With ongoing developments in technology, changes in DNA methylation levels have become prevalent to study cancer biology. Previous studies report that DNA methylation affects gene expression in a direct manner, most probably by blocking gene regulatory regions. In this study, we have studied the interplay between methylation and expression to improve our knowledge of cancer aetiology. For this purpose, we have investigated which genomic regions are of higher importance; hence, first exon, 5'UTR and 200\u00a0bp near the transcription start sites are proposed as being more crucial compared to other genomic regions. Furthermore, we have searched for a valid methylation level change threshold, and as a result, 25\u00a0% methylation change in previously determined genomic regions showed the highest inverse correlation with expression data. As a final step, we have examined the commonly affected genes and pathways by integrating methylation and expression information. Remarkably, the GPR115 gene and ErbB signalling pathway were found to be significantly altered for all cancer types in our analysis. Overall, combining methylation and expression information and identifying commonly affected genes and pathways in a variety of cancer types revealed new insights of cancer disease mechanisms. Moreover, compared to previous methylation-based studies, we have identified more important genomic regions and have defined a methylation change threshold level in order to obtain more reliable results. In addition to the novel analysis framework that involves the analysis of four different cancer types, our study exposes essential information regarding the contribution of methylation changes and its impact on cancer disease biology, which may facilitate the identification of new drug targets.",

However, it is assumed that genetic predispositions to HM are currently underestimated due to great variations in disease phenotype, variable latency and incomplete penetrance. Most of patients do not display any biological or clinical signs besides the overt hematological disease and many of them have a lack of personal or family history of malignancies. Areas covered: Collaborative studies and important advances in molecular testing have led to the discovery of several genes recurrently deregulated in familial HM including RUNX1, CEBPA, GATA2, ANKRD26, SRP72, PAX5, DDX41, ETV6, ATG2B/GSKIP and TERT/TERC. This review summarizes biological and clinical findings encountered within these disorders. Expert commentary: Identify and manage individuals with genetic predisposition is a current challenge for hematologists. Their identification has immediate implications for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation including donor selection and conditioning regimen. Importantly, several features, including familial and personal history as well as molecular and cytogenetic findings, may help clinicians to suspect an underlying genetic predisposition.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Although prescription rates of antidepressants for children and adolescents have increased, concerns have been raised regarding effects on neurodevelopment and long-term outcome. Using a genetic animal model of depression, this study investigated the long-term effects of pre-pubertal administration of fluoxetine (FLX) on depressive-like behaviour in early adulthood, as well as on central monoaminergic response to an acute stressor. We postulated that pre-pubertal FLX will have lasting effects on animal behaviour and monoaminergic stress responses in early adulthood.\nMETHODS: Flinders sensitive line (FSL) rats received 10 mg/kg/day FLX subcutaneously from postnatal day 21 (PnD21) to PnD34 (pre-pubertal). Thereafter, following normal housing, rats were either subjected to locomotor testing and the forced swim test (FST) on PnD60 (early adulthood), or underwent surgery for microdialysis, followed on PnD60 by exposure to acute swim stress and measurement of stressor-induced changes in plasma corticosterone and pre-frontal cortical monoamine concentrations.\nRESULTS: Pre-pubertal FLX did not induce a late emergent effect on immobility in FSL rats on PnD60, whereas locomotor activity was significantly decreased. Acute swim stress on PnD60 significantly increased plasma corticosterone levels, and increased pre-frontal cortical norepinephrine (NE) and 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid (5-HIAA) concentrations. Pre-pubertal FLX significantly blunted the pre-frontal cortical NE and 5-HIAA response following swim stress on PnD60. Baseline dopamine levels were significantly enhanced by pre-pubertal FLX, but no further changes were induced by swim stress.\nCONCLUSION: Pre-pubertal FLX did not have lasting antidepressant-like behavioural effects in genetically susceptible, stress-sensitive FSL rats. However, such treatment reduced locomotor activity, abrogated noradrenergic and serotonergic stressor responses and elevated dopaminergic baseline levels in adulthood.",

        "abstract": "The profitability of dual-purpose breeding farms can be increased through genetic improvement of carcass traits. To develop a genetic evaluation of carcass traits of young bulls, breed-specific genetic parameters were estimated in three French dual-purpose breeds. Genetic correlations between these traits and veal calf, type and milk production traits were also estimated. Slaughter performances of 156 226 Montbeliarde, 160 361 Normande and 8691 Simmental young bulls were analyzed with a multitrait animal model. In the three breeds, heritabilities were moderate for carcass weight (0.12 to 0.19\u00b10.01 to 0.04) and carcass conformation (0.21 to 0.26\u00b10.01 to 0.04) and slightly lower for age at slaughter (0.08 to 0.17\u00b10.01 to 0.03). For all three breeds, genetic correlations between carcass weight and carcass conformation were moderate and favorable (0.30 to 0.52\u00b10.03 to 0.13). They were strong and favorable (-0.49 to -0.71\u00b10.05 to 0.15) between carcass weight and age at slaughter. Between age at slaughter and carcass conformation, they were low and unfavorable to moderate and favorable (-0.25 to 0.10\u00b10.06 to 0.18). Heavier young bulls tend to be better conformed and slaughtered earlier. Genetic correlations between corresponding young bulls and veal production traits were moderate and favorable (0.32 to 0.70\u00b10.03 to 0.09), implying that selecting sires for veal calf production leads to select sires producing better young bulls. Genetic correlations between young bull carcass weight and cow size were moderately favorable (0.22 to 0.45\u00b10.04 to 0.10). Young bull carcass conformation had moderate and favorable genetic correlations (0.11 to 0.24\u00b10.04 to 0.10) with cow width but moderate and unfavorable genetic correlations (-0.21 to -0.36\u00b10.03 to 0.08) with cow height. Taller cows tended to produce heavier young bulls and thinner cows to produce less conformed ones. Genetic correlations between carcass traits of young bulls and cow muscularity traits were low to moderate and favorable. Finally, genetic correlations between carcass traits of young bulls and milk production traits were low and unfavorable to moderate and favorable. These results indicate the existence for all three breeds of genetic variability for the genetic improvement of carcass traits of young bulls as well as favorable genetic correlations for their simultaneous selection and no strong unfavorable correlation with milk production traits.",

In the elevated plus maze task, we found that HT mice after seizures displayed increased total distance and velocity as compared to HT mice that did not undergo seizures and WT controls. In the social chamber test, we found the HT mice after seizures displayed an impairment in social behavior.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The study's purpose was to investigate moderator, implementation, and mediator variables related to the efficacy of UV4.me, an Internet intervention that decreased ultraviolet radiation (UV) exposure and increased skin protection behaviors among young adults.\nMETHOD: A total of 965 18-25 year olds at risk for skin cancer were recruited nationally online. Participants were randomized to an experimental website (UV4.me), a control website, or assessment only. Participant characteristics (moderators), engagement with and perceptions of interventions (implementation measures), and exposure and protection attitudinal variables (mediators) were assessed. Linear regression and mediation analyses were conducted.\nRESULTS: Intervention effects on skin protection were greater for participants with a family history of skin cancer (p = .01). Intervention effects on UV exposure were greater among recent indoor tanners (p = .04). Improvements in skin protection (but not UV exposure) were associated with perceiving the interventions as satisfying or helpful (ps < .01). The experimental group had better outcomes if they completed more modules (ps < .01) or set more behavioral goals (ps < .01). Knowledge and exposure decisional balance mediated intervention effects for UV exposure (ps < .05), and protection decisional balance, self-efficacy, and intentions mediated intervention effects for protection (ps < .05).\nCONCLUSIONS: The experimental intervention was more efficacious for certain high risk groups. The more individuals liked and engaged with the interventions (e.g., by setting goals), the better their outcomes. Mediation results inform theory about change mechanisms and differed by behavioral outcome. (PsycINFO Database Record",

        "abstract": "Several recent studies of the hierarchical phenotypic structure of psychopathology have identified a General psychopathology factor in addition to the more expected specific Externalizing and Internalizing dimensions in both youth and adult samples and some have found relevant unique external correlates of this General factor. We used data from 1,568 twin pairs (599 MZ & 969 DZ) age 9 to 17 to test hypotheses for the underlying structure of youth psychopathology and the external validity of the higher-order factors. Psychopathology symptoms were assessed via structured interviews of caretakers and youth. We conducted phenotypic analyses of competing structural models using Confirmatory Factor Analysis and used Structural Equation Modeling and multivariate behavior genetic analyses to understand the etiology of the higher-order factors and their external validity. We found that both a General factor and specific Externalizing and Internalizing dimensions are necessary for characterizing youth psychopathology at both the phenotypic and etiologic levels, and that the 3 higher-order factors differed substantially in the magnitudes of their underlying genetic and environmental influences. Phenotypically, the specific Externalizing and Internalizing dimensions were slightly negatively correlated when a General factor was included, which reflected a significant inverse correlation between the nonshared environmental (but not genetic) influences on Internalizing and Externalizing. We estimated heritability of the general factor of psychopathology for the first time. Its moderate heritability suggests that it is not merely an artifact of measurement error but a valid construct. The General, Externalizing, and Internalizing factors differed in their relations with 3 external validity criteria: mother's smoking during pregnancy, parent's harsh discipline, and the youth's association with delinquent peers. Multivariate behavior genetic analyses supported the external validity of the 3 higher-order factors by suggesting that the General, Externalizing, and Internalizing factors were correlated with peer delinquency and parent's harsh discipline for different etiologic reasons.

        "abstract": "Despite the increased worldwide awareness, over the last decade, of the platelet-type von Willebrand Disease (PT-VWD), many uncertainties remain around this rare platelet bleeding disorder. This report aims to correctly identify and study the phenotype of new patients and highlights the diagnostic and therapeutic challenges this disease remains to pose. We describe four PT-VWD cases confirmed by genetic analysis in which either the diagnosis and/or the treatment posed challenge. We provide the details of the clinical presentation, laboratory analysis, and the treatment and the responses in each case. We show that in addition to type 2B VWD, PT-VWD can be misdiagnosed as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia, and unexplained gestational thrombocytopenia. The disease can be diagnosed as early as 1 year of age and with phenotypically normal parents. Bleeding in some patients can be managed successfully using Humate P and DDAVP combined with tranexamic acid with no significant thrombocytopenia. We provide for the first time an evidence of an efficient response to rFVIIa in PT-VWD. Anaphylactic reaction to VWF preparations may be related to PT-VWD and the development of HLA antibodies is not uncommon. Progressive thrombocytopenia with normal VWF levels can be seen with PT-VWD and the platelet count was normalized at 2.5 weeks postpartum in one case. We conclude that these studies represent a record of clinical observations/interventions that help improve diagnoses/management of PT-VWD, highlight the variations in age and clinical presentations, laboratory diagnostic approaches, the importance of genetic testing for accurate diagnosis and consideration of therapeutic alternatives.",

DMS-MaPseq yields a high signal-to-noise ratio, can report multiple structural features per molecule, and allows both genome-wide studies and focused in vivo investigations of even low-abundance RNAs. We apply DMS-MaPseq for the first analysis of RNA structure within an animal tissue and to identify a functional structure involved in noncanonical translation initiation. Additionally, we use DMS-MaPseq to compare the in vivo structure of pre-mRNAs with their mature isoforms.

However, the mechanisms underlying long-term cognitive deficits induced by sevoflurane exposure remain unknown. The present study was performed to investigate whether there is differential neuronal activation between naive mice and sevoflurane-exposed neonates in fear-conditioning tests based on immediate early gene (c-Fos) expression.\nMETHODS: Male mice were exposed to 3% sevoflurane (SEVO group) or carrier gas alone (no anesthesia, NA group) for 6 hours on postnatal day 6. The mice were allowed to mature before performing the contextual fear-conditioning test. A reduced freezing response was confirmed in the SEVO group. Neural activation in the regions of the medial prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala was investigated using c-Fos immunostaining 2 hours after the test. The types of neurons activated were also identified.\nRESULTS: The number of c-Fos-positive cells decreased by 27% in the basolateral amygdala in the SEVO group, while no significant changes were observed in other regions. Furthermore, glutamatergic, but not \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic, neurons expressed c-Fos after the contextual fear-conditioning test in both groups. The number of glutamatergic neurons in the basolateral amygdala in the SEVO group was reduced by 27%.\nCONCLUSIONS: Decreased neural activation in the basolateral amygdala may be associated with reduced freezing time in neonatal sevoflurane-exposed mice. Fewer glutamatergic neurons responding to fear stimuli in the basolateral amygdala may contribute to decreased neural activation and learning deficits in mice exposed to sevoflurane as neonates.",

Adequately powered studies in the pediatric surgical population are scarce, and it is unclear whether such preclinical findings are relevant for the pediatric setting.\nOBJECTIVE: To examine the association of anesthesia and surgery before age 4 years with long-term academic and cognitive performance indexed by school grades at age 16 years and IQ test scores at military conscription.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This investigation was a cohort study among all children born in Sweden between January 1973 and December 1993. The dates of analysis were April 2013 to October 2015. Among all 2\u202f174\u202f073 Swedish children born between 1973 and 1993, we identified a primary study cohort of 33\u202f514 children with 1 anesthesia and surgery exposure before age 4 years and no subsequent hospitalization and 159\u202f619 matched unexposed control children. In addition, 3640 children with multiple surgical procedures before age 4 years were studied.\nEXPOSURE: Having at least 1 surgical procedure in the Swedish Patient Register before age 4 years.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The mean school grades at age 16 years and IQ test scores at military conscription at age 18 years. The mean difference between the exposed cohort and unexposed cohort was estimated in a model that included sex, month of birth during the same year, gestational age at delivery, Apgar score at 5 minutes, maternal and paternal educational levels, annual taxable household income, cohabiting parents, and number of siblings.\nRESULTS: Among 33\u202f514 exposed children (22\u202f484 male and 11\u202f030 female) and 159\u202f619 unexposed children (105\u202f812 male and 53\u202f807 female) in the primary study cohort, 1 exposure before age 4 years was associated with a mean difference of 0.41% (95% CI, 0.12%-0.70%) lower school grades and 0.97% (95% CI, 0.15%-1.78%) lower IQ test scores. The magnitude of the difference was the same after multiple exposures. There was no difference in school grades with 1 exposure before ages 6 months, 7 to 12 months, 13 to 24 months, or 25 to 36 months. The overall difference was markedly less than the differences associated with sex, maternal educational level, or month of birth during the same year.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Exposure to anesthesia and surgery before age 4 years has a small association with later academic performance or cognitive performance in adolescence on a population level. While more vulnerable subgroups of children may exist, the low overall difference in academic performance after childhood exposure to surgery is reassuring. These findings should be interpreted in light of potential adverse effects of postponing surgery.",

Phenotypic evaluation consisted of clinical examination, including visual acuity and residual retinal area by fundus autofluorescence (FAF). Genotype was established by sequencing. We also investigated whether particular genotypes were associated with more severe phenotypes by performing analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), with visual acuity and FAF as the dependent variables and age as the covariant.\nRESULTS: A total of 74 (94%) of patients in our cohort had causative mutations by sequencing, the majority of which were anticipated to be null. Of these, 35 (47%) had insertions and deletions, 13 (18%) had mutations predicted to affect splicing, and 26 (35%) had single point mutations. In the latter case, 13 of 21 (62%) pedigrees with single point mutations were C to T transitions at C-phosphate-G (CpG) dinucleotides. These mutations were spread across 5 of only 24 CpG dinucleotides in the entire CHM cDNA. Furthermore, these 5 locations are the only sites at which C to T transitions result in a stop codon. No clear evidence was found for genotype-phenotype correlation except in the instance of a patient with a large deletion involving neighbouring sequences.\nCONCLUSIONS: In patients with a diagnosis of choroideremia made by a specialty service, there is a high likelihood of establishing a genetic diagnosis. The majority of causative mutations appear to be null and, therefore, may benefit from gene replacement therapy. A disproportionate number of single point mutations observed were C to T transitions, consistent with the evolutionary decay of CpG dinucleotides through methylation and subsequent deamination. Hence, the development of choroideremia in such patients may represent the unwanted consequence of human evolution; de novo mutations are predicted to arise at these sites in future generations.

        "abstract": "The pearl oyster Pinctada fucata is an important commercial marine shellfish that is cultured for producing saltwater pearls. In this study, 468 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were screened from P. fucata transcriptome data, and 119 polymorphic SNPs were successfully isolated by a two-step small-amplicon high-resolution melting assay. Of these, 88 were annotated with BLAST in the Nr database and 90 were in the open reading frame, including 16 non-synonymous SNPs and 74 synonymous SNPs; 12 SNPs were in the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) and 1 was in the 5'-UTR. Twenty-five SNPs were randomly chosen to test the genetic diversity of 40 wild individuals from Liusha Bay, China. All of the loci had two alleles. The observed and expected heterozygosities ranged from 0.0417 to 0.6042 and from 0.2945 to 0.5053, respectively. Minor allele frequencies ranged from 0.1771 to 0.5000, and the polymorphism information content ranged from 0.2516 to 0.3750.

The objective of this study was to summarize the current knowledge of this rare condition based on a detailed review of 96 documented cases.\nMETHODS: The incidence, clinical and histological appearance, differential diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of CHR were analyzed by evaluating clinical data obtained from 96 cases in the literature since the first case report in 1934.\nRESULTS: More than 90% of cases of CHR have been reported in white individuals with even gender distribution. A majority of patients presented a unilateral unifocal lesion without positive family history. Our analysis showed bilateral cases were strongly correlated with family history, which suggests the importance of screenings for family members in bilateral CHR cases. Intracranial involvement was reported in 14% of CHR cases. Most patients were asymptomatic, but in patients with history of headaches, transient visual disturbance, or seizures 80% had intracranial involvement.\nCONCLUSION: It is important to screen family members in bilateral CHR cases, and it is critical to exclude cerebral vascular abnormalities in view of relative high incidence of intracranial involvement and high morbidity.",

        "abstract": "Candida tropicalis is an important pathogen. Here we developed and evaluated a polymorphic multilocus microsatellite scheme employing novel genetic markers for genotyping of C. tropicalis. Using 10 isolates from 10 unique (separate) patients to screen over 4000 tandem repeats from the C. tropicalis genome (strain MYA-3404), six new candidate microsatellite loci (ctm1, ctm3, ctm8, ctm18, ctm24 and ctm26) were selected according to amplification success, observed polymorphisms and stability of flanking regions by preliminary testing. Two known microsatellite loci CT14 and URA3 were also studied. The 6-locus scheme was then tested against a set of 82 different isolates from 32 patients. Microsatellite genotypes of isolates from the same patient (two to five isolates per patient) were identical. The six loci produced eight to 17 allele types and identified 11 to 24 genotypes amongst 32 patients' isolates, achieving a discriminatory power (DP) of 0.76 to 0.97 (versus 0.78 for both CT14 and URA3 loci, respectively). Testing of a combination of only three loci, ctm1, ctm3 and ctm24, also achieved maximum typing efficiency (DP = 0.99, 29 genotypes). The microsatellite typing scheme had good correlation compared with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, although was slightly less discriminatory. The new six-locus microsatellite typing scheme is a potentially valuable tool for genotyping and investigating microevolution of C. tropicalis.",

        "title": "Heparin for the treatment of thrombosis in neonates.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Among pediatric patients, newborns are at highest risk of developing thromboembolism. Neonatal thromboembolic (TE) events may consist of both venous and arterial thromboses and often iatrogenic complications (eg, central catheterization). Treatment guidelines for pediatric patients with TE events most often are extrapolated from the literature regarding adults. Options for the management of neonatal TE events include expectant management; nitroglycerin ointment; thrombolytic therapy or anticoagulant therapy, or a combination of the two; and surgery. Since the 1990s, low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) has become the neonatal anticoagulant of choice. Reasons for its appeal include predictable dose response, no need for venous access, and limited monitoring requirements. The overall major complication rate is around 5%. Whether preterm infants are at increased risk is unclear. No data are available on the frequency of osteoporosis, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), or other hypersensitivity reactions in children and neonates exposed to LMWH.\nOBJECTIVES: To assess whether heparin treatment (both unfractionated heparin [UFH] and LMWH) reduces mortality and morbidity rates in preterm and term newborn infants with diagnosed thrombosis. The intervention is compared with placebo or no treatment. Also, to assess the safety of heparin therapy (both UFH and LMWH) for potential harms.Subgroup analyses were planned to examine gestational age, birth weight, mode of thrombus diagnosis, presence of a central line, positive family history for genetic disorders (thrombophilia, deficiency of protein S and protein C, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase [MTHFR] mutation), route of heparin administration, type of heparin used, and location of thrombus (see \"Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity\").\nSEARCH METHODS: We used the standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 4), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to May 9, 2016), Embase (1980 to May 9, 2016), and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL; 1982 to May 9, 2016). We searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomized controlled trials and quasi-randomized trials.\nSELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized, quasi-randomized, and cluster-randomized controlled trials comparing heparin versus placebo or no treatment in preterm and term neonates with a diagnosis of thrombosis.\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used the standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group. Two review authors independently assessed studies identified by the search strategy for inclusion.\nMAIN RESULTS: Our search strategy yielded 1160 references. Two review authors independently assessed all references for inclusion. We found no completed studies and no ongoing trials for inclusion.\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We found no studies that met our inclusion criteria and no evidence from randomized controlled trials to recommend or refute the use of heparin for treatment of neonates with thrombosis.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is an allergic reaction to colonisation of the lungs with the fungus Aspergillus fumigatus and affects around 10% of people with cystic fibrosis. ABPA is associated with an accelerated decline in lung function. High doses of corticosteroids are the main treatment for ABPA; although the long-term benefits are not clear, their many side effects are well-documented. A group of compounds, the azoles, have activity against Aspergillus fumigatus and have been proposed as an alternative treatment for ABPA. Of this group, itraconazole is the most active. A separate antifungal compound, amphotericin B, has been employed in aerosolised form to treat invasive infection with Aspergillus fumigatus, and may have potential for the treatment of ABPA. Antifungal therapy for ABPA in cystic fibrosis needs to be evaluated. This is an update of a previously published review.\nOBJECTIVES: The review aimed to test the hypotheses that antifungal interventions for the treatment of ABPA in cystic fibrosis:1. improve clinical status compared to placebo or standard therapy (no placebo);2. do not have unacceptable adverse effects.If benefit was demonstrated, we aimed to assess the optimal type, duration and dose of antifungal therapy.\nSEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings.In addition, pharmaceutical companies were approached.Date of the most recent search of the Group's Trials Register: 29 September 2016.\nSELECTION CRITERIA: Published or unpublished randomised controlled trials, where antifungal treatments have been compared to either placebo or no treatment, or where different doses of the same treatment have been used in the treatment of ABPA in people with cystic fibrosis.\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Four trials were identified by the searches; none of which was judged eligible for inclusion in the review.\nMAIN RESULTS: No completed randomised controlled trials were included.\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: At present, there are no randomised controlled trials to evaluate the use of antifungal therapies for the treatment of ABPA in people with cystic fibrosis, although trials in people who do not have cystic fibrosis have shown clinical and serological evidence of improvement and a reduction in the use of corticosteroids with no increase in adverse effects. Trials with clear outcome measures are needed to properly evaluate this potentially useful treatment for cystic fibrosis.",

        "abstract": "Platinum agents induce cancer cell death through BCL2-dependent intrinsic apoptotic pathway and are commonly used as anti-tumor drug. In this study, we evaluated whether single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) of BCL2 can affect the overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with platinum-based chemotherapy. We genotyped 48 SNPs of BCL2 gene by Illumina Custom Designed Chip in 972 advanced NSCLC patients treated with platinum-based chemotherapy. We evaluated the relationship between genotype/haplotype/diplotype and OS/PFS by COX regression analysis. As a result, five SNPs, rs949037, rs3810027, rs4987739, rs4987726 and rs7226979, were significantly associated with overall survival time in 972 NSCLC patients after platinum-based chemotherapy. rs1381547 and rs8083946 were associated with progression-free survival. As representative, the G allele of rs949037 was associated with longer OS in NSCLC patients with platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients with GG or AG genotype showed a 19.9 months mOS vs AA genotype 14.2 months mOS (HR: 1.38, 95% CI: 1.11-1.72, p=0.004). In further analysis, rs949037 was found to predominantly contribute to the OS of patients with platinum-tubulin-targeting drugs, moreover, the GG genotype of rs949037 showed an 8.5 months longer OS compared with the unfavorable AA genotype (mOS: 21.36 vs 12.83, HR=0.70, 95% CI: 0.52-0.94, p=0.000). To conclude, polymorphisms of BCL2 gene may have an impact on the OS of platinum-based chemotherapy in NSCLC patients, which may be prognostic biomarkers of chemotherapy if validated in larger studies.",

        "abstract": "Multi-omics methods have greatly advanced our understanding of the biological organism and its microbial associates. However, they are not routinely used in clinical or industrial applications, due to the length of time required to generate and analyze omics data. Here, we applied a novel integrated omics pipeline for the analysis of human and environmental samples in under 48\u00a0h. Human subjects that ferment their own foods provided swab samples from skin, feces, oral cavity, fermented foods, and household surfaces to assess the impact of home food fermentation on their microbial and chemical ecology. These samples were analyzed with 16S rRNA gene sequencing, inferred gene function profiles, and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) metabolomics through the Qiita, PICRUSt, and GNPS pipelines, respectively. The human sample microbiomes clustered with the corresponding sample types in the American Gut Project (http://www.americangut.org), and the fermented food samples produced a separate cluster. The microbial communities of the household surfaces were primarily sourced from the fermented foods, and their consumption was associated with increased gut microbial diversity. Untargeted metabolomics revealed that human skin and fermented food samples had separate chemical ecologies and that stool was more similar to fermented foods than to other sample types. Metabolites from the fermented foods, including plant products such as procyanidin and pheophytin, were present in the skin and stool samples of the individuals consuming the foods. Some food metabolites were modified during digestion, and others were detected in stool intact. This study represents a first-of-its-kind analysis of multi-omics data that achieved time intervals matching those of classic microbiological culturing. IMPORTANCE Polymicrobial infections are difficult to diagnose due to the challenge in comprehensively cultivating the microbes present. Omics methods, such as 16S rRNA sequencing, metagenomics, and metabolomics, can provide a more complete picture of a microbial community and its metabolite production, without the biases and selectivity of microbial culture. However, these advanced methods have not been applied to clinical or industrial microbiology or other areas where complex microbial dysbioses require immediate intervention. The reason for this is the length of time required to generate and analyze omics data. Here, we describe the development and application of a pipeline for multi-omics data analysis in time frames matching those of the culture-based approaches often used for these applications. This study applied multi-omics methods effectively in clinically relevant time frames and sets a precedent toward their implementation in clinical medicine and industrial microbiology.",

        "abstract": "The developmental origins of health and disease (DOHaD) hypothesis states that environmental influences in utero and in early life can determine health and disease in later life through the programming of genes and/or altered gene expression. The DOHaD is likely to have had an effect in South Africa during the fifty years of apartheid; and during the twenty years since the dawn of democracy in 1994. This has profound implications for public health and health promotion policies in South Africa, a country experiencing increased prevalence of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) and risk factors and behaviours for NCDs due to rapid social and economic transition, and because of the DOHaD. Public health policy and health promotion interventions, such as those introduced by the South African Government over the past 20 years, were designed to improve the health of pregnant women (and their unborn children). They could in addition, through the DOHaD mechanism, reduce NCDs and their risk factors in their offspring in later life. The quality of public health data over the past 40 years in South Africa precludes the possibility of proving the DOHaD hypothesis in that context. Nevertheless, public health and health promotion policies need to be strengthened, if South Africa and other low and middle income countries (LMICs) are to avoid the very high prevalence of NCDs seen in Europe and North America in the 50 years following the Second World War, as a result of socio economic transition and the DOHaD.",

Findings have highlighted the limitation of sole reliance on histology, which can be confounded by inter-observer variability. Such studies demonstrate that histologically similar grade IV brain tumors can be divided into four molecular subtypes based on gene expression, with each subtype demonstrating unique genomic aberrations and clinical outcome. These advances indicate that curative therapeutic strategies must now take into account the molecular information in tumor tissue, with the goal of identifying molecularly stratified patients that will most likely to receive treatment benefit from targeted therapy. This in turn spares non-responders from chemotherapeutic side effects and financial costs. In advancing clinical stage drug candidates, the banking of brain tumor tissue necessitates the acquisition of not just tumor tissue with clinical history and robust follow-up, but also high quality molecular information such as somatic mutation, transcriptomic and DNA methylation profiles which have been shown to predict patient survival independent of current clinical indicators. Additionally, the derivation of cell lines from such tumor tissue facilitates the development of clinically relevant patient-derived xenograft mouse models that can prospectively reform the tumor for further studies, yet have retrospective clinical history to associate bench and in vivo findings with clinical data.

        "abstract": "Genetic variations within the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) superfamily of drug metabolizing enzymes confer substantial person-to-person and between-population differences in pharmacokinetics, and by extension, highly variable clinical effects of medicines. In this context, \"personalized medicine,\" \"precision medicine,\" and \"stratified medicine\" are related concepts attributed to what is essentially targeted therapeutics and companion diagnostics, aimed at improving safety and effectiveness of health interventions. We report here, to the best of our knowledge, the first comparative clinical pharmacogenomics study, in an Ecuadorian population sample, of five key CYP450s involved in drug metabolism: CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. In 139 unrelated, medication-free, and healthy Ecuadorian subjects, we measured the phenotypic activity of these drug metabolism pathways using the CEIBA multiplexed phenotyping cocktail. The subjects were genotyped for each CYP450 enzyme gene as well. Notably, based on the CYP450 metabolic phenotypes estimated by the genotype data, 0.75% and 3.10% of the subjects were genotypic poor metabolizers (gPMs) for CYP2C19 and CYP2D6, respectively. Additionally, on the other extreme, genotype-estimated ultrarapid metabolizer (gUMs) phenotype was represented by 15.79% of CYP2C19, and 5.43% of CYP2D6. There was, however, considerable discordance between directly measured phenotypes (mPMs and mUMs) and the above genotype-estimated enzyme phenotypes. For example, among individuals genotypically carrying enhanced activity alleles (gUMs), many showed a lower actual drug metabolism capacity than expected by their genotypes, even lower than individuals with reduced or no activity alleles. In conclusion, for personalized medicine in the Ecuadorian population, we recommend CYP450 multiplexed phenotyping, or genotyping and phenotyping in tandem, rather than CYP450 genotypic tests alone. Additionally, we recommend, in consideration of equity, ethical, and inclusive representation in global science, further precision medicine research and funding in support of neglected or understudied populations worldwide.",

        "abstract": "A blood test that can detect human malignancy with high clinical sensitivity and specificity is highly desirable. To achieve this, a tumor marker is needed that correlates with tumor burden and that can be measured with high analytical sensitivity and specificity. Over the past decades, a number of different types of tumor markers have emerged, including proteins such as enzymes, glycoproteins, and oncofetal antigens. Besides proteins, genetic abnormalities such as mutations, amplifications, and circulating tumor DNA have served as tumor markers. Despite the diversity of such biomarkers, their acceptance and implementation into routine clinical practice requires that their use results in improvements in patient outcome. Current tumor markers used in the clinic have limited utility. As such, innovative approaches to identifying tumor markers are highly desirable and one such approach may be to look for sub-chromosomal changes in the blood of patients with ovarian cancer, as is routinely performed in prenatal screening.Please see related article: http://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-016-0667-6.",

        "abstract": "Up to 30% of people with schizophrenia do not respond to two (or more) trials of dopaminergic antipsychotics. They are said to have treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS). Clozapine is still the only effective treatment for TRS, although it is underused in clinical practice. Initial use is delayed, it can be hard for patients to tolerate, and clinicians can be uncertain as to when to use it. What if, at the start of treatment, we could identify those patients likely to respond to clozapine - and those likely to suffer adverse effects? It is likely that clinicians would feel less inhibited about using it, allowing clozapine to be used earlier and more appropriately. Genetic testing holds out the tantalizing possibility of being able to do just this, and hence the vital importance of pharmacogenomic studies. These can potentially identify genetic markers for both tolerance of and vulnerability to clozapine. We aim to summarize progress so far, possible clinical applications, limitations to the evidence, and problems in applying these findings to the management of TRS. Pharmacogenomic studies of clozapine response and tolerability have produced conflicting results. These are due, at least in part, to significant differences in the patient groups studied. The use of clinical pharmacogenomic testing - to personalize clozapine treatment and identify patients at high risk of treatment failure or of adverse events - has moved closer over the last 20 years. However, to develop such testing that could be used clinically will require larger, multicenter, prospective studies.",

        "abstract": "Despite significant advances in HIV drug treatment regimens, which grant near-normal life expectancies to infected individuals who have good virological control, HIV infection itself remains incurable. In recent years, novel gene- and cell-based therapies have gained increasing attention due to their potential to provide a functional or even sterilizing cure for HIV infection with a one-shot treatment. A functional cure would keep the infection in check and prevent progression to AIDS, while a sterilizing cure would eradicate all HIV viruses from the patient. Genome editing is the most precise form of gene therapy, able to achieve permanent genetic disruption, modification, or insertion at a predesignated genetic locus. The most well-studied candidate for anti-HIV genome editing is CCR5, an essential coreceptor for the majority of HIV strains, and the lack of which confers HIV resistance in naturally occurring homozygous individuals. Genetic disruption of CCR5 to treat HIV has undergone clinical testing, with seven completed or ongoing trials in T cells and hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, and has shown promising safety and potential efficacy profiles. Here we summarize clinical findings of CCR5 editing for HIV therapy, as well as other genome editing-based approaches under pre-clinical development. The anticipated development of more sophisticated genome editing technologies should continue to benefit HIV cure efforts.",

Current pharmacogenomic studies of SCARs have made important strides, as the prevention of SCARs, to some extent, appears attainable with the identification of genetic variants for genes encoding drug-metabolizing enzymes and human leukocyte antigens (HLAs). Despite the improvement of incidence, a treatment guideline for this devastating condition is still unavailable, highlighting the inadequacy of contemporary accepted therapeutic interventions. As such, prompt withdrawal of causative drugs is believed to be a priority of patient management. In this review, we discuss recent cutting-edge findings concerning the discovery of biomarkers for SCARs and their clinical utilities in the better prediction and early diagnosis of this disease. The knowledge compiled herein provides clues for future investigations on deciphering additional genetic markers for SCARs and the design of clinical trials for the prospective identification of subjects at genetic risk for this condition, ultimately personalizing the medicine.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Time in therapeutic range (TTR) is a measurement of quality of warfarin therapy and lower TTR values (<50%) are associated with greater risk of thromboembolic and bleeding events. Recently, we developed a pharmacogenetic-based warfarin dosing algorithm specifically calibrated for a Brazilian patient sample. The aims of this study are: to evaluate the impact of a genetic-based algorithm, compared to traditional anticoagulation, in the time to achieve the therapeutic target and in TTR percentage; and to assess the cost-effectiveness of genotype-guided warfarin dosing in a specific cohort of patients with low TTR (<50%) from a tertiary cardiovascular hospital.\nMETHODS/DESIGN: This study is a randomized controlled trial in patients (n\u2009=\u2009300) with atrial fibrillation with TTR\u2009<\u200950%, based on the last three INR values. At the first consultation, patients will be randomized into two groups: TA group (traditional anticoagulation) and PA group (pharmacogenetic anticoagulation). For the first group, the physician will adjust the dose according to current INR value and, for the second group, a pharmacogenetic algorithm will be used. At the second, third, fourth and fifth consultations (with an interval of 7\u00a0days each) INR will be measured and, if necessary, the dose will be adjusted based on guidelines. Afterwards, patients who are INR stable will begin measuring their INR in 30\u00a0day intervals; if the patient's INR is not stable, the patient will return in 7\u00a0days for a new measurement of the INR. Outcomes measures will include the time to achieve the therapeutic target and the percentage of TTR at 4 and 12\u00a0weeks. In addition, as a secondary end-point, pharmacoeconomic analysis will be carried out. Ethical approval was granted by the Ethics Committee for Medical Research on Human Beings of the Clinical Hospital of the University of S\u00e3o Paulo Medical School.\nDISCUSSION: This randomized study will include patients with low TTR and it will evaluate whether a population-specific genetic algorithm might be more effective than traditional anticoagulation for a selected group of poorly anticoagulated patients.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02592980 .

        "abstract": "Understanding how and why populations evolve is of fundamental importance to molecular ecology. Restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RADseq), a popular reduced representation method, has ushered in a new era of genome-scale research for assessing population structure, hybridization, demographic history, phylogeography and migration. RADseq has also been widely used to conduct genome scans to detect loci involved in adaptive divergence among natural populations. Here, we examine the capacity of those RADseq-based genome scan studies to detect loci involved in local adaptation. To understand what proportion of the genome is missed by RADseq studies, we developed a simple model using different numbers of RAD-tags, genome sizes and extents of linkage disequilibrium (length of haplotype blocks). Under the best-case modelling scenario, we found that RADseq using six- or eight-base pair cutting restriction enzymes would fail to sample many regions of the genome, especially for species with short linkage disequilibrium. We then surveyed recent studies that have used RADseq for genome scans and found that the median density of markers across these studies was 4.08 RAD-tag markers per megabase (one marker per 245\u00a0kb). The length of linkage disequilibrium for many species is one to three orders of magnitude less than density of the typical recent RADseq study. Thus, we conclude that genome scans based on RADseq data alone, while useful for studies of neutral genetic variation and genetic population structure, will likely miss many loci under selection in studies of local adaptation.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Approximately, one-third to one-half of children with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) develop gastrointestinal inflammation characteristic of idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), usually Crohn's disease. We hypothesized that the overall IBD genetic risk, determined by IBD genetic risk score (GRS), might in part determine IBD development in CGD.\nMETHODS: We reviewed medical records to establish IBD diagnoses in CGD subjects seen at NIAID. IBD risk single nucleotide polymorphism genotypes were determined using the Immunochip, and GRS were estimated by Mangrove.\nRESULTS: Among 157 white patients with CGD, 55 were confirmed, 78 excluded, and 24 were uncertain for IBD. Two hundred one established, independent European IBD risk single nucleotide polymorphisms passed quality control. After sample quality control and removing non-IBD CGD patients with perianal disease, mean GRS for 40 unrelated patients with CGD-IBD was higher than 53 CGD non-IBD patients (in log2-scale 0.08 \u00b1 1.62 versus -0.67 \u00b1 1.64, P = 0.026) but lower than 239 IBD Genetics Consortium (IBDGC) young-onset Crohn's disease cases (0.76 \u00b1 1.60, P = 0.025). GRS for non-IBD CGD was similar to 609 IBDGC controls (-0.69 \u00b1 1.60, P = 0.95). Seven established IBD single nucleotide polymorphisms were nominally significant among CGD-IBD versus CGD non-IBD, including those near LACC1 (P = 0.005), CXCL14 (P = 0.007), and TNFSF15 (P = 0.016).\nCONCLUSIONS: The weight of the common IBD risk alleles are significant determinants of IBD in CGD. However, IBD risk gene burden among CGD children with IBD is significantly lower than that in nonsyndromic pediatric Crohn's disease, congruent with the concept that defective superoxide production in CGD is also a major IBD risk factor. Individual IBD genes might interact with the CGD defect to cause IBD in CGD.",

We sought to determine whether a genetic basis contributes to these differences.\nAPPROACH AND RESULTS: We conducted a cluster analysis of 6 subclinical atherosclerosis phenotypes documented in 564 white participants of the Pathobiological Determinants of Atherosclerosis in Youth study including the extent of fatty streaks and raised lesions in the coronary artery (CF and CR), thoracic aorta (TF and TR), and abdominal aorta (AF and AR) followed by a genetic association analysis of the same phenotypes. Our cluster analysis grouped all raised lesions and fatty streaks in the coronary into one cluster (CF, CR, TR, and AR) and the fatty streaks in the aorta into a second cluster (TF and AF). We found a genetic risk score of high-risk alleles at 57 susceptibility loci for CAD to be variably associated with the phenotypes in the first cluster (OR: 1.30 p = 0.009 for being in top quartile of degree of involvement of CF, 1.34 p = 0.005 for CR, 1.25: p = 0.11 for TR, and 1.19 p = 0.08 for AR) but not at all with the phenotypes in the second cluster (OR: 1.01, p = 0.95 for TF and 0.98, p = 0.82 for AF).\nCONCLUSIONS: The genetic determinants of fatty streaks in the aorta do not appear to overlap substantially with the genetic determinants of fatty streaks in the coronary as well as raised lesions in both the coronary and the aorta. These findings may explain why a larger fraction of fatty streaks in the aorta are less likely to progress to raised lesions compared to the coronary artery.",

We distinguish between person-level HTE (i.e. that individuals experience different effects from a treatment) and group-level HTE (i.e. that subgroups have different average treatment effects), and discuss the reference class problem, engendered by the large number of potentially informative subgroupings of a study population (each of which may lead to applying a different estimated effect to the same patient), and the scale dependence of group-level HTE. We also review the limitations of conventional 'one-variable-at-a-time' subgroup analyses and discuss the potential benefits of using more comprehensive subgrouping schemes that incorporate information on multiple variables, such as those based on predicted outcome risk. Understanding the conceptual underpinnings of HTE is critical for understanding how studies can be designed, analysed, and interpreted to better inform individualized clinical decisions.",

PCR analysis was used for genotyping TYMS-TSER. We also evaluated the 5-FU degradation rate, which determines the amount of drug consumed by PBMC in a time unit. Association of these variables with clinical outcome was evaluated using multivariate logistic regression analysis.\nRESULTS: One hundred forty-two patients with early stage colon (39%), rectal (28%), stomach (20%) and pancreatic (13%) cancer, treated with adjuvant capecitabine, were included in this retrospective analysis. Seventy and 20% of the patients suffered from at least one G1-4 and G3-4 adverse events, respectively.

Pedigrees of patients with \u22655 family members with MEN2A were retrospectively reviewed. Analysis was performed among kindreds with the most frequently observed codon mutation (RET 634). Familial MTC disease aggressiveness was evaluated using: (1) mean age at diagnosis of MTC, (2) current mean age of carriers without MTC, (3) proportion of kindred with MTC with metastatic disease at diagnosis, (4) proportion of kindred with MTC with metastasis/death from MTC as worst outcome, and (5) proportion of kindred with disease progression. 170 affected patients from 12 different MEN2A kindreds met inclusion criteria. The number of affected family members available for study per kindred ranged from 8 to 43 individuals.

No differences were noted among kindreds in disease stage at presentation, worst outcome, or progression; marked variation in these measures was noted within families. In conclusion, a difference in age of MTC diagnosis among different RET 634 kindreds was identified. In contrast, notable intra-familial variability in disease aggressiveness was observed.

        "abstract": "The majority of patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) respond to first-line EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), but nearly all inevitably acquire resistance and develop disease progression. Conventional practice would be to switch treatments to second-line therapy. However, continuing TKIs beyond progression is becoming increasingly commonplace in patients with indolent, small volume asymptomatic growth, who may potentially continue to derive ongoing clinical benefit and to avoid a 'withdrawal tumour flare'. Nevertheless, there are limitations to our current criteria for assessing disease response, which are based on radiological assessments without considering symptomatic benefit, or the complex molecular and clinical heterogeneity of tumour growth and drug response patterns. In this article, we review the rationale for continuing EGFR inhibitors in patients with EGFR mutant NSCLC beyond disease progression\u00a0and discuss strategies that have been pursued in the context of molecularly and clinically heterogeneous populations of tumour growth depending on the different clinical scenarios encountered. We discuss the management of systemic disease progression, including continuing EGFR TKIs alone, introducing a drug holiday, or combining TKIs with chemotherapy or other molecularly targeted agents. We also focus on approaches in managing patients with indolent, small volume asymptomatic growth (non-CNS oligometastatic disease progression) and those with oligometastatic EGFR mutant NSCLC with involvement of the central nervous system. We envision future precision medicine strategies through the use of next generation sequencing strategies of serial tumour rebiopsies and circulating plasma DNA to individualise the management for such patients during disease progression.",

We compared the prevalence of IBD family history and history of ileal involvement, CD-related surgeries and IBD medications in China and the United States, adjusting for potential confounders.\nRESULTS: We recruited 49 participants from China and 145 from the United States. The prevalence of family history of IBD was significantly lower in China compared with the United States (China: 4.1%, United States: 39.3%). The three most commonly affected types of relatives were cousin, sibling, and parent in the United States compared with child and sibling in China. Ileal involvement (China: 63.3%, United States: 63.5%) and surgery for CD (China: 51.0%, United States: 49.7%) were nearly equivalent in the two countries.\nCONCLUSION: The lower prevalence of familial clustering of IBD in China may suggest that the etiology of CD is less attributed to genetic background or a family-shared environment compared with the United States. Despite the potential difference in etiology, surgery and ileal involvement were similar in the two countries. Examining the changes in family history during the continuing rise in IBD may provide further insight into the etiology of CD.",

Furthermore, several genetic abnormalities associated with HCM have been identified. However, the genotype-phenotype correlation in HCM remains to be elucidated. Here, we attempted to assess patients with different types of gene mutations causing HCM and investigate the prognosis. A total of 140 patients with HCM underwent a screening test for myofilament gene mutations by direct sequencing of eight sarcomeric genes. Patients with a single mutation in cardiac troponin T, cardiac troponin I, \u03b1-tropomyosin, and regulatory and essential light chains were excluded from the study because the number of cases was too small. The clinical presentations and outcomes of the remaining 127 patients with HCM, 31 \u03b2-myosin heavy chain (MYH7) mutation carriers, 19 cardiac myosin-binding protein C (MYBPC3) mutation carriers, and 77 mutation non-carriers were analyzed retrospectively. MYBPC3 mutation carriers had a high frequency of ventricular arrhythmia and syncope. Kaplan-Meier curves revealed no significant difference in prognosis among the three groups, but a lack of family history of sudden death (SD) and a past history of syncope were significantly related to poor prognosis. An absence of family history of SD and past history of syncope are useful prognostic factors in patients with HCM. MYH7 and MYBPC3 mutations did not significantly influence prognosis compared to non-carriers. However, patients with the MYBPC3 mutation should be closely followed for the possibility of SD.",

The presence of features of CS in the general unaffected population results in difficulties in the recognition and diagnosis of this condition. Early diagnosis is essential to prevent the development of malignant neoplasms, yet despite the introduction of diagnostic criteria and risk calculators, accurate diagnosis remains a challenge. We identified three patients who presented to the symptomatic breast unit of a University Teaching Hospital over a period of 12 weeks who subsequently were diagnosed with CS. In this article, we discuss their clinical presentations as well as their path to diagnosis. The short timeframe between the presentations of these patients undoubtedly expedited their diagnosis. Upon application of internationally recognized diagnostic criteria, only two out of our three patients were accurately diagnosed. The risk of breast cancer in CS is comparable with that found in Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer Syndrome and while a protocol for breast screening in these patients exists in most centres, no such protocol exists for patients with CS in our institution. The recommended cancer surveillance programs for patients with CS have not been found to prolong survival, however. CS consists of a vast array of diseases that span the various specialties and the subsequent varied phenotypic presentation poses diagnostic difficulties for clinicians as emphasized in our series. Continued research is required to improve recognition and diagnosis and will hopefully result in the emergence of life prolonging strategies.",

        "abstract": "Publicly available multi-omic databases, in particular if associated with medical annotations, are rich resources with the potential to lead a rapid transition from high-throughput molecular biology experiments to better clinical outcomes for patients. In this work, we propose a model for multi-omic data integration (i.e., genetic variations, gene expression, genome conformation, and epigenetic patterns), which exploits a multi-layer network approach to analyse, visualize, and obtain insights from such biological information, in order to use achieved results at a macroscopic level. Using this representation, we can describe how driver and passenger mutations accumulate during the development of diseases providing, for example, a tool able to characterize the evolution of cancer. Indeed, our test case concerns the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line, before and after the stimulation with estrogen, since many datasets are available for this case study. In particular, the integration of data about cancer mutations, gene functional annotations, genome conformation, epigenetic patterns, gene expression, and metabolic pathways in our multi-layer representation will allow a better interpretation of the mechanisms behind a complex disease such as cancer. Thanks to this multi-layer approach, we focus on the interplay of chromatin conformation and cancer mutations in different pathways, such as metabolic processes, that are very important for tumor development. Working on this model, a variance analysis can be implemented to identify normal variations within each omics and to characterize, by contrast, variations that can be accounted to pathological samples compared to normal ones. This integrative model can be used to identify novel biomarkers and to provide innovative omic-based guidelines for treating many diseases, improving the efficacy of decision trees currently used in clinic.",

Dissecting their genetic architecture requires continued development of innovative and powerful statistical methods. Corresponding advances in computing tools are critical to efficiently use these statistical innovations and to enhance and accelerate biomedical and agricultural research and applications. The genome association and prediction integrated tool (GAPIT) was first released in 2012 and became widely used for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and genomic prediction. The GAPIT implemented computationally efficient statistical methods, including the compressed mixed linear model (CMLM) and genomic prediction by using genomic best linear unbiased prediction (gBLUP). New state-of-the-art statistical methods have now been implemented in a new, enhanced version of GAPIT. These methods include factored spectrally transformed linear mixed models (FaST-LMM), enriched CMLM (ECMLM), FaST-LMM-Select, and settlement of mixed linear models under progressively exclusive relationship (SUPER). The genomic prediction methods implemented in this new release of the GAPIT include gBLUP based on CMLM, ECMLM, and SUPER. Additionally, the GAPIT was updated to improve its existing output display features and to add new data display and evaluation functions, including new graphing options and capabilities, phenotype simulation, power analysis, and cross-validation. These enhancements make the GAPIT a valuable resource for determining appropriate experimental designs and performing GWAS and genomic prediction. The enhanced R-based GAPIT software package uses state-of-the-art methods to conduct GWAS and genomic prediction. The GAPIT also provides new functions for developing experimental designs and creating publication-ready tabular summaries and graphs to improve the efficiency and application of genomic research.",

Given that several more genes have now been implicated in hereditary breast cancer syndromes, there is increased clinical use of multigene panel testing to evaluate patients with a suspected genetic predisposition to breast cancer. While this is most certainly a cost-effective approach, broader testing strategies have resulted in a higher likelihood of identifying moderate-penetrance genes, for which management guidelines regarding breast cancer risk reduction have not been firmly established. In addition, the testing of more genes has led to increased detection of variants of uncertain significance. We review the current knowledge regarding both high- and moderate-risk hereditary breast cancer syndromes, as well as additional genes implicated in hereditary breast cancer for which there is limited data. Furthermore, strategies for cancer risk reduction in mutation carriers as well as therapeutic implications for those patients who harbor pathogenic germline alterations are discussed.",

        "abstract": "Multigene assays that simultaneously measure the expression of various breast cancer genes have been developed to guide the use of adjuvant chemotherapy in early breast cancer. The efficacy of adjuvant therapies depends on the recurrence risk for an individual patient. As a result, accurate prediction of the recurrence risk is vital for precise adjuvant chemotherapy in individual breast cancer patients. The recurrence risk as typically assessed by conventional examination of histological data of immuno-histological biomarkers(ER, PR, HER2, and Ki-67)is not sufficient to select subsets of patients. Therefore, validated gene expression signatures are useful, in addition to well-established clinico-pathological factors. Available gene expression assay systems, such as MammaPrint\u00ae, Oncotype DX\u00ae, PAM50 ROR, GGI, EndoPredict\u00ae(EP), Breast Cancer IndexSM(BCI), and Curebest\u00ae95GC Breast, are recommended. While MammaPrint\u00aeand Oncotype DX\u00aeare the most predictive of the recurrence risk within the first 5 years of diagnosis, BCI and EPclin have demonstrated utility in predicting late recurrence. In addition, PAM50 provides further biological insights by classifying breast cancers into intrinsic molecular subtypes. These gene expression signatures have become important tools in clinical practice for the identification of low-risk endocrine-positive patients in whom chemotherapy could be avoided. However, there is much work left in the development of a molecular classification considering the biology and novel therapeutic targets in high-risk recurrent disease because chemotherapy has only modest benefits in this population. The recognition of genomic mutations and their relationship to a patient's responsiveness to various therapies will provide important breakthroughs toward precision medicine.",

However, we cannot predict currently which new presentations of Crohn's disease are destined to develop severe disease so treatment cannot be targeted to the most appropriate patients. Accordingly, via systematic review and meta-analysis we aim to identify if biomarkers of disease activity are able to predict development of severe disease.\nMETHODS/DESIGN: We will search the primary literature and conference proceedings for studies of biomarkers of all types including clinical, endoscopic, radiological, faecal, urinary, serological, genetic, and histological. Precise definition of \"severe\" disease is elusive so we will include sensitivity analysis to account for different definitions. We will use the CHARMS checklist to frame our question and to extract data. We will extract the study design, setting, participant characteristics, biomarker(s) investigated, and study outcomes. Bias will be assessed via the PROBAST tool. We will present the results using narrative and graphical methods. We will present the summary by meta-analysis where there are sufficient studies with reasonable homogeneity, using methods appropriate to the type of data extracted. Heterogeneity will be presented via Forest and ROC plots.\nDISCUSSION: If this systematic review and meta-analysis identifies biomarkers that appear sufficiently predictive for subsequent severe disease course, we aim to combine them in a predictive model, followed by external validation using individual patient data. A predictive model able to identify new presentations of Crohn's disease destined to develop severe disease subsequently would have considerable clinical utility for patient management.\nSYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: PROSPERO CRD42016029363 .",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In spite of significant improvement after multi-modality treatment, prognosis of most patients with glioblastoma remains poor. Standard clinical prognostic factors (age, gender, extent of surgery and performance status) do not clearly predict long-term survival. The aim of this case-control study was to evaluate immuno-histochemical and genetic characteristics of the tumour as additional prognostic factors in glioblastoma.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: Long-term survivor group were 40 patients with glioblastoma with survival longer than 30 months. Control group were 40 patients with shorter survival and matched to the long-term survivor group according to the clinical prognostic factors. All patients underwent multimodality treatment with surgery, postoperative conformal radiotherapy and temozolomide during and after radiotherapy. Biopsy samples were tested for the methylation of MGMT promoter (with methylation specific polymerase chain reaction), IDH1 (with immunohistochemistry), IDH2, CDKN2A and CDKN2B (with multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification), and 1p and 19q mutations (with fluorescent in situ hybridization).\nRESULTS: Methylation of MGMT promoter was found in 95% and in 36% in the long-term survivor and control groups, respectively (p < 0.001). IDH1 R132H mutated patients had a non-significant lower risk of dying from glioblastoma (p = 0.437), in comparison to patients without this mutation. Other mutations were rare, with no significant difference between the two groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: Molecular and genetic testing offers additional prognostic and predictive information for patients with glioblastoma. The most important finding of our analysis is that in the absence of MGMT promoter methylation, longterm survival is very rare. For patients without this mutation, alternative treatments should be explored.",

A clonal mutation in a patient with cytopenias and a nondiagnostic bone marrow may indicate a syndrome with a similar natural history to MDS, but at present there are no clear criteria to distinguish cytopenias coincidentally seen in association with an unrelated clonal mutation from cytopenias that are directly caused by that mutation.

Among them, 247 interviewees (6.3%) experienced GHD and 120 (3.1%) experienced GDM. In a multivariable analysis adjusted for age, obstetric, and gynecologic variables, age at the first pregnancy over 35 years (adjusted OR 1.61, 95% CI 1.02-2.43) and FHpCVD (adjusted OR 1.60, 95% CI 1.16-2.22) were risk factors for GHD in individuals, whereas FHH was not. FHDM and history of infertility therapy were risk factors for GDM in individuals (adjusted OR 2.68, 95% CI 1.86-3.86; 1.84, 95% CI 1.05-3.23, respectively). In any repeated pregnancies in an individual, age at the current pregnancy and at the first pregnancy, and FHpCVD were risk factors for GHD, while age at the current pregnancy, history of infertility therapy, and FHDM were risk factors for GDM.\nCONCLUSIONS: The FHpCVD and FHDM are significantly associated with GHD and GDM, respectively. Meticulous family histories should be obtained, and women with family histories of these conditions should be carefully monitored during pregnancy.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: We investigated the prevalence of Lynch syndrome and Lynch-like syndrome among Japanese colorectal cancer patients, as there have been no credible data from Japan.\nMETHODS: Immunohistochemical analyses for mismatch repair proteins (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2) were carried out in surgically resected, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens obtained from 1,234 newly diagnosed colorectal cancer patients between March 2005 and April 2014. The presence/absence of the BRAF V600E mutation and hypermethylation of the MLH1 promoter was analyzed where necessary. Genetic testing was finally undertaken in patients suspected as having Lynch syndrome.\nRESULTS: By the universal screening approach with immunohistochemical analysis for mismatch repair proteins followed by analyses for the BRAF V600E mutation and MLH1 promoter methylation status, 11 (0.9%) of the 1,234 patients were identified as candidates for genetic testing. Out of the 11 patients, 9 (0.7%) were finally diagnosed as having Lynch syndrome; the responsible genes included MLH1 (n = 1), MSH2 (n = 4), EPCAM (n = 1) and MSH6 (n = 3). The remaining two patients (0.2%) were regarded as having Lynch-like syndrome, since biallelic somatic deletion of the relevant mismatch repair genes was detected in the absence of germline mismatch repair alterations. None of the cases was identified as having germline MLH1 epimutation.\nCONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of Lynch syndrome among all newly diagnosed cases of colorectal cancer in Japan is in the same range as that recently reported by studies in Western population. The prevalence of Lynch-like syndrome seems to be extremely low.",

The phenotype ranges from asymptomatic individuals to sudden cardiac arrest and death. LQTS is a rare but significant health problem for which global data should exist. This study sought to provide the first clinical and genetic description of Australian families with LQTS.\nMETHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study to evaluate clinical and genetic features of families with LQTS. We recruited individuals from the Australian Genetic Heart Disease Registry and Genetic Heart Disease Clinic, in Sydney, Australia, and included those with a diagnosis of LQTS according to the most recent consensus statement.\nRESULTS: Among 108 families with LQTS, 173 individuals were affected. Twenty-five (32%) probands had a sudden cardiac death (SCD) event (including appropriate implantable cardioverter defibrillator [ICD] therapy, or resuscitated cardiac arrest). There were 64 (82%) probands who underwent genetic testing, and 34 (53%) had a pathogenic or likely pathogenic mutation in. Having a family history of LQTS was significantly associated with identification of a pathogenic result (79% versus 14%, p&lt;0.0001). There were 16 (9%) participants who experienced delay to diagnosis of at least 12 months.\nCONCLUSIONS: This is the first clinical and genetic study in a large cohort of Australian families with LQTS. Findings from this study suggest that the clinical and genetic features in this population are not dissimilar to those described in North American, European, and Asian cohorts. Global-scale information about families with LQTS is an important initiative to ensure diagnostic and management approaches are applicable to different populations and ethnicities.",

Chromosome karyotype analyses were performed by the peripheral blood chromosome G-band detection method. Screening of Y chromosome microdeletions of azoospermia factor (AZF) region was performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of 11 sequence-tagged sites (STS). The serum levels of follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinising hormone and testosterone (T) and the appearance of scrotal ultrasound were also obtained. In 286 cases of NOA, 14.3% were found to have chromosomal alterations. The incidence of chromosomal abnormality was 2.8%. Sex chromosomal abnormalities were seen in six cases (four cases of Klinefelter's syndrome (47, XXY) and two cases of mosaics). The incidence of polymorphic chromosomal variants was 3% in the normal group and 11.5% in the NOA group. In total, 15.7% of NOA patients were found to have AZF microdeletions and AZF (c\u00a0+\u00a0d) was the most frequent one. The results of hormone and SR were found to be significantly different among all testicular histological types, whereas no significant differences were found when it comes to genetic alterations. It is concluded that the rate of cytogenetic alterations was high in NOA patients. So screening for chromosomal alterations and AZF microdeletions would add useful information for genetic counselling in NOA patients with testis biopsy and avoid vertical transmission of genetic defects by assisted\u00a0reproductive\u00a0technology.",

Lithium (Li) represents the mainstay treatment for BD, although a significant proportion of patients shows insufficient or no response. Li is also associated with potentially severe side effects, including renal effects. Several studies reported that Li may induce reduction of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in patients under long-term treatment. The biological systems and the genetic factors involved in susceptibility to Li-induced renal-side effects have been scarcely explored. The aim of our study was to test the contribution of putatively risk genetic variants in Li-induced reduction in estimated GFR (eGFR) in BD patients under long-term Li treatment. Tag SNPs, located in genes previously shown to be associated with kidney dysfunction or Li mechanism of action, were selected and genotyped in a sample of 70 BD patients of Sardinian origin. SNP rs378448, located in Acid Sensing Ion Channel Neurona-1 (ACCN1) gene, showed a significant interaction with duration of Li treatment on eGFR (F<sub>2</sub>=3.623, p=0.033).

Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is an aggressive cancer with a high incidence rate and low survival rate. Current therapies are often aggressive and carry considerable side effects. Much research now indicates that precision medicine can be used for HNSCC and may achieve improved results. From this perspective, we present an overview of the current status, potential strategies, and challenges of precision medicine in HNSCC. We focus on targeted therapy based on cell the surface signaling receptors epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2), and on the PI3K/AKT/mTOR, JAK/STAT3 and RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK cellular signaling pathways.

        "abstract": "This study aimed to characterize women at-risk for hereditary BC regarding their clinical and molecular characteristics (mutation and methylation in the BRCA1 gene) and correlate the gene expression levels with histopathological, clinical and family history information. BRCA1 real time qPCR was performed to evaluate methylation status and gene expression. The study included 88 women grouped according to the BRCA1 mutational status: 23 BRCA1 mutated, 22 with a Variant of Unknown Significance (VUS) in BRCA1 and 43 BRCA1 WT. Most BRCA1 mutated tumors were triple negative (69.6%) and had histologic grade III (61.0%). Patients with VUS/WT BRCA1 were predominantly of luminal B subtype with histological grades I and II. Regarding the methylation profile, BRCA1 hypermethylation was observed in only two patients (both WT) and none had association with pathogenic BRCA1 mutation. In one patient methylation was present in both, tumor and normal tissues. Hypermethylated tumors had ductal histology, negativity for ER and occurred in < 50 years patients. Gene expression profile showed in all groups lower BRCA1 mRNA levels in tumor tissue compared to the adjacent breast tissue, thereby indicating the loss/decrease of gene function. No association was found between the levels of BRCA1 gene expression and family history of cancer. In summary, our findings suggested that methylation at the BRCA1 gene is not the \"second\" event in the development of BC in patients with germline mutations in BRCA1 and, although rare, BRCA1 epimutations can constitute an explanation for a fraction of HBOC families.",

Defects in carnitine transport such as those caused by defective activity of the OCTN2 transporter encoded by the SLC22A5 gene result in primary carnitine deficiency, and newborn screening programmes can identify patients at risk for this condition before irreversible damage. Initial biochemical diagnosis can be confirmed through molecular testing, although direct study of carnitine transport in fibroblasts is very useful to confirm or exclude primary carnitine deficiency in individuals with genetic variations of unknown clinical significance or who continue to have low levels of carnitine despite negative molecular analyses. Genetic defects in carnitine biosynthesis do not generally result in low plasma levels of carnitine. However, deletion of the trimethyllysine hydroxylase gene, a key gene in carnitine biosynthesis, has been associated with non-dysmorphic autism. Thus, new roles for carnitine are emerging that are unrelated to classic inborn errors of metabolism.",

However, the general picture and mutational spectrum of FH in China are far from recognized, representing a missed opportunity for the investigation.\nAPPROACH AND RESULTS: A total of 8050 patients undergoing coronary angiography were enrolled. The diagnosis of clinical FH was made using Dutch Lipid Clinic Network criteria, and the information of relatives was obtained by inquiring for the probands or from their own medical records of certain clinics/hospitals. Molecular analysis of FH was performed using target exome sequencing in LDLR (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol receptor gene), APOB (apolipoprotein B gene), and PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 gene). As a result, 3.5% of the patients with definite/probable FH phenotype (definite 1.0% and probable 2.5%) were identified. Women FH had fewer premature coronary artery disease (women &lt;60, or men &lt;55 years of age) when compared with men FH (70.6% versus 82.7%; P&lt;0.001), whereas angiographic extension of coronary artery disease was significantly increased with FH diagnosis in both men and women (P&lt;0.001).

To what extent genetic versus nongenetic factors account for this difference is unknown.Methods: Using logistic regression, we evaluated the interactive influences of established risk factors and ethnicity (self-identified and identified by ancestral informative markers) on breast cancer risk among 2,326 Hispanic and 1,854 NHW postmenopausal women from the United States and Mexico in the Breast Cancer Health Disparities Study.Results: The inverse association between the percentage of Native American (NA) ancestry and breast cancer risk was only slightly attenuated after adjusting for known risk factors [lowest versus highest quartile: odds ratio (OR) =1.39, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.00-1.92 among U.S. Hispanics; OR = 1.92 (95% CI, 1.29-2.86) among Mexican women]. The prevalence of several risk factors, as well as the associations with certain factors and breast cancer risk, differed according to genetic admixture. For example, higher body mass index (BMI) was associated with reduced risk among women with lower NA ancestry only [BMI &lt;25 versus &gt;30: OR = 0.65 (95% CI, 0.44-0.98) among U.S. Hispanics; OR = 0.53 (95% CI, 0.29-0.97) among Mexicans]. The average number of risk factors among cases was inversely related to the percentage of NA ancestry.Conclusions: The lower NA ancestry groups were more likely to have the established risk factors, with the exception of BMI. Although the majority of factors were associated with risk in the expected directions among all women, BMI had an inverse association among Hispanics with lower NA ancestry.Impact: These data suggest that the established risk factors are less relevant for breast cancer development among women with more NA ancestry.

We investigate whether PITX2 methylation is feasible for individualized risk assessment in prostate core biopsies before surgery. A quantitative, methylation-specific real-time PCR was used to measure PITX2 in three cohorts: i) matched samples of neoplastic and nonneoplastic tissue from 24 patients with PCa, ii) a well-characterized cohort of 300 patients with PCa after radical prostatectomy, and iii) core biopsy specimens from 32 patients with PCa and 31 patients with benign prostatic disease. PITX2 methylation discriminated between neoplastic and nonneoplastic tissue in patients with PCa (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). In the second cohort, PITX2 methylation significantly correlated with clinicopathologic parameters, and PITX2 hypermethylation predicted an increased risk of biochemical recurrence in univariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis (hazard ratio, 1.77; P\u00a0=\u00a00.046) and Kaplan-Meier analysis (P\u00a0=\u00a00.043). In 753 prostate biopsies, 720 (95.6%) were applicable for analysis, rendering the assay feasible for diagnostic biopsies. PITX2 methylation was furthermore significantly increased in tumor-positive biopsies and strongly correlated with International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grade groups. This study indicates that the PITX2 methylation assay is feasible in prostate biopsies and might add valuable prognostic information for risk assessment in a presurgical diagnostic setting.",

However, liability has a symmetric but distinct aspect to risk, resistance to disorder. Resistance factors, aggregated at the low end of the liability distribution and supporting health and recovery, appear to be more promising for effective prevention and intervention. Herein, we discuss existing work on resistance factors, highlighting those with known genetic influences. We examine the utility of incorporating resistance genetics in prevention and intervention trials and compare the statistical power of a series of ascertainment schemes to develop a general framework for examining resistance outcomes in genetically informative designs. We find that an approach that samples individuals discordant on measured liability, a low-risk design, is the most feasible design and yields power equivalent to or higher than commonly used designs for detecting resistance genetic and environmental effects.",

The study was performed in a population-based cohort of 1016 elderly individuals, which comprised 168 statin users investigated at age 75 and 80. Using random forest models, the major variants influencing LDL-C levels were summarized in a weighted GRS (wGRS).

Four SNPs within the APOE cluster (rs7412, rs4420638), ABCC2 (rs2002042) and CELSR/SORT1/PSRC1 (rs646776), displayed a major impact on statin efficacy. The wGRS was significantly associated with lower LDL-C at age 75 and 80. This association was replicated displaying similar results.

        "abstract": "BRCA1/2-associated breast cancers are sensitive to poly(ADPribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors and platinum compounds mainly due to their deficiency in DNA repair via homologous recombination (HR). However, approximately only 15% of triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) are BRCA1/2-associated. TNBCs that exhibit BRCAness (a phenotype reflecting impaired HR in BRCA1/2-negative tumors) are also regarded sensitive to PARP inhibitors and platinum compounds. Thus, we hypothesized that hereditary BRCA1/2-negative TNBCs may exhibit BRCAness. To find a subset of hereditary BRCA1/2-negative TNBCs among 360 TNBCs, we first identified a group of 41 hereditary TNBCs by analyzing the family histories of the patients. Next, we tested this group for the presence of germline BRCA1/2 mutations, and finally, we compared the expression levels of 120 genes involved in HR and five other major mechanisms of DNA damage repair between BRCA1/2-associated and BRCA1/2-negative subgroups of hereditary TNBCs using real-time PCR arrays. Approximately 73% of the hereditary TNBCs were BRCA1/2-associated and 27% were BRCA1/2-negative. The expression levels of the analyzed genes showed no significant differences between these two subgroups indicating the BRCAness of the BRCA1/2-negative hereditary TNBCs and thereby distinguishing a novel subset of TNBCs as a potential target for PARP inhibitors or platinum-based therapy. The results show the significance of family history in selecting patients with TNBC for therapies directed at incompetent DNA repair (e.g., PARP inhibitors and/or platinum-based therapies) and indicate that a relatively simple strategy for broadening the target group for these modes of treatment is to identify patients with hereditary TNBCs.",

        "abstract": "Although prion diseases are generally thought to present as rapidly progressive dementias with survival of only a few months, the phenotypic spectrum for genetic prion diseases (gPrDs) is much broader. The majority have a rapid decline with short survival, but many patients with gPrDs present as slowly progressive ataxic or parkinsonian disorders with progression over a few to several years. A few very rare mutations even present as neuropsychiatric disorders, sometimes with systemic symptoms such as gastrointestinal disorders and neuropathy, progressing over years to decades. gPrDs are caused by mutations in the prion protein gene (PRNP), and have been historically classified based on their clinicopathological features as genetic Jakob-Creutzfeldt disease (gJCD), Gerstmann-Str\u00e4ussler-Scheinker (GSS), or Fatal Familial Insomnia (FFI). Mutations in PRNP can be missense, nonsense, and octapeptide repeat insertions or a deletion, and present with diverse clinical features, sensitivities of ancillary testing, and neuropathological findings. We present the UCSF gPrD cohort, including 129 symptomatic patients referred to and/or seen at UCSF between 2001 and 2016, and compare the clinical features of the gPrDs from 22 mutations identified in our cohort with data from the literature, as well as perform a literature review on most other mutations not represented in our cohort. E200K is the most common mutation worldwide, is associated with gJCD, and was the most common in the UCSF cohort. Among the GSS-associated mutations, P102L is the most commonly reported and was also the most common at UCSF. We also had several octapeptide repeat insertions (OPRI), a rare nonsense mutation (Q160X), and three novel mutations (K194E, E200G, and A224V) in our UCSF cohort. \u00a9 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a clinically complex and very heterogeneous disease at the molecular level. Conventional cytogenetic analysis and FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization) tests provide important information about the biological and clinical background of the disease and enable the classification of AML patients into three risk groups. However, up to half of patients have normal cytogenetics. Determining prognosis and treatment strategies in this group of patients is challenging. The development of molecular genetic methods, including next generation sequencing in the last decade, has led to the discovery of a number of recurrent mutations that have contributed to increasing the accuracy of prognosis of those patients with cytogenetically normal AML. Besides the prognostic value of these mutations, they may also be used to monitor minimal residual disease during and after treatment of AML and additionally constitute potential targets for the development of new therapeutic agents. The importance of molecular genetic testing of all patients with AML is highlighted by the WHO classification of 2008 in which subgroups of AML are purely defined by molecular genetics markers.\nAIM: In this article, we provide an overview of the most significant mutations in patients with cytogenetically normal AML. We describe their significance for prognosis, their importance in monitoring minimal residual disease, and their potential for the development of new targeted therapies. Further, we briefly draw attention to the significance of gene mutation accumulation in clonal disease development and how it affects the time of AML relapse.",

As part of a large randomized controlled trial, this qualitative study examined women's experiences of using the Breast RECONstruction Decision Aid (BRECONDA) and health professionals' feedback regarding the impact of this resource on patients' knowledge and decision making about breast reconstruction.\nMETHOD: Semistructured interviews were conducted with women who accessed the BRECONDA intervention (N\u00a0=\u00a036) and with their healthcare providers (N\u00a0=\u00a06). All interviews were transcribed verbatim and subjected to thematic analysis by 3 independent coders.\nRESULTS: Participants reported an overall positive impression, with all interviewees endorsing this decision aid as a useful resource for women considering reconstructive surgery. Thematic analysis of patient interviews revealed 4 themes: overall impressions and aesthetics; personal relevance and utility; introducing BRECONDA; and advantages and suggested improvements. Analysis of health professionals' interviews also revealed 4 themes: need for BRECONDA, impact of BRECONDA, potential difficulties that may arise in using the decision aid, and recommending BRECONDA to patients. Patients indicated that they derived benefit from this resource at all stages of their decision-making process, with the greatest perceived benefit being for those early in their breast reconstruction journey.\nCONCLUSION: These findings support the use of BRECONDA as an adjunct to clinical consultation and other information sources.",

Goals included identifying cancer prevention research opportunities offering the highest return on investment, exploring the concept of precision prevention and what is needed to advance this area of research, and identifying possible targets for prevention. Four study populations were considered for cancer prevention research: healthy people, those at increased risk for a specific cancer, people with preneoplastic lesions, and children, adolescents, and young adults. Priorities that emerged include screening (e.g., surveillance intervals, tomosynthesis vs. digital mammography), a pre-cancer genome atlas (PreTCGA), HPV vaccines, immunoprevention of noninfectious origins, and overdiagnosis. Challenges exist, as the priority list is ambitious and potentially expensive. Clinical trials need to be carefully designed to include and maximize prospective tissue collection. Exploring existing cofunding mechanisms will likely be necessary. Finally, relationships with a new generation of physician specialists will need to be cultivated to reach the target populations.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: African-Caribbeans in the UK have the highest schizophrenia incidence and greatest inequity in access to mental health services of all ethnic groups. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) highlights this crisis in care and urgent need to improve evidence-based mental healthcare, experiences of services and outcomes for this group. Family intervention (FI) is clinically and cost-effective for the management of schizophrenia but it is rarely offered. Evidence for FI with minority ethnic groups generally, and African-Caribbeans in particular, is lacking. This study aims to test the feasibility and acceptability of delivering Culturally-adapted Family Intervention (CaFI) to African-Caribbean service users diagnosed with schizophrenia.\nMETHODS/DESIGN: This is a feasibility cohort design study. Over a 12-month intervention period, 30 service users and their families, recruited from hospital and community settings, will receive ten one-hourly sessions of CaFI. Where biological families are absent, access to the intervention will be optimised through 'family support members'; trusted individuals nominated by service users or study volunteers. We shall collect data on eligibility, uptake, retention and attrition and assess the utility and feasibility of collecting various outcome measures including readmission, service engagement, working alliance, clinical symptoms and functioning, perceived criticism, psychosis knowledge, familial stress and economic costs. Measures will be collected at baseline, post-intervention and at 3-month follow-up using validated questionnaires and standardised interviews. Admission rates and change in care management will be rated by independent case note examination. Variability in the measures will inform sample size estimates for a future trial. Independent raters will assess fidelity to the intervention in 10\u00a0% of sessions. Feedback at the end of each session along with thematically-analysed qualitative interviews will examine CaFI's acceptability to service users, families and healthcare professionals.\nDISCUSSION: This innovative response to inequalities in mental healthcare experienced by African-Caribbeans diagnosed with schizophrenia might improve engagement in services, access to evidence-based interventions and clinical outcomes. Successful implementation of CaFI in this group could pave the way for better engagement and provision across marginalised groups and therefore has potentially important implications for commissioning and service delivery in ethnically diverse populations. This study will demonstrate whether the approach is feasible and acceptable and can be implemented with fidelity in different settings.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Despite advances in next generation DNA sequencing (NGS), NGS-based single gene tests for diagnostic purposes require improvements in terms of completeness, quality, speed, and cost. Single-molecule molecular inversion probes (smMIPs) are a technology with unrealized potential in the area of clinical genetic testing. In this proof-of-concept study, we selected 2 frequently requested gene tests, those for the breast cancer genes BRCA1 and BRCA2, and developed an automated work flow based on smMIPs.\nMETHODS: The BRCA1 and BRCA2 smMIPs were validated using 166 human genomic DNA samples with known variant status. A generic automated work flow was built to perform smMIP-based enrichment and sequencing for BRCA1, BRCA2, and the checkpoint kinase 2 (CHEK2) c.1100del variant.\nRESULTS: Pathogenic and benign variants were analyzed in a subset of 152 previously BRCA-genotyped samples, yielding an analytical sensitivity and specificity of 100%. Following automation, blind analysis of 65 in-house samples and 267 Norwegian samples correctly identified all true-positive variants (>3000), with no false positives. Consequent to process optimization, turnaround times were reduced by 60% to currently 10-15 days. Copy number variants were detected with an analytical sensitivity of 100% and an analytical specificity of 88%.\nCONCLUSIONS: smMIP-based genetic testing enables automated and reliable analysis of the coding sequences of BRCA1 and BRCA2. The use of single-molecule tags, double-tiled targeted enrichment, and capturing and sequencing in duplo, in combination with automated library preparation and data analysis, results in a robust process and reduces routine turnaround times. Furthermore, smMIP-based copy number variation analysis could make independent copy number variation tools like multiplex ligation-dependent probes amplification dispensable.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Roughly half of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) cases are Lynch syndrome and exhibit germ-line mutations in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes; the other half are familial colorectal cancer (CRC) type X (FCCTX) and are MMR proficient. About 70% of Lynch syndrome tumors have germ-line MLH1 or MSH2 mutations. The clinical presentation, histopathological features, and carcinogenesis of FCCTX resemble those of sporadic MMR-proficient colorectal tumors. It is of interest to obtain biomarkers that distinguish FCCTX from sporadic microsatellite stable (MSS) CRC, to develop preventive strategies.\nMETHODS: The tumors and adjacent normal tissues of 40 patients with HNPCC were assayed using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation27 (HM27) BeadChip to assess the DNA methylation level at about 27,000 loci. The germ-line mutation status of MLH1 and MSH2 and the microsatellite instability status in these patients were obtained. Genome-wide DNA methylation measurements of three groups of patients with general CRC were downloaded from public domain databases. Probes with DNA methylation levels that differed significantly between patients with sporadic MSS CRC and FCCTX were examined, to explore their potential as biomarkers.\nRESULTS: We found that MSS HNPCC tumors were overwhelmingly hypomethylated compared with those from patient groups with other types of CRC, including germ-line MLH1/MSH2-mutated HNPCC and sporadic MSS CRC. Five gene-marker panels that exhibited a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity higher than 90% in both discovery and validation cohorts were proposed to distinguish MSS HNPCC tumors from sporadic MSS CRC.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our results warrant further investigation and validation. The loci identified here may become useful biomarkers for distinguishing between FCCTX and sporadic MSS CRC tumors.",

In total, we identified 52 causative RB1 mutations in 106 patients (global mutation rate of 49%). Of the 52 patients, 48 (92%) had sporadic and familial bilateral and 4 (8%) had sporadic unilateral RB. Therefore, the detection rate of RB1 mutations was 66% (48/73) and 12% (4/33) in bilateral and unilateral cases, respectively. Mutations were classified as nonsense in 31 (60%), missense in 1 (2%), large deletion in 11 (21%), small deletion in the 7 novel (15%) and splice site mutation in 2 (4%) patients with RB. Of 31 nonsense mutations, 23 (74%) occurred in the 11 Arginine codons of the RB1. Seven mutations (13%) were novel, and 45 (87%) had been previously reported.

Proper data mining and translation of the vast datasets into clinically actionable knowledge will require the application of clinical bioinformatics. These developments have triggered multiple national initiatives in precision medicine-a data-driven approach centering on the individual. However, clinical implementation of precision medicine poses numerous challenges. Foremost, precision medicine needs to be contrasted with the powerful and widely used practice of evidence-based medicine, which is informed by meta-analyses or group-centered studies from which mean recommendations are derived. This \"one size fits all\" approach can provide inadequate solutions for outliers. Such outliers, which are far from an oddity as all of us fall into this category for some traits, can be better managed using precision medicine. Here, we argue that it is necessary and possible to bridge between precision medicine and evidence-based medicine. This will require worldwide and responsible data sharing, as well as regularly updated training programs. We also discuss the challenges and opportunities for achieving clinical utility in precision medicine. We project that, through collection, analyses and sharing of standardized medically relevant data globally, evidence-based precision medicine will shift progressively from therapy to prevention, thus leading eventually to improved, clinician-to-patient communication, citizen-centered healthcare and sustained well-being.",

Interaction or joint association between these scores has not been examined. Thus, our aim was to assess interactive and joint associations between LCRS and GRS, and each individual lifestyle risk factor, on likelihood of MI.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Data included 1534 Costa Rican adults with nonfatal acute MI and 1534 matched controls. The LCRS used estimated coefficients as weights for each factor: unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, smoking, elevated waist:hip ratio, low/high alcohol intake, low socioeconomic status. The GRS included 14 MI-associated risk alleles. Conditional logistic regressions were used to calculate adjusted odds ratios. The odds ratios for MI were 2.72 (2.33, 3.17) per LCRS unit and 1.13 (95% CI 1.06, 1.21) per GRS unit. A significant joint association for highest GRS tertile and highest LCRS tertile and odds of MI was detected (odds ratio=5.43 [3.71, 7.94]; P&lt;1.00\u00d710-7), compared to both lowest tertiles. The odds ratios were 1.74 (1.22, 2.49) under optimal lifestyle and unfavorable genetic profile, and 5.02 (3.46, 7.29) under unhealthy lifestyle but advantageous genetic profile. Significant joint associations were observed for the highest GRS tertile and the highest of each lifestyle component risk category. The interaction term was nonsignificant (P=0.33).\nCONCLUSIONS: Lifestyle risk factors and genetics are jointly associated with higher odds of MI among Hispanics/Latinos. Individual and combined lifestyle risk factors showed stronger associations. Efforts to improve lifestyle behaviors could help prevent MI regardless of genetic susceptibility.",

        "abstract": "Personalized or precision medicine as a diagnostic and therapeutic paradigm was introduced some 10-15\u00a0years ago, with the advent of biomarker discovery as a mechanism for identifying prognostic and predictive attributes associated with treatment indication and outcome. While the concept is not new, the successful development and implementation of novel 'companion diagnostics', especially in oncology, continues to represent a significant challenge and is currently at the forefront of smart trial design and therapeutic choice. The ability to determine patient selection for a specific therapy has broad implications including better chances for a positive outcome, limited exposure to potentially toxic drugs and improved health economics. Importantly, a significant step in this paradigm is the role of predictive pathology or the accurate assessment of morphology at the microscopic level. In breast cancer, this has been most useful where histologic attributes such as the classification of tubular and cribriform carcinoma dictates surgery while neoadjuvant studies suggest that patients with lobular carcinoma are not likely to benefit from chemotherapy. The next level of 'personalized pathology' at the tissue-cellular level is the use of 'protein biomarker panels' to classify the disease process and ultimately drive tumor characterization and treatment. The following review article will focus on the evolution of predictive pathology from a subjective, 'opinion-based' approach to a quantitative science. In addition, we will discuss the individual components of the precise pathology platform including advanced image analysis, biomarker quantitation with mathematical modeling and the integration with fluid-based (i.e. blood, urine) analytics as drivers of next generation precise patient phenotyping.",

Hereditary factors of which hypertension is merely a marker may explain why some hypertensive individuals appear more susceptible to cardiovascular disease, and why some ethnicities have more often seemingly hypertension-related cardiovascular disease than others. We hypothesize that, in hypertensive individuals, a positive family history of cardiovascular disease identifies a high-risk subpopulation.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Healthy Life in Urban Settings (HELIUS) is a cohort study among participants of Dutch, South-Asian Surinamese, African Surinamese, Ghanaian, Turkish, and Moroccan origin aged 70\u00a0years and younger. In participants with hypertension (n=6467), we used logistic regression to assess the association of family history of cardiovascular disease with prevalent stroke and nonstroke cardiovascular disease, adjusting for sex, age, education, and smoking. To detect ethnic differences, we tested for interaction between family history and ethnicity and stratified the analysis by ethnicity. A positive family history was associated with a higher prevalence of nonstroke cardiovascular disease (odds ratio [OR], 2.05; 95% CI, 1.65-2.54) and stroke (OR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.19-2.20). The strongest association of family history with nonstroke cardiovascular disease was found among the Dutch (OR, 2.47; 95% CI, 1.37-4.44) and with stroke among the African Surinamese (OR, 2.17; 95% CI, 1.32-3.57). The interaction between family history and African Surinamese origin for stroke was statistically significant.\nCONCLUSIONS: In multiethnic populations of hypertensive patients, a positive family history of cardiovascular disease may be used clinically to identify individuals at high risk for nonstroke cardiovascular disease regardless of ethnic origin and African Surinamese individuals at high risk for stroke.",

While some guideline characteristics that seem to explain this variation may be considered difficult to modify, the potential for variance across cancer types and treatment modalities suggests that adherence could be further improved. At the same time, these results warrant tailored strategies for the improvement of adherence to clinical practice guidelines.",

        "abstract": "About one million people per year develop colorectal cancer (CRC) and approximately half of them die. The extent of the disease (i.e. local invasion at the time of diagnosis) is a key prognostic factor. The 5-year survival rate is almost 90% in the case of delimited CRC and 10% in the case of metastasized CRC. Hence, one of the great challenges in the battle against CRC is to improve early diagnosis strategies. Large-scale proteomic approaches are widely used in cancer research to search for novel biomarkers. Such biomarkers can help in improving the accuracy of the diagnosis and in the optimization of personalized therapy. Herein, we provide an overview of studies published in the last 5 years on CRC that led to the identification of protein biomarkers suitable for clinical application by using proteomic approaches. We discussed these findings according to biomarker application, including also the role of protein phosphorylation and cancer stem cells in biomarker discovery. Our review provides a cross section of scientific approaches and can furnish suggestions for future experimental strategies to be used as reference by scientists, clinicians and researchers interested in proteomics for biomarker discovery.",

Compared to its predecessor GeneBase (1.0), GeneBase 1.1 now allows dynamic calculation and summarization in terms of median, mean, standard deviation and total for many quantitative parameters associated with genes, gene transcripts and gene features (exons, introns, coding sequences, untranslated regions). GeneBase 1.1 thus offers the opportunity to perform analyses of the main gene structure parameters also following the search for any set of genes with the desired characteristics, allowing unique functionalities not provided by the NCBI Gene itself. In order to show the potential of our tool for local parsing, structuring and dynamic summarizing of publicly available databases for data retrieval, analysis and testing of biological hypotheses, we provide as a sample application a revised set of statistics for human nuclear genes, gene transcripts and gene features. In contrast with previous estimations strongly underestimating the length of human genes, a 'mean' human protein-coding gene is 67 kbp long, has eleven 309\u2009bp long exons and ten 6355\u2009bp long introns.

Most driver alterations are missense and nonsense variants localized in the coding region of cancer genes. Unbiased cancer genome sequencing shows that synonymous SNVs (sSNVs) can be found clustered in the coding regions of several cancer oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes suggesting purifying selection. sSNVs are currently underestimated, as they are usually discarded during analysis. Furthermore, several public databases do not display sSNVs, which can lead to analytical bias and the false assumption that this mutational event is uncommon. Recent progress in our understanding of the deleterious consequences of these sSNVs for RNA stability and protein translation shows that they can act as strong drivers of cancer, as demonstrated for several cancer genes such as TP53 or BCL2L12. It is therefore essential that sSNVs be properly reported and analyzed in order to provide an accurate picture of the genetic landscape of the cancer genome.",

        "title": "Genomic Analysis of Uterine Lavage Fluid Detects Early Endometrial Cancers and Reveals a Prevalent Landscape of Driver Mutations in Women without Histopathologic Evidence of Cancer: A Prospective Cross-Sectional Study.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecologic malignancy, and its incidence and associated mortality are increasing. Despite the immediate need to detect these cancers at an earlier stage, there is no effective screening methodology or protocol for endometrial cancer. The comprehensive, genomics-based analysis of endometrial cancer by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) revealed many of the molecular defects that define this cancer. Based on these cancer genome results, and in a prospective study, we hypothesized that the use of ultra-deep, targeted gene sequencing could detect somatic mutations in uterine lavage fluid obtained from women undergoing hysteroscopy as a means of molecular screening and diagnosis.\nMETHODS AND FINDINGS: Uterine lavage and paired blood samples were collected and analyzed from 107 consecutive patients who were undergoing hysteroscopy and curettage for diagnostic evaluation from this single-institution study. The lavage fluid was separated into cellular and acellular fractions by centrifugation. Cellular and cell-free DNA (cfDNA) were isolated from each lavage. Two targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) gene panels, one composed of 56 genes and the other of 12 genes, were used for ultra-deep sequencing. To rule out potential NGS-based errors, orthogonal mutation validation was performed using digital PCR and Sanger sequencing. Seven patients were diagnosed with endometrial cancer based on classic histopathologic analysis. Six of these patients had stage IA cancer, and one of these cancers was only detectable as a microscopic focus within a polyp. All seven patients were found to have significant cancer-associated gene mutations in both cell pellet and cfDNA fractions. In the four patients in whom adequate tumor sample was available, all tumor mutations above a specific allele fraction were present in the uterine lavage DNA samples. Mutations originally only detected in lavage fluid fractions were later confirmed to be present in tumor but at allele fractions significantly less than 1%. Of the remaining 95 patients diagnosed with benign or non-cancer pathology, 44 had no significant cancer mutations detected. Intriguingly, 51 patients without histopathologic evidence of cancer had relatively high allele fraction (1.0%-30.4%), cancer-associated mutations. Participants with detected driver and potential driver mutations were significantly older (mean age mutated = 57.96, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.30-\u221e, mean age no mutations = 50.35; p-value = 0.002; Benjamini-Hochberg [BH] adjusted p-value = 0.015) and more likely to be post-menopausal (p-value = 0.004; BH-adjusted p-value = 0.015) than those without these mutations. No associations were detected between mutation status and race/ethnicity, body mass index, diabetes, parity, and smoking status. Long-term follow-up was not presently available in this prospective study for those women without histopathologic evidence of cancer.\nCONCLUSIONS: Using ultra-deep NGS, we identified somatic mutations in DNA extracted both from cell pellets and a never previously reported cfDNA fraction from the uterine lavage. Using our targeted sequencing approach, endometrial driver mutations were identified in all seven women who received a cancer diagnosis based on classic histopathology of tissue curettage obtained at the time of hysteroscopy. In addition, relatively high allele fraction driver mutations were identified in the lavage fluid of approximately half of the women without a cancer diagnosis. Increasing age and post-menopausal status were associated with the presence of these cancer-associated mutations, suggesting the prevalent existence of a premalignant landscape in women without clinical evidence of cancer. Given that a uterine lavage can be easily and quickly performed even outside of the operating room and in a physician's office-based setting, our findings suggest the future possibility of this approach for screening women for the earliest stages of endometrial cancer. However, our findings suggest that further insight into development of cancer or its interruption are needed before translation to the clinic.",

However, there is remarkably little consensus on the value of telomere length in the prognostic evaluation of esophageal cancers. Here, we attempted to determine the association of variable telomere length with clinical outcome of esophageal cancer patients.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Using real-time quantitative PCR, we examined relative telomere lengths (RTL) in a cohort of esophageal cancer and normal esophageal tissues, and statistically investigated the association between RTL and clinical outcomes of esophageal cancer patients.\nRESULTS: The majority of esophageal cancers in this study had longer RTLs as compared to adjacent non-tumor tissues. Enhanced tumor RTL was associated with smoking habit, poor differentiation, advanced tumor stage, lymph node metastasis and cancer related death. In particular, a close relationship between longer RTL and poor survival was fully demonstrated by using cox regression and Kaplan-Maier survival curves.\nCONCLUSIONS: We found frequent telomere elongation in esophageal cancer tissues, and demonstrated longer RTL may be an independent poor prognostic factor for esophageal cancer patients.",

        "abstract": "Although tuberculosis is largely a curable disease, it remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Although the standard 6-month treatment regimen is highly effective for drug-susceptible tuberculosis, the use of multiple drugs over long periods of time can cause frequent adverse drug reactions. In addition, some patients with drug-susceptible tuberculosis do not respond adequately to treatment and develop treatment failure and drug resistance. Response to tuberculosis treatment could be affected by multiple factors associated with the host-pathogen interaction including genetic factors and the nutritional status of the host. These factors should be considered for effective tuberculosis control. Therefore, therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), which is individualized drug dosing guided by serum drug concentrations during treatment, and pharmacogenetics-based personalized dosing guidelines of anti-tuberculosis drugs could reduce the incidence of adverse drug reactions and increase the likelihood of successful treatment outcomes. Moreover, assessment and management of comorbid conditions including nutritional status could improve anti-tuberculosis treatment response.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Women with highly penetrant BRCA mutations have a 55-60% lifetime risk for breast cancer and a 16-59% lifetime risk for ovarian cancer. However, penetrance differs interindividually, indicating that environmental and behavioral factors may modify this risk. These include lifestyle factors such as physical activity status, dietary habits, and body weight. The modification of penetrance by changing lifestyle factors has not thus far been investigated in a randomized trial in BRCA mutation carriers.\nMETHODS: Therefore, we intend to enroll 60 BRCA1/2 mutation carriers in a pilot feasibility study (Lifestyle Intervention Study in Women with Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer (LIBRE) pilot). This multi-center, prospective, controlled trial aims to randomize (1:1) participants into a (1) multi-factorial lifestyle intervention group (IG) versus (2) the control group with usual care (CG). The primary endpoint is feasibility and acceptance of a structured interdisciplinary lifestyle intervention program over 12\u00a0months (at least 70% of the patients to complete the 1-year intervention). Furthermore, the effects on physical fitness, BMI, quality of life, and stress coping capacity will be investigated. During the first 3\u00a0months, women in the IG will receive structured, individualized and mainly supervised endurance training of \u226518 MET*h/week (MET\u2009=\u2009metabolic equivalent task) and personal nutritional counseling based on the Mediterranean diet. During the subsequent 9\u00a0months, the IG will receive monthly group training sessions and regular telephone contacts for motivation, whereas the CG will only receive usual care (one general counseling on healthy nutrition and benefits of regular physical activity on health status). At randomization and subsequent time points (3, 6, 12\u00a0months), cardiopulmonary fitness will be assessed by spiroergometry and nutritional and psychological status by validated questionnaires.\nDISCUSSION: This pilot study will investigate the optimal strategy to improve physical fitness, nutritional habits, and psychological factors in women at high risk for developing breast or ovarian cancer. The results of this pilot feasibility study will be the basis for a larger prospective randomized trial including clinical events (LIBRE).\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02087592.",

        "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Advances in the evaluation and treatment of breast cancer have made the clinical decision-making context much more complex. A second opinion from a medical oncologist may facilitate decision making for women with breast cancer, yet little is known about second opinion use.\nOBJECTIVE: To investigate the patterns and correlates of second opinion use and the effect on chemotherapy decisions.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1901 women newly diagnosed with stages 0 to II breast cancer between July 2013 and September 2014 (response rate, 71.0%) were accrued through 2 population-based Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registries (Georgia and Los Angeles County, California) and surveyed about their experiences with medical oncologists, decision making, and chemotherapy use.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Factors associated with second opinion use were evaluated using logistic regression. Also assessed was the association between second opinion and chemotherapy use, adjusting for chemotherapy indication and propensity for receiving a second opinion. Multiple imputation and weighting were used to account for missing data.\nRESULTS: A total of 1901 patients with stage I to II breast cancer (mean [SD] age, 61.6 [11.0] years; 1071 [56.3%] non-Hispanic white) saw any medical oncologist. Analysis of multiply imputed, weighted data (mean n\u2009=\u20091866) showed that 168 (9.8%) (SE, 0.74%) received a second opinion and 54 (3.2%) (SE, 0.47%) received chemotherapy from the second oncologist. Satisfaction with chemotherapy decisions was high and did not differ between those who did (mean [SD], 4.3 [0.08] on a 1- to 5-point scale) or did not (4.4 [0.03]) obtain a second opinion (P\u2009=\u2009.29). Predictors of second opinion use included college education vs less education (odds ratio [OR], 1.85; 95% CI, 1.24-2.75), frequent use of internet-based support groups (OR, 2.15; 95% CI, 1.12-4.11), an intermediate result on the 21-gene recurrence score assay (OR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.11-3.09), and a variant of uncertain significance on hereditary cancer genetic testing (OR, 3.24; 95% CI, 1.09-9.59). After controlling for patient and tumor characteristics, second opinion use was not associated with chemotherapy receipt (OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.71-1.52).\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Second opinion use was low (<10%) among patients with early-stage breast cancer, and high decision satisfaction regardless of second opinion use suggests little unmet demand. Along with educational level and use of internet support groups, uncertain results on genomic testing predicted second opinion use. Patient demand for second opinions may increase as more complex genomic tests are disseminated.",

Since CRC is largely asymptomatic until alarm features develop to advanced stages, the implementation of the screening programme is very much essential to reduce cancer incidence and mortality rates. CRC occurs predominantly from accumulation of genetic and epigenetic changes in colon epithelial cells, which later gets transformed into adenocarcinomas.\nSCOPE OF REVIEW: The current challenges of screening paradigm and diagnostic ranges are from semi-invasive methods like colonoscopy to non-invasive stool-based test, have resulted in over-diagnosis and over-treatment of CRC. Hence, new screening initiatives and deep studies are required for early diagnosis of CRC. In this regard, we not only summarise current predictive and prognostic biomarkers with their potential for diagnostic and therapeutic applications, but also describe current limitations, future perspectives and challenges associated with the progression of CRC.\nMAJOR CONCLUSIONS: Currently many potential biomarkers have already been successfully translated into clinical practice eg. Fecal haemoglobin, Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and CA19.9, although these are not highly promising diagnostic target for personalized medicine. So there is a critical need for reliable, minimally invasive, highly sensitive and specific genetic markers of an individualised and optimised patient treatment at the earliest disease stage possible.\nGENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Identification of a new biomarker, or a set of biomarkers to the development of a valid, and clinical sensible assay that can be served as an alternative tool for early diagnosis of CRC and open up promising new targets in therapeutic intervention strategies.",

        "abstract": "It is common that cancer patients have different molecular signatures even though they have similar clinical features, such as histology, due to the heterogeneity of tumors. To overcome this variability, we previously developed a new approach incorporating prior biological knowledge that identifies knowledge-driven genomic interactions associated with outcomes of interest. However, no systematic approach has been proposed to identify interaction models between pathways based on multi-omics data. Here we have proposed such a novel methodological framework, called metadimensional knowledge-driven genomic interactions (MKGIs). To test the utility of the proposed framework, we applied it to an ovarian cancer dataset including multi-omics profiles from The Cancer Genome Atlas to predict grade, stage, and survival outcome. We found that each knowledge-driven genomic interaction model, based on different genomic datasets, contains different sets of pathway features, which suggests that each genomic data type may contribute to outcomes in ovarian cancer via a different pathway. In addition, MKGI models significantly outperformed the single knowledge-driven genomic interaction model. From the MKGI models, many interactions between pathways associated with outcomes were found, including the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway and the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) signaling pathway, which are known to play important roles in cancer pathogenesis. The beauty of incorporating biological knowledge into the model based on multi-omics data is the ability to improve diagnosis and prognosis and provide better interpretability. Thus, determining variability in molecular signatures based on these interactions between pathways may lead to better diagnostic/treatment strategies for better precision medicine.",

The adoption of pharmacogenetic (PGx) testing in patient care requires accurate, cost effective and rapid genotyping with clear guidance on the use of the results. Hence, we evaluated a 32 SNPs panel for implementing PGx testing in clinical laboratories.\nMETHODS: We designed a 32-SNP panel for PGx testing in clinical laboratories. The variants were selected using the clinical annotations of the Pharmacogenomics Knowledgebase (PharmGKB) and include polymorphisms of CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A5 and VKORC1 genes. The CYP2D6 gene allele quantification was determined simultaneously with TaqMan copy number assays targeting intron 2 and exon 9 regions. The genotyping results showed high call rate accuracy according to concordance with genotypes identified by independent analyses on Sequenome massarray and droplet digital PCR. Furthermore, 506 genomic samples across three major ethnic groups of Singapore (Malay, Indian and Chinese) were analysed on our workflow.\nRESULTS: We found that 98% of our study subjects carry one or more CPIC actionable variants. The major alleles detected include CYP2C9*3, CYP2C19*2, CYP2D6*10, CYP2D6*36, CYP2D6*41, CYP3A5*3 and VKORC1*2. These translate into a high percentage of intermediate (IM) and poor metabolizer (PM) phenotypes for these genes in our population.\nCONCLUSION: Genotyping may be useful to identify patients who are prone to drug toxicity with standard doses of drug therapy in our population.

Currently, the only characteristic used to predict poor response to clinical treatment in this syndrome is the presence of hippocampal sclerosis. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located in genes encoding drug transporter and metabolism proteins could influence response to therapy. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate whether combining information from clinical variables as well as SNPs in candidate genes could improve the accuracy of predicting response to drug therapy in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. For this, we divided 237 patients into two groups: 75 responsive and 162 refractory to antiepileptic drug therapy. We genotyped 119 SNPs in ABCB1, ABCC2, CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP1B1, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP3A4, and CYP3A5 genes. We used 98 additional SNPs to evaluate population stratification. We assessed a first scenario using only clinical variables and a second one including SNP information. The random forests algorithm combined with leave-one-out cross-validation was used to identify the best predictive model in each scenario and compared their accuracies using the area under the curve statistic. Additionally, we built a variable importance plot to present the set of most relevant predictors on the best model. The selected best model included the presence of hippocampal sclerosis and 56 SNPs. Furthermore, including SNPs in the model improved accuracy from 0.4568 to 0.8177. Our findings suggest that adding genetic information provided by SNPs, located on drug transport and metabolism genes, can improve the accuracy for predicting which patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy are likely to be refractory to drug treatment, making it possible to identify patients who may benefit from epilepsy surgery sooner.",

        "abstract": "The rise of bioinformatics is a direct response to the political difficulties faced by genomics in its quest to be a new biomedical innovation, and the value of bioinformatics lies in its role as the bridge between the promise of genomics and its realization in the form of health benefits. Western scientific elites are able to use their close relationship with the state to control and facilitate the emergence of new domains compatible with the existing distribution of epistemic power - all within the embrace of public trust. The incorporation of bioinformatics as the saviour of genomics had to be integrated with the operation of two key aspects of governance in this field: the definition and ownership of the new knowledge. This was achieved mainly by the development of common standards and by the promotion of the values of communality, open access and the public ownership of data to legitimize and maintain the governance power of publicly funded genomic science. Opposition from industry advocating the private ownership of knowledge has been largely neutered through the institutions supporting the science-state concordat. However, in order for translation into health benefits to occur and public trust to be assured, genomic and clinical data have to be integrated and knowledge ownership agreed upon across the separate and distinct governance territories of scientist, clinical medicine and society. Tensions abound as science seeks ways of maintaining its control of knowledge production through the negotiation of new forms of governance with the institutions and values of clinicians and patients.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Recognizing patterns of coronary heart disease (CHD) risk in families helps to identify and target individuals who may have the most to gain from preventive interventions. The overall goal of the study is to test the effectiveness and sustainability of an integrated care model for managing cardiovascular risk in high risk families. The proposed care model targets the structural and environmental conditions that predispose high risk families to development of CHD through the following interventions: 1) screening for cardiovascular risk factors, 2) providing lifestyle interventions 3) providing a framework for linkage to appropriate primary health care facility, and 4) active follow-up of intervention adherence.\nMETHODS: Initially, a formative qualitative research component will gather information on understanding of diseases, barriers to care, specific components of the intervention package and feedback on the intervention. Then a cluster randomized controlled trial involving 740 families comprising 1480 participants will be conducted to determine whether the package of interventions (integrated care model) is effective in reducing or preventing the progression of CHD risk factors and risk factor clustering in families. The sustainability and scalability of this intervention will be assessed through economic (cost-effectiveness analyses) and qualitative evaluation (process outcomes) to estimate value and acceptability. Scalability is informed by cost-effectiveness and acceptability of the integrated cardiovascular risk reduction approach.\nDISCUSSION: Knowledge generated from this trial has the potential to significantly affect new programmatic policy and clinical guidelines that will lead to improvements in cardiovascular health in India.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT02771873, registered in May 2016 ( https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/results/NCT02771873 ).",

We evaluated therapeutic response outcomes in patients with type I EOC treated with genotype-matched therapy on clinical trials enrolled in a prospective molecular profiling program.\nMATERIAL AND METHODS: Formalin fixed paraffin embedded tumor tissues were prospectively screened for genomic alterations using MALDI-ToF mass-spectrometry platform or targeted sequencing using the Illumina MiSeq TruSeq Amplicon Cancer Panel. Treatment outcomes on genotype-matched trials were retrospectively reviewed using RECIST version 1.1 and Gynecological Cancer Intergroup CA125 related-response criteria RESULTS: 55 patients with type I EOC underwent molecular profiling, 41 (75%) low grade serous (LGS), 9 (16%) clear cell (CC), and 5 (9%) mucinous (MC) histologies. Thirty-five patients (64%) were found to have \u22651 somatic mutations: 23 KRAS, 6 NRAS, 5 PIK3CA, 2 PTEN, 1 BRAF, 1 AKT, 1 TP53, and 1 CTNNB1. Fifteen patients were subsequently enrolled in genotype-matched phase I or II trials, including 14 patients with KRAS/NRAS mutations treated with MEK inhibitor targeted combinations. Among 14 RECIST evaluable patients, there were 7 partial responses (PR), 7 stable disease (SD) and 1 disease progression (PD).

The sequencing results were compared with multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC) data in 66 specimens (25 patients) analyzed by both methods. There was a strong concordance (82%) between the methods in the qualitative determination of the presence of disease. However, in 17% of cases, leukemia was detected by sequencing but not by MFC. In 54 bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) paired specimens, the burden of leukemia detected by NGS was lower in PB than in BM, although it was still detectable in 68% of the 28 paired specimens with positive BM.

Statins are one of the classes of drugs that could benefit from this approach because of their wide use and their incidence of adverse events.\nMETHODS: Literature from PubMed databases and bibliography from retrieved publications have been analyzed according to terms such as statins, pharmacogenetics, epigenetics, toxicity and drug-drug interaction, among others. The search was performed until 1 October 2016 for articles published in English language.\nRESULTS: Several technical and methodological approaches have been adopted, including candidate gene and next generation sequencing (NGS) analyses, the latter being more robust and reliable. Among genes identified as possible predictive factors associated with statins toxicity, cytochrome P450 isoforms, transmembrane transporters and mitochondrial enzymes are the best characterized. Finally, the solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 1B1 (SLCO1B1) transporter seems to be the best target for future studies. Moreover, drug-drug interactions need to be considered for the best approach to personalized treatment.\nCONCLUSIONS: Pharmacogenetics of statins includes several possible genes and their polymorphisms, but muscular toxicities seem better related to SLCO1B1 variant alleles. Their analysis in the general population of patients taking statins could improve treatment adherence and efficacy; however, the cost-efficacy ratio should be carefully evaluated.",

Despite widespread use, minimal research has evaluated the content of HHQs used in general internal medicine and family medicine (GIM/FM), integrative medicine, and complementary and alternative medicine (CAM; chiropractic, naturopathic, and Traditional Chinese Medicine [TCM]) clinics. Integrative medicine and CAM claim greater emphasis on well-being than does GIM/FM. This study investigated whether integrative medicine and CAM clinics' HHQs include more well-being content and otherwise differ from GIM/FM HHQs.\nMETHODS: HHQs were obtained from GIM/FM (n\u2009=\u20099), integrative medicine (n\u2009=\u200911), naturopathic medicine (n\u2009=\u20095), chiropractic (n\u2009=\u20094), and TCM (n\u2009=\u20097) clinics in California. HHQs were coded for presence of medical history (chief complaint, past medical history, social history, family history, surgeries, hospitalizations, medications, allergies, review of systems), health maintenance procedures (immunization, screenings), and well-being components (nutrition, exercise, stress, sleep, spirituality).\nRESULTS: In HHQs of GIM/FM clinics, the average number of well-being components was 1.4 (standard deviation [SD], 1.4) compared with 4.0 (SD, 1.1) for integrative medicine (p\u2009<\u20090.01), 3.2 (SD, 2.1) for naturopathic medicine (p\u2009=\u20090.04), 2.0 (SD, 1.4) for chiropractic (p\u2009=\u20090.54), and 2.0 (SD, 1.5) for TCM (p\u2009=\u20090.47). In HHQs of GIM/FM clinics, the average number of medical history components was 6.4 (SD, 1.9) compared with 8.3 (SD, 1.2) for integrative medicine (p\u2009=\u20090.01), 9.0 (SD, 0) for naturopathic medicine (p\u2009=\u20090.01), 7.1 (SD, 2.8) for chiropractic (p\u2009=\u20090.58), and 7.1 (SD, 1.7) for TCM (p\u2009=\u20090.41).\nCONCLUSIONS: Integrative and naturopathic medicine HHQs included significantly more well-being and medical history components than did GIM/FM HHQs. Further investigation is warranted to determine the optimal HHQ content to support the clinical and preventive health goals of general internal medicine, family medicine, integrative medicine, and CAM practices.",

        "abstract": "Genetic variability in drug-metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters is known to influence the pharmacokinetics of many drugs. Antimalarial drugs are a class of agents known to utilize metabolic and elimination pathways prone to genetic variation. This paper aims to review the genetic variants affecting antimalarial medications and discuss their clinical implications. Data were identified for the genes coding for the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes: CYP2C8, CYP2C19, CYP2A6, CYP2D6, CYP2B6, and the P-glycoprotein drug transporter. Adverse effects of amodiaquine were more common in patients with decreased CYP2C8 metabolism. CYP2C19 variants influenced the metabolism of proguanil but no differences in efficacy outcomes were observed. Ultra-metabolizers of CYP2A6 showed increased incidence of adverse effects of artesunate (prodrug for active metabolite, dihydroartemisinin). In the presence of efavirenz, mutations in CYP2B6 influenced the number of patients achieving day-7 lumefantrine concentrations above accepted therapeutic cut-offs. Lumefantrine concentrations were also influenced by ABCB1 variants in the presence of nevirapine. The most critical pharmacogenetic consideration identified was the association of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency with development of hemolytic anemia and decreased hemoglobin levels in patients treated with primaquine or a combination of chlorproguanil-dapsone-artesunate. These findings demonstrate a need for close monitoring of patients originating from populations where genetic variation in metabolizing enzymes is prevalent, so as to ensure that optimal clinical outcomes are achieved. Future studies should determine which populations are at greatest risk of potential treatment failures and/or adverse effects, which drugs are most susceptible to genetic variation in metabolizing enzymes, and the impact of genetic influence on the efficacy and safety of first-line treatment regimens.",

Data were collected from fetal anatomic surveys, fetal echocardiograms, noninvasive trisomy 21 screening programs, invasive genetic studies, and neonatal records.\nRESULTS: Seventy-nine fetuses with ARSA were identified at 20.3\u2009\u00b1\u20093.8 weeks' gestation. Forty-eight fetuses underwent chromosomal evaluation. Of those, seven had trisomy 21. Four other fetuses had unusual karyotype abnormalities. All fetuses with genetic anomalies had additional aberrant ultrasound findings. There were three spontaneous fetal deaths (trisomy 21-2 and Wolf-Hirshhorn-1). Nine pregnancies were terminated because of abnormalities and one died as a result of hypoplastic left heart syndrome. No neonate was found or suspected to have 22q11.2 deletion. The ARSA was isolated in 43 fetuses; all had unremarkable neonatal outcomes, and none were readmitted within 6 months after discharge.\nCONCLUSIONS: As an apparently isolated finding, ARSA is benign and not associated with trisomy 21 or 22q11.2 deletion. The finding of ARSA, however, warrants a detailed fetal ultrasound. All fetuses with ARSA and genetic anomalies had additional ultrasound findings.",

Pharmacological treatments play an important role in the multimodal treatment of ADHD. Currently, there is a lack of up-to-date and comprehensive evidence on how available ADHD drugs compare and rank in terms of efficacy and tolerability, in children or adolescents as well as in adults. We will conduct a network meta-analysis (NMA), integrating direct and indirect comparisons from randomised controlled trials (RCTs), to rank pharmacological treatments for ADHD according to their efficacy and tolerability profiles.\nMETHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will search a broad range of electronic databases, including PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, ERIC and Web of Science, with no date or language restrictions. We will also search for unpublished studies using international clinical trial registries and contacting relevant drug companies. We will identify and include available parallel-group, cross-over and cluster randomised trials that compare methylphenidate, dexmethylphenidate, amphetamine derivatives (including lisdexamfetamine), atomoxetine, clonidine, guanfacine, bupropion or modafinil (as oral therapy) either with each other or to placebo, in children, adolescents or adults with ADHD. Primary outcomes will be efficacy (indicated by reduction in severity of ADHD core symptoms measured on a standardised scale) and tolerability (the proportion of patients who left a study early due to side effects). Secondary outcomes will be global functioning, acceptability (proportion of patients who left the study early by any cause) and changes in blood pressure and body weight. NMA will be conducted in STATA within a frequentist framework. The quality of RCTs will be evaluated using the Cochrane risk of bias tool, and the quality of the evidence will be assessed using the GRADE approach. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses will be conducted to assess the robustness of the findings.\nETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: No ethical issues are foreseen.

We report on an 18-month-old patient with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency that was originally diagnosed with classical galactosemia. The patient presented with elevated liver function enzymes and bilirubinemia and was immediately treated with soy-based formula. Confirmatory tests revealed deficiency of the GALT enzyme, however, full-sequencing of GALT was normal, suggestive of a different ideology. The Beutler spot assay uses three other enzymatic steps in addition to GALT. A deficiency in either of these enzymes can result in suspected decreased GALT activity when using the Beutler assay. Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation screening for phosphoglucomutase-1 deficiency was negative. Quantitative analysis of G6PD enzyme in red blood cells showed a severe deficiency and a deletion in G6PD. Soy-formula, the standard treatment for galactosemia, has been reported to trigger hemolysis in G6PD deficient patients.

One of the most difficult challenges faced by clinicians is identifying patients who may benefit most from adjuvant chemotherapy, and distinguishing these cases from those where endocrine therapy may be sufficient for cure. Genomic tests such as the Oncotype DX\u00ae Breast Recurrence Score\u00ae Assay have been developed to provide a robust and clinically validated assessment of a patient's individual tumour signature. The Oncotype DX Assay is included in treatment guidelines for estimating both the risk of distant recurrence and predicting adjuvant chemotherapy benefit for early-stage breast cancer patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative, oestrogen-receptor positive, and axillary lymph node negative or positive (1-3 positive nodes) disease. In this article, we review unmet needs for prognostication and prediction in early-stage breast cancer, and consider how the information provided by the Recurrence Score is complementary to that gained from the assessment of more traditional clinicopathologic criteria.

This is one of the ultimate goals of genetic analysis, which motivated most CAGI participants to look for powerful new methods. In the 2016 CD challenge, we implemented all the best methods proposed in the past editions. This resulted in 10 algorithms, which were evaluated fairly by CAGI organizers. We also used all the data available from CAGI 11 and 13 to maximize the amount of training samples. The most effective algorithms used known genes associated with CD from the literature. No method could evaluate effectively the importance of unannotated variants by using heuristics. As a downside, all CD datasets were strongly affected by sample stratification. This affected the performance reported by assessors. Therefore, we expect that future datasets will be normalized in order to remove population effects.

The purpose of the current investigation was to define the current spectrum of mutations causing FH in Israel.\nMETHODS: New families were collected through the MEDPED (Make Early Diagnosis Prevent Early Death) FH program. Molecular analysis of the LDLR, PCSK9 and APOB genes was done using High Resolution Melt and direct sequencing in 67 index cases. A 6-SNP LDL-C gene score calculation for polygenic hypercholesterolaemia was done using TaqMan genotyping.\nRESULTS: Mean serum cholesterol was 7.48\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.89\u00a0mmol/L and the mean serum LDL-C was 5.99\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.89\u00a0mmol/L. Mutations in the LDLR and APOB gene were found in 24 cases (35.8%), with 16 in LDLR, none in PCSK9 and one, p.(R3527Q), in the APOB gene, which is the first APOB mutation carrier identified in the Israeli population. Of the LDLR mutations, two were novel; p.(E140A) and a promoter variant, c.-191C\u00a0>\u00a0A. The c.2479G\u00a0>\u00a0A p.(V827I) in exon 17 of the LDLR gene was found in 8 patients (33.3% of the mutations) with modestly elevated LDL-C, but also in a compound heterozygous patient with a clinical homozygous FH phenotype, consistent with this being a \"mild\" FH-causing variant. A significantly higher 6-SNP LDL-C score was found in mutation-negative cases compared with a normal Caucasian cohort (p\u00a0= 0.03), confirming that polygenic inheritance of common LDL-C raising SNPs can produce an FH phenocopy.\nCONCLUSIONS: The results indicate a different spectrum of genetic causes of FH from that found previously, in concordance with the heterogeneous and changing origins of the Israeli population, and confirm that a polygenic cause is also contributing to the FH phenotype in Israel.",

Surgery aiming for complete tumor resection (R0) remains the cornerstone of the treatment for HBP cancers. The current progress in the adjuvant treatment is quite slow, with gemcitabine chemotherapy available only for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA). In the advanced and metastatic setting, only two targeted drugs have been approved by the Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA), which are sorafenib for hepatocellular carcinoma and erlotinib for PDA. It is a pity that multiple Phase III randomized control trials testing the efficacy of targeted agents have negative results. Failure in the development of effective drugs probably reflects the poor understanding of genome-wide alterations and molecular mechanisms orchestrating therapeutic resistance and recurrence. In the post-ENCODE (Encyclopedia of DNA Elements) era, cancer is referred to as a highly heterogeneous and systemic disease of the genome. The unprecedented potential of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies to accurately identify genetic and genomic variations has attracted major research and clinical interest. The applications of NGS include targeted NGS with potential clinical implications, while whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing focus on the discovery of both novel cancer driver genes and therapeutic targets. These advances dictate new designs for clinical trials to validate biomarkers and drugs.

The relative contribution of genetic factors has been estimated to be up to 80%. The mode of inheritance is complex, non-Mendelian, and in most cases involving the combined action of large numbers of genes.\nMETHODS: This review summarises recent efforts to identify genetic variants associated with schizophrenia detected, e.g., through genome-wide association studies, studies on copy-number variants or next-generation sequencing.\nRESULTS: A large, new body of evidence on genetics of schizophrenia has accumulated over recent years. Many new robustly associated genetic loci have been detected. Furthermore, there is consensus that at least a dozen microdeletions and microduplications contribute to the disease. Genetic overlap between schizophrenia, other psychiatric disorders, and neurodevelopmental syndromes raised new questions regarding the current classification of psychiatric and neurodevelopmental diseases.\nCONCLUSIONS: Future studies will address especially the functional characterisation of genetic variants.

The study dates were August 2012 to July 2015.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Participants in the top and bottom 10% of the risk distribution underwent standard and quantitative neurological examination, including disability status, visual, cognitive, motor, and sensory testing, as well as qualitative and quantitative neuroimaging with 3-T brain MRI and optical coherence tomography.\nRESULTS: This study included 100 participants at risk for MS, with 41 at higher risk (40 women [98%]) and 59 at lower risk (25 women [42%]), at a mean (SD) age of 35.1 (8.7) years. Given the unequal sex distribution between the 2 groups, the analyses were restricted to women (n\u2009=\u200965). When considering all measured outcomes, higher-risk women differed from lower-risk women (P\u2009=\u2009.01 by omnibus test). Detailed testing with a vibration sensitivity testing device in a subgroup of 47 women showed that higher-risk women exhibited significantly poorer vibration perception in the distal lower extremities (P\u2009=\u2009.008, adjusting for age, height, and testing date). Furthermore, 5 of 65 women (8%) (4 at higher risk and 1 at lower risk) met the primary neuroimaging outcome of having T2-weighted hyperintense brain lesions consistent with the 2010 McDonald MRI criteria for dissemination in space. A subset of participants harbor many different neuroimaging features associated with MS, including perivenous T2-weighted hyperintense lesions and focal leptomeningeal enhancement, consistent with the hypothesis that these individuals are at higher risk of developing clinical symptoms of MS than the general population.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Higher-risk asymptomatic family members of patients with MS are more likely to have early subclinical manifestations of MS. These findings underscore the importance of early detection in high-risk individuals.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01353547.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a genetic condition characterized by low serum levels of the protein alpha-1 antitrypsin. Because there are no unique clinical symptoms that point to a definitive diagnosis of AATD, laboratory testing is crucial to differentiate this disease from others.\nOBJECTIVE: To summarize advances in laboratory techniques used to test for AATD.\nMETHODS: Data were sourced from a nonsystematic literature review of MEDLINE and the author's personal literature collection, and by checking reference lists of sourced articles.\nRESULTS: Since the original description of AATD by Laurell and Eriksson in 1963, testing methods have undergone major changes. Currently, alpha-1 antitrypsin protein is quantified by immunologic measurement in serum, and the phenotype is characterized by isoelectric focusing and/or targeted genotyping of predefined mutations. In addition, whole-gene sequencing of the gene SERPINA1 can be undertaken. However, this is costly and generally used only if targeted genotyping cannot conclusively identify the variant. The introduction of next-generation sequencing (NGS), which enables rapid and accurate sequencing of large quantities of DNA fragments in a single reaction, may help reduce costs. With its increasing availability, NGS may begin to appear in testing protocols. Clinical guidelines recommend that patients are tested for AATD if they have chronic irreversible airflow obstruction, especially those with early onset disease or a positive family history of AATD. Despite this, AATD is still underrecognized, and significant delays exist between symptom onset and diagnosis.\nCONCLUSION: Traditional testing practices have limitations. Screening programs that incorporate NGS are the most comprehensive methods available for accurate diagnosis of AATD.",

        "title": "Improving Oncology Quality Measurement in Accountable Care: Filling Gaps with Cross-Cutting Measures.",
        "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Payment for health care services, including oncology services, is shifting from volume-based fee-for-service to value-based accountable care. The objective of accountable care is to support providers with flexibility and resources to reform care delivery, accompanied by accountability for maintaining or improving outcomes while lowering costs. These changes depend on health care payers, systems, physicians, and patients having meaningful measures to assess care delivery and outcomes and to balance financial incentives for lowering costs while providing greater value. Gaps in accountable care measure sets may cause missed signals of problems in care and missed opportunities for improvement. Measures to balance financial incentives may be particularly important for oncology, where high cost and increasingly targeted diagnostics and therapeutics intersect with the highly complex and heterogeneous needs and preferences of cancer patients. Moreover, the concept of value in cancer care, defined as the measure of outcomes achieved per costs incurred, is rarely incorporated into performance measurement. This article analyzes gaps in oncology measures in accountable care, discusses challenging measurement issues, and offers strategies for improving oncology measurement. Discern Health analyzed gaps in accountable care measure sets for 10 cancer conditions that were selected based on incidence and prevalence; impact on cost and mortality; a diverse range of high-cost diagnostic procedures and treatment modalities (e.g., genomic tumor testing, molecularly targeted therapies, and stereotactic radiotherapy); and disparities or performance gaps in patient care. We identified gaps by comparing accountable care set measures with high-priority measurement opportunities derived from practice guidelines developed by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network and other oncology specialty societies. We found significant gaps in accountable care measure sets across all 10 conditions. For each gap, we searched for available measures not already being used in programs. Where existing measures did not cover gaps, we recommended refinements to existing measures or proposed measures for development. We shared the results of the measure gap analysis with a roundtable of national experts in cancer care and oncology measurement. During a web meeting and an in-person meeting, the roundtable reviewed the gap analysis and identified priority opportunities for improving measurement. The group determined that overreliance on condition-specific process measures is problematic because of rapidly changing evidence and increasing personalization of cancer care. The group's primary recommendation for enhancing measure sets was to prioritize and develop effective cross-cutting measures that assess clinical and patient-reported outcomes, including shared decision making, care planning, and symptom control. The group also prioritized certain safety and structural measures to complement condition-specific process measures. Further, the group explored strategies for using clinical pathways and devising layered measurement approaches to improve measurement for accountable care. This article presents the roundtable's conclusions and recommendations for next steps.\nDISCLOSURES: Funding for this project was provided by the National Pharmaceutical Council (NPC).

        "abstract": "Ongoing controversy over the optimal approach to breast cancer screening has led to discordant professional society recommendations, particularly in women age 40 to 49 years. One potential solution is risk-based screening, where decisions around the starting age, stopping age, frequency, and modality of screening are based on individual risk to maximize the early detection of aggressive cancers and minimize the harms of screening through optimal resource utilization. We present a novel approach to risk-based screening that integrates clinical risk factors, breast density, a polygenic risk score representing the cumulative effects of genetic variants, and sequencing for moderate- and high-penetrance germline mutations. We demonstrate how thresholds of absolute risk estimates generated by our prediction tools can be used to stratify women into different screening strategies (biennial mammography, annual mammography, annual mammography with adjunctive magnetic resonance imaging, defer screening at this time) while informing the starting age of screening for women age 40 to 49 years. Our risk thresholds and corresponding screening strategies are based on current evidence but need to be tested in clinical trials. The Women Informed to Screen Depending On Measures of risk (WISDOM) Study, a pragmatic, preference-tolerant randomized controlled trial of annual vs personalized screening, will study our proposed approach. WISDOM will evaluate the efficacy, safety, and acceptability of risk-based screening beginning in the fall of 2016. The adaptive design of this trial allows continued refinement of our risk thresholds as the trial progresses, and we discuss areas where we anticipate emerging evidence will impact our approach.",

To evaluate BRAF V600E mutations, a conventional polymerase chain reaction(PCR)is performed but recently immunohistochemistry (IHC)with a BRAF antibody has been used. Although similarities between the PCR and IHC methods have been reported, some investigators have doubts about the usefulness of IHC for BRAF mutation analysis. The subjects were 38 colorectal cancer patients with tumors demonstrating loss of both MLH1 and PMS2, and high-level microsatellite instability. Of the original 39 patients, 1 was excluded due to Lynch syndrome, which was identified using germline mutation testing. The mutation rate of BRAF V600E was 57.9% using both methods, but the concordance rate was 68.4%, with a kappa-value of 0.33.

        "abstract": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Noninvasive prenatal diagnosis for single gene disorders is coming to fruition in its clinical utility. The presence of cell-free DNA in maternal plasma has been recognized for many years, and a number of applications have developed from this. Noninvasive prenatal diagnosis for single gene disorders has lagged behind due to complexities of technology development, lack of investment and the need for validation samples for rare disorders.\nRECENT FINDINGS: Publications are emerging demonstrating a variety of technical approaches and feasibility of clinical application. Techniques for analysis of cell-free DNA including digital PCR, next-generation sequencing and relative haplotype dosage have been used most often for assay development. Analysis of circulating fetal cells in the maternal blood is still being investigated as a viable alternative and more recently transcervical trophoblast cells. Studies exploring ethical and social issues are generally positive but raise concerns around the routinization of prenatal testing.\nSUMMARY: Further work is necessary to make testing available to all patients with a pregnancy at risk of a single gene disorder, and it remains to be seen if the development of more powerful technologies such as isolation and analysis of single cells will shift the emphasis of noninvasive prenatal diagnosis. As testing becomes possible for a wider range of conditions, more ethical questions will become relevant.",

        "abstract": "Purpose Hereditary factors play an important role in colorectal cancer (CRC) risk, yet the prevalence of germline cancer susceptibility gene mutations in patients with CRC unselected for high-risk features (eg, early age at diagnosis, personal/family history of cancer or polyps, tumor microsatellite instability [MSI], mismatch repair [MMR] deficiency) is unknown. Patients and Methods We recruited 1,058 participants who received CRC care in a clinic-based setting without preselection for age at diagnosis, personal/family history, or MSI/MMR results. All participants underwent germline testing for mutations in 25 genes associated with inherited cancer risk. Each gene was categorized as high penetrance or moderate penetrance on the basis of published estimates of the lifetime cancer risks conferred by pathogenic germline mutations in that gene. Results One hundred five (9.9%; 95% CI, 8.2% to 11.9%) of 1,058 participants carried one or more pathogenic mutations, including 33 (3.1%) with Lynch syndrome (LS). Twenty-eight (96.6%) of 29 available LS CRCs demonstrated abnormal MSI/MMR results. Seventy-four (7.0%) of 1,058 participants carried non-LS gene mutations, including 23 (2.2%) with mutations in high-penetrance genes (five APC, three biallelic MUTYH, 11 BRCA1/2, two PALB2, one CDKN2A, and one TP53), 15 of whom lacked clinical histories suggestive of their underlying mutation. Thirty-eight (3.6%) participants had moderate-penetrance CRC risk gene mutations (19 monoallelic MUTYH, 17 APC*I1307K, two CHEK2). Neither proband age at CRC diagnosis, family history of CRC, nor personal history of other cancers significantly predicted the presence of pathogenic mutations in non-LS genes. Conclusion Germline cancer susceptibility gene mutations are carried by 9.9% of patients with CRC. MSI/MMR testing reliably identifies LS probands, although 7.0% of patients with CRC carry non-LS mutations, including 1.0% with BRCA1/2 mutations.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Previous studies have reported an association between polymorphisms in Il17A and IL17F genes and the prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in Caucasian populations. The aim of the current study was to investigate that polymorphisms in both genes may affect RA susceptibility in the Tunisian population and to study the relation between serum IL-17 levels and synovial fluid (SF) levels and risk in RA patients. We suggested also that these polymorphisms may influence response to treatment in Tunisian RA patients.\nMETHODS: We studied IL17A-152 G/A (rs2275913), IL17F 7488 A/G (rs763780) and IL17F 7383 A/G polymorphisms in a Tunisian population. The genotypic and allelic distributions of IL-17A and IL-17F genes polymorphisms were analyzed by Polymerase Chain-Reaction (PCR) and Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) for 108 patients and 202 healthy controls. IL-17 levels were measured in synovial fluid (SF) and in serum of both 108 patients and 47 controls (pg/ml) using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique.\nRESULTS: Our results indicated that IL17F 7488 A/G and IL17F 7383 A/G polymorphisms were significantly associated with RA risk in the whole population. However, IL17A-152 G/A polymorphism did not show any significant association with RA prevalence in the Tunisian population. Stratification according to demographic and clinical features revealed differential significant associations of IL17A-152 G/A, IL17F 7488 A/G and IL17F 7383 A/G polymorphisms within different subgroups and subtypes of clinical-pathologic features in RA patients. IL17A-152 G/A polymorphism was associated with an enhanced response to biologic and MTX treatment. IL17F 7383 A/G polymorphism was associated with an enhanced response to biologic treatment. The IL17F 7488 A/G polymorphism decreased significantly good response to biologic treatment, but enhanced response to MTX treatment. The expression of IL-17 in serum and synovial fluid (SF) in RA patients was significantly higher than that observed in healthy controls (P<0.0001) and their levels depend on RA severity. The mean IL-17 levels in the anti-TNF \u03b1 treated patients decreased significantly at 0 week, 14 weeks and 30 weeks (P=0.0032 and P<0.0001, respectively).\nCONCLUSIONS: Our results confirmed IL17A and IL17F as potential candidate genes involved in RA. They play pivoting roles in the susceptibility and in clinical features of RA disease. Responses to RA treatments are differently conditioned by polymorphisms in IL17A and IL17F genes.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The primary aim of this article is to test the hypothesis that nonparametric pharmacometric modeling will accurately identify CYP2B6 genotype subgroups based on data from a study that reported results based on parametric pharmacokinetics (PK).\nMETHODS: Propofol concentration-time data were originally reported in the Kansaku et al. 2011 publication. Nonparametric Nonlinear Mixed Effects Modeling (NLME) was conducted using the PMETRICS R package while population pharmacokinetic model parameters were estimated using a FORTRAN compiler. Finally, model-based dosing simulations were conducted in the MATLAB Simbiology.\nRESULTS: A total of 51 patients were included in the final PK analysis. A two-compartment gamma multiplicative error model adequately described the propofol concentration-time data. The precision of the goodness-of-fit plots resulted in an R2 of 0.927 and an R2 of 0.992 for the population prediction and individual predictions, respectively. Neither the UGT1A9 nor the CYP2B6 G516T gene variants resulted in statistically significant PK parameter differences while the CYP2B6 A785G gene variants resulted in statistically significant differences for the elimination rate. Model-based dosing-simulations comparing patients with the CYP2B6 AA &amp; AG genotypes to both GG genotypes and patients from a multicenter trial suggest a 50% decrease in propofol infusion dose, to 25mg/kg/min, be made to result in approximately equivalent drug exposures.\nCONCLUSION: Based on the pharmacometric modeling and simulation, if no dosage adjustments are made for the elderly CYP2B6 AA and AG genotypes, a 250% higher propofol blood exposure will be evident within 1-hour from the start of the infusion. Thus, based on the pharmacokinetic model, genotyping elderly patients for the CYP2B6 AA and AG gene variants will decrease the total propofol blood exposure during anesthesia and sedation when an infusion dose adjustment is made to 25mg/kg/min.",

Identifying single nucleotide variants (SNVs) that contribute to differences in drug response and understanding their underlying mechanisms are fundamental to successful implementation of the precision medicine model. This work reports an effort to collect, classify and analyze SNVs that may affect the optimal response to currently approved drugs.\nRESULTS: An integrated approach was taken involving data mining across multiple information resources including databases containing drugs, drug targets, chemical structures, protein-ligand structure complexes, genetic and clinical variations as well as protein sequence alignment tools.

Clinical significance of only 9.56% of the SNVs is known in ClinVar, although 79.02% are predicted as deleterious. The examples here demonstrate that even if the mapped SNVs predicted as deleterious may not result in significant structural modifications, they can plausibly modify the protein-drug interactions, affecting selectivity and drug-binding affinity. Our analysis identifies potentially deleterious SNVs present on drug-binding residues that are relevant for further studies in the context of precision medicine.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Data are available from Supplementary information file.\nCONTACT: yanli.wang@nih.gov.\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary Tables S1-S5 are available at Bioinformatics online.",

The advancements in our understanding of the genetics and epigenetics leading to BWS has evolved over time, and has led to the development of genotype/phenotype correlations. As tumor risk appears to correlate with genetic and epigenetic causes of BWS, several groups have proposed alterations to tumor screening protocols based on the etiology of BWS, with the elimination of AFP as a screening measure and the elimination of all screening measures in BWS patients with loss of methylation at the KCNQ1OT1:TSS-DMR 2 (IC2).

The two main polymorphism loci of CYP2C19 gene were detected by the CYP2C19 genetic testing. ADP platelet aggregation technology was used to investigate the correlation between clinical effect and the clopidogrel dose, genetic metabolic type, physiological, pathological and other factors, to provide new ideas for clopidogrel therapy for percutaneous coronary intervention postoperation patients.\nMETHODS: A total of 48 patients were enrolled. All patients were given clopidogrel routine maintenance dose treatment and underwent CYP2C19 genotyping and platelet function testing. Patients were divided into extensive metabolizers, intermediate metabolizers, and poor metabolizers based on the different CYP2C19 genotypes. The clopidogrel dosage was adjusted to double the maintenance dose for the ineffective patients.\nRESULTS: The study showed that all patients had no toxic side effects. The low responsiveness to clopidogrel in patients with diabetes is closely related to insulin resistance. Patients with hypertension and hyperlipidemia may increase the risk of clopidogrel resistance. The occurrence of clopidogrel resistance is associated with the CYP2C19 polymorphism in the < 65-year-old female patients.\nCONCLUSIONS: For percutaneous coronary intervention in postoperative patients, research data is still lacking regarding clopidogrel dosage on the basis of different CYP2C19 genotypes. Looking forward, more rigorous research programs need to be designed to bring more guidance for clinical application.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Patients with hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma (HLRCC) resulting from fumarate hydratase (FH) mutations may present with skin, uterine, and renal tumors, with each having unique pathologic features. This study investigated the association between prospectively identified suspicious pathology (SP) and FH mutations when patients were referred for genetic testing.\nMETHODS: This was an institutional review board-approved cohort study of patients receiving FH testing from 2008 to 2013. SP was defined as a report of HLRCC histologic features identified during a prospective pathologic assessment. The association between SP and FH mutations was analyzed.\nRESULTS: FH testing was performed in 29 patients with a median age of 37 years; 15 (52%) were female, and 18 (62%) were white. Pathologists reported SP from kidney tumors (11 of 18), leiomyomas (9 of 15: uterus [n = 8] and bladder [n = 1]), and metastatic tumors (3 of 6) in 23 of 39 associated specimens (59%) from 21 of the 29 patients (72%). Patients with SP were younger (35 vs 51 years; P = .010), and those with kidney tumors more often had stage pT3 or higher renal cell carcinoma than those without SP (100% vs 33%; P = .006). FH mutations were present in 8 patients with SP (38%) and in 1 patient without SP (13%; P = .37); 7 of these patients had kidney cancer (n for SP = 7), all with N1 disease. Analyzing SP by tissue type identified only SP from renal tumors as being significantly associated with positive testing for an FH mutation (P = .013).\nCONCLUSIONS: SP from kidney tumors was statistically associated with FH mutations. An expert pathologic assessment of renal tumors will facilitate the clinical identification of HLRCC cases, and this will result in genetic testing and targeted cancer screening for patients and at-risk family members.

Method: The number of all live births, newborn screened infants and all clinical data of confirmed newborns with GAL from October 2013 to March 2015 were retrospectively analyzed by reviewing the data of Zhejiang Province screening center database. And the characteristics of genes and the clinical data of GAL cases who were confirmed by correlative gene test and enzyme activity measurement were analyzed. Result: The prevalence of GAL in Zhejiang province was 1/189 857. Among them, there was 1 case confirmed with GAL type\u2160 (prevalence, 1/759 428), with mutations of c. 904+ 1G&gt;T and c. 687G&gt;A, the enzyme activity of galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (GALT) was 56.4% of controls. And there was 1 case of GAL type\u2161(prevalence, 1/759 428), with mutations of c. 85G&gt;T and c. 502G&gt;A. There were 2 cases confirmed with GAL type \u2162(prevalence, 1/379 714), with mutations of c. 505C&gt;T, c. 452G&gt;A, c. 280G&gt;A and c. 925G&gt;A, the enzyme activity of UDP-galactose-4'-epimerase (GALE) were 42% and 38% of controls, respectively. All cases had different abnormal biochemical marks of liver function, and 1 case had combined hyperlactacidemia or hyperammonemia or increase of multiple kinds of amino acids, respectively. The newborn of GAL type \u2161 had phacoscotasmus before treatment. All the cases were fed with lactose free milk powder, and all the abnormal parameters were improved during following up. Conclusion: The disease of GAL is rare in Zhejiang province, and its genotype distribution is scattered with comparatively mind clinical manifestations, and the cases with early treatment with lactose free milk powder have good prognosis. All cases needed to be treated and followed up for a life-long time. It is recommended that the high risk cases with GAL should be screened as soon as possible.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Targeted screening interventions for chronic kidney disease (CKD) are increasingly being implemented in various community settings. However, the overall success of these programs is uncertain. Therefore, the aim of this review is to determine whether targeted screening is effective in detecting people with undiagnosed CKD.\nMETHODS: We performed a systematic literature review, and included studies of targeted screening intervention implemented in any community-based setting. Studies were required to have targeted people aged\u2009\u226518 years, and multiple CKD risk factors from the following: diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease and family history of kidney disease. The outcome measures were percentages of participants with positive screening test results and diagnosed with CKD at follow-up.\nRESULTS: Nine studies met the inclusion criteria. Eight studies reported the percentage of participants with positive screening test results, which ranged from 7 to 60.3%. Only two studies repeated the diagnostic tests to detect CKD, and confirmed the chronicity of CKD in 20.5 and 17.1% of screened participants. The most commonly used screening tests were albumin creatinine ratio (\u22653.4\u00a0mg/mmol), and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (&lt;60\u00a0ml/min/1.73\u00a0m2). All studies classified CKD stage 3 and above based on eGFR alone. Characteristics of the interventions responsible for inconsistencies in the outcome measures included CKD risk factors targeted, and screening tests used to detect CKD.\nCONCLUSIONS: This systematic review found significant variation in the methods that were used to detect CKD, with the majority of studies reporting results based on only single albuminuria or eGFR values. Future targeted screening programs should appropriately use the 2012 KDIGO guidelines in order to detect CKD, which is necessary to determine the benefit of these programs when implemented in community-settings.",

        "abstract": "While selectively quantifying acylcarnitines in thousands of patient samples using UHPLC-MS/MS, we have occasionally observed unidentified branched-chain C8 acylcarnitines. Such observations are not possible using tandem MS methods, which generate pseudo-quantitative acylcarnitine \"profiles\". Since these \"profiles\" select for mass alone, they cannot distinguish authentic signal from isobaric and isomeric interferences. For example, some of the samples containing branched-chain C8 acylcarnitines were, in fact, expanded newborn screening false positive \"profiles\" for medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MCADD). Using our fast, highly selective, and quantitatively accurate UHPLC-MS/MS acylcarnitine determination method, we corrected the false positive tandem MS results and reported the sample results as normal for octanoylcarnitine (the marker for MCADD). From instances such as these, we decided to further investigate the presence of branched-chain C8 acylcarnitines in patient samples. To accomplish this, we synthesized and chromatographically characterized several branched-chain C8 acylcarnitines (in addition to valproylcarnitine): 2-methylheptanoylcarnitine, 6-methylheptanoylcarnitine, 2,2-dimethylhexanoylcarnitine, 3,3-dimethylhexanoylcarnitine, 3,5-dimethylhexanoylcarnitine, 2-ethylhexanoylcarnitine, and 2,4,4-trimethylpentanoylcarnitine. We then compared their behavior with branched-chain C8 acylcarnitines observed in patient samples and demonstrated our ability to chromographically resolve, and thus distinguish, octanoylcarnitine from branched-chain C8 acylcarnitines, correcting false positive MCADD results from expanded newborn screening.",

The resulting repository of multi-dimensional data can be used for precision medicine analysis of physiological readouts, acute medical conditions, and adverse events that can occur during surgery.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: A structured pipeline was developed atop our existing anesthesia data warehouse using open-source tools. The pipeline is automated using scheduled tasks. The pipeline runs weekly, and finds and identifies all new and existing anesthetic records for BioMe participants.\nRESULTS: The pipeline went live in June 2015 with 49.2% (n=15,673) of BioMe participants linked to 40,947 anesthetics. The pipeline runs weekly in minimal time. After eighteen months, an additional 3671 participants were enrolled in BioMe and the number of matched anesthetic records grew 21% to 49,545. Overall percentage of BioMe patients with anesthetics remained similar at 51.1% (n=18,128). Seven patients opted out during this time. The median number of anesthetics per participant was 2 (range 1-144). Collectively, there were over 35 million physiologic data points and 480,000 medication administrations linked to genomic data. To date, two projects are using the pipeline at MSHS.\nCONCLUSION: Automated integration of biobank and anesthetic data sources is feasible and practical. This integration enables large-scale genomic analyses that might inform variable physiological response to anesthetic and surgical stress, and examine genetic factors underlying adverse outcomes during and after surgery.",

Mayo Clinic Bipolar Biobank samples were collected from 2009 to 2013. Genotyping and analyses for the present study took place from 2013 to 2014. The diagnosis of BD was based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision criteria. Eight single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), previously reported in genome-wide association studies to be associated with BD, were chosen for GRS analysis in early-onset bipolar disease. These SNPs map to 3 genes: CACNA1C (calcium channel, voltage-dependent, L type, alpha 1C subunit), ANK3 (ankyrin-3, node of Ranvier [ankyrin G]), and ODZ4 (teneurin transmembrane protein 4 [formerly \"odz, odd Oz/10-m homolog 4 {Drosophila}, ODZ4\"]). The 8 candidate SNPs were genotyped in patients from the TEAM study (n = 69); adult patients with BD (n = 732), including a subset with early-onset illness (n = 192); and healthy controls (n = 776). GRS analyses were performed to compare early-onset cases with controls. In addition, associations of early-onset BD with individual SNPs and haplotypes were explored.\nRESULTS: GRS analysis revealed associations of the risk score with early-onset BD (P = .01). Gene-level haplotype analysis comparing TEAM patients with controls suggested association of early-onset BD with a CACNA1C haplotype (global test, P = .01). At the level of individual SNPs, comparison of TEAM cases with healthy controls provided nominally significant evidence for association of SNP rs10848632 in CACNA1C with early-onset BD (P = .017), which did not remain significant after correction for multiple comparisons.\nCONCLUSIONS: These preliminary analyses suggest that previously identified BD risk loci, especially CACNA1C, have a role in early-onset BD, possibly with stronger effects than for late-onset BD.",

However, the low yield of DNA available from EBC has hampered the more detailed mutation analysis by conventional methods. We applied the more sensitive amplicon-based next generation sequencing (NGS) to identify cancer related mutations in DNA isolated from EBC. In order to apply any method for the purpose of mutation screening in cancer patients, it is important to clarify the incidence of these mutations in healthy individuals. Therefore, we studied mutations in hotspot regions of 22 cancer genes of 20 healthy, mainly non-smoker individuals, using AmpliSeq colon and lung cancer panel and sequenced on Ion PGM.In 15 individuals, we detected 35 missense mutations in TP53, KRAS, NRAS, SMAD4, MET, CTNNB1, PTEN, BRAF, DDR2, EGFR, PIK3CA, NOTCH1, FBXW7, FGFR3, and ERBB2: these have been earlier reported in different tumor tissues. Additionally, 106 novel mutations not reported previously were also detected. One healthy non-smoker subject had a KRAS G12D mutation in EBC DNA.Our results demonstrate that DNA from EBC of healthy subjects can reveal mutations that could represent very early neoplastic changes or alternatively a normal process of apoptosis eliminating damaged cells with mutations or altered genetic material. Further assessment is needed to determine if NGS analysis of EBC could be a screening method for high risk individuals such as smokers, where it could be applied in the early diagnosis of lung cancer and monitoring treatment efficacy.",

Several allelic variants might, in theory, affect the outcome of vaccination. Objectives: This study was carried out to examine the associations of \u039432 CCR5 and 190G &gt; A CCR2 polymorphisms with a response to a primary course of three HBV vaccinations. Methods: Between December 2014 and December 2016, patients from three randomly selected primary care clinics in the West Pomeranian region (Poland), 1 month after receiving the third dose of HBV vaccine, were enrolled. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) system version 3.0 was used to detect anti-HBs and anti-HBc totals. The identification of polymorphisms were performed by a polymerase chain reaction technique using a single primer extension assay. Genotype distributions of responders versus non-responders to HBV vaccination were compared on the basis of anti-HBs level. Results: In 149 patients (mean age 60 years) the mean anti-HBs level was 652.2 \u00b1 425.9 mIU/mL (range: 0-1111.0 mIU/mL). There were 14.1% (n = 21) non-responders to the HBV vaccine (anti-HBs &lt; 10.0 mIU/mL). The wild type/\u039432 genotype of CCR5 gene was found in 18.1% participants, and 1.3% were \u039432/\u039432 homozygotes. The frequency of allele A of the CCR2 gene was 11.1%. Lower anti-HBs levels in \u039432/\u039432 homozygotes were observed (Me = 61 mIU/mL vs. Me = 660.2 mIU/mL; p = 0.048). As age was found to be a correlate to the anti-HBs titer (r = -0.218, p = 0.0075; 95% CI: -0.366--0.059)-an analysis of a co-variance was performed which found a statistically significant (p = 0.04) difference in anti-HBs titres between \u039432/\u039432 homozygotes and other CCR5 genotypes. The association between anti-HBs titres and CCR2 genotypes was not statistically significant. Conclusions: Our study-which is a preliminary report that suggest this topic deserves further observation with larger sample sizes, different ethnicities, and other single nucleotide poly-morphisms (SNPs)-suggests the possible involvement of CCR5 polymorphism in impairing the immunologic response to HBV vaccination, predominantly in relation to the passage of time.",

The distinguishable salty character of the sweat belonging to individuals suffering from CF makes sweat chloride estimation essential for diagnosis of CF disease.\nAIM: The aim of this prospective study was to elucidate the relationship of sweat chloride levels with clinical features and pattern of CF.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 182 patients, with clinical features of CF were included in this study for quantitative measurement of sweat chloride. Sweat stimulation and collection involved pilocarpine iontophoresis based on the Gibson and Cooks methodology. The quantitative estimation of chloride was done by Schales and Schales method with some modifications. Cystic Fibrosis Trans Membrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) mutation status was recorded in case of patients with borderline sweat chloride levels to correlate the results and for follow-up.\nRESULTS: Out of 182 patients having clinical features consistent with CF, borderline and elevated sweat chloride levels were present in 9 (5%) and 41 (22.5%) subjects respectively. Elevated sweat chloride levels were significantly associated with wheeze, Failure To Thrive (FTT), history of CF in Siblings, product of Consanguineous Marriage (CM), digital clubbing and steatorrhoea on univariate analysis. On multivariate analysis only wheeze, FTT and steatorrhoea were found to be significantly associated with elevated sweat chloride levels (p<0.05). Among the nine borderline cases six cases were positive for at least two CFTR mutations and rest of the three cases were not having any mutation in CFTR gene.\nCONCLUSION: The diagnosis is often delayed and the disease is advanced in most patients at the time of diagnosis. Sweat testing is a gold standard for diagnosis of CF patients as genetic mutation profile being heterozygous and unlikely to become diagnostic test.",

        "abstract": "Deep abdominal vein thrombosis is extremely rare among thrombotic events secondary to the use of contraceptives. A case to illustrate the clinical utility of ethno-specific pharmacogenetic testing in warfarin management of a Hispanic patient is reported. A 37-year-old Hispanic Puerto Rican, non-gravid female with past medical history of abnormal uterine bleeding on hormonal contraceptive therapy was evaluated for abdominal pain. Physical exam was remarkable for unspecific diffuse abdominal tenderness, and general initial laboratory results-including coagulation parameters-were unremarkable. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed a massive thrombosis of the main portal, splenic, and superior mesenteric veins. On admission the patient was started on oral anticoagulation therapy with warfarin at 5 mg/day and low-molecular-weight heparin. The prediction of an effective warfarin dose of 7.5 mg/day, estimated by using a recently developed pharmacogenetic-guided algorithm for Caribbean Hispanics, coincided with the actual patient's warfarin dose to reach the international normalized ratio target. We speculate that the slow rise in patient's international normalized ratio observed on the initiation of warfarin therapy, the resulting high risk for thromboembolic events, and the required warfarin dose of 7.5 mg/day are attributable in some part to the presence of the NQO1*2 (g.559C&gt;T, p.P187S) polymorphism, which seems to be significantly associated with resistance to warfarin in Hispanics. By adding genotyping results of this novel variant, the predictive model can inform clinicians better about the optimal warfarin dose in Caribbean Hispanics. The results highlight the potential for pharmacogenetic testing of warfarin to improve patient care.",

        "abstract": "With recent advances in molecular diagnostic methods and targeted cancer therapies, several molecular tests have been recommended for gastric cancer (GC) and colorectal cancer (CRC). Microsatellite instability analysis of gastrointestinal cancers is performed to screen for Lynch syndrome, predict favorable prognosis, and screen patients for immunotherapy. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor has been approved in metastatic CRCs with wildtype RAS (KRAS and NRAS exon 2-4). A BRAF mutation is required for predicting poor prognosis. Additionally, amplification of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) and MET is also associated with resistance to EGFR inhibitor in metastatic CRC patients. The BRAF V600E mutation is found in sporadic microsatellite unstable CRCs, and thus is helpful for ruling out Lynch syndrome. In addition, the KRAS mutation is a prognostic biomarker and the PIK3CA mutation is a molecular biomarker predicting response to phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors and response to aspirin therapy in CRC patients. Additionally, HER2 testing should be performed in all recurrent or metastatic GCs. If the results of HER2 immunohistochemistry are equivocal, HER2 silver or fluorescence in situ hybridization testing are essential for confirmative determination of HER2 status. Epstein-Barr virus-positive GCs have distinct characteristics, including heavy lymphoid stroma, hypermethylation phenotype, and high expression of immune modulators. Recent advances in next-generation sequencing technologies enable us to examine various genetic alterations using a single test. Pathologists play a crucial role in ensuring reliable molecular testing and they should also take an integral role between molecular laboratories and clinicians.",

BRCA genetic testing is used for HBOC diagnosis and continues to progress such as the annotation of VUS. In HBOC clinical practice, surveillance methods have been established through collaboration between genetic medicine and cancer medicine, and treatment, including options based on genetic diagnosis, has advanced significantly. Furthermore, the analysis of BRCA1 and BRCA2 function has progressed, and a novel therapeutic method based on synthetic lethality, such as a PARP inhibitor use, has been developed. Furthermore, BRCA genetic testing is going to be used as a PGx test for the selection of sensitive cases. Meanwhile, familial breast cancer and ovarian cancer, in which cases of breast and ovarian cancer accumulate in the family, vary from some patients carrying a single mutated gene, such as BRCA1, to families that have multifactorial predisposing causes. Responsible genes of each group have been identified as high, moderate, and low susceptibility genes, and there are a number of cases where the responsible genes are unknown. Such genes need to be identified and a new diagnostic system needs to be established.",

In addition, prognosis did not differ according to surgical methods. Therefore, breast-conserving surgery for HBOC is not an absolute contraindication, although the risk of developing new primary tumors in the long term should be carefully considered. For the contralateral breast, 3 choices are available, surveillance, chemo-prevention, and risk-reducing mastectomy. Risk-reducing mastectomy is known to decrease the risk of breast cancer by 90%.

We have very little information on exact prevalence of patients with FH in the Central, Eastern and Southern Europe (CESE) region. The aim of the study was to describe the epidemiological situation in the CESE region from data available.\nMETHODS: All local leaders of the ScreenPro FH project were asked to provide local data on (a) expert guess of FH prevalence (b) the medical facilities focused on FH already in place (c) the diagnostic criteria used (d) the number of patients already evidenced in local database and (e) the availability of therapeutic options (especially plasma apheresis).\nRESULTS: With the guess prevalence of FH around 1 : 500, we estimate the overall population of 588\u202f363 FH heterozygotes in the CESE region. Only 14\u202f108 persons (2.4 %) were depicted in local databases; but the depiction rate varied between 0.1 % and 31.6 %. Only four out of 17 participating countries reported the the LDL apheresis availability.\nCONCLUSION: Our data point to the large population of heterozygous FH patients in the CESE region but low diagnostic rate. However structures through the ScreenPro FH project are being created and we can hope that the results will appear soon.Key words: diagnosis - epidemiology - familial hypercholesterolemia - screening.",

Information about carrier screening should be provided to every pregnant woman. Carrier screening and counseling ideally should be performed before pregnancy because this enables couples to learn about their reproductive risk and consider the most complete range of reproductive options. A patient may decline any or all screening. When an individual is found to be a carrier for a genetic condition, his or her relatives are at risk of carrying the same mutation. The patient should be encouraged to inform his or her relatives of the risk and the availability of carrier screening. If an individual is found to be a carrier for a specific condition, the patient's reproductive partner should be offered testing in order to receive informed genetic counseling about potential reproductive outcomes. If both partners are found to be carriers of a genetic condition, genetic counseling should be offered.

We aim to elaborate a model to stratify the risk of CRC by incorporating environmental data and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP). The MCC-Spain case-control study included 1336 CRC cases and 2744 controls. Subjects were interviewed on lifestyle factors, family and medical history. Twenty-one CRC susceptibility SNPs were genotyped. The environmental risk model, which included alcohol consumption, obesity, physical activity, red meat and vegetable consumption, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use, contributed to CRC with an average per factor OR of 1.36 (95% CI 1.27 to 1.45). Family history of CRC contributed an OR of 2.25 (95% CI 1.87 to 2.72), and each additional SNP contributed an OR of 1.07 (95% CI 1.04 to 1.10). The risk of subjects with more than 25 risk alleles (5th quintile) was 82% higher (OR 1.82, 95% CI 1.11 to 2.98) than subjects with less than 19 alleles (1st quintile). This risk model, with an AUROC curve of 0.63 (95% CI 0.60 to 0.66), could be useful to stratify individuals.

Its early detection and treatment reduces coronary morbidity and mortality. Despite effective treatment being available, FH is under-diagnosed and under-treated. Identification of index cases and cascade screening using LDL-c levels and genetic testing are the most cost-effective strategies for detecting new cases and starting early treatment. Long-term treatment with statins has decreased the vascular risk to the levels of the general population. LDL-c targets are < 130 mg/dL for children and young adults, <100mg/dL for adults, and < 70 mg/dL for adults with known coronary heart disease or diabetes. Most patients do not to reach these goals, and combined treatments with ezetimibe or other drugs may be necessary. When the goals are not achieved with the maximum tolerated drug treatment, a reduction \u2265 50% in LDL-c levels can be acceptable.

This study examined levels of public awareness of DTC genetic testing, sources of information about testing, and psychosocial factors associated with awareness of testing in the USA. Data were obtained from the nationally representative 2013 U.S. Health Information National Trends Survey. Guided by a social-cognitive conceptual framework, univariable and multivariable logistic regressions were conducted to identify factors associated with awareness of DTC genetic tests. Of 3185 participants, 35.6% were aware of DTC genetic tests, with the majority learning about these tests through radio, television, and the Internet. In the final adjusted model, participants with annual incomes of $99,999 or less had lower odds of being aware of DTC genetic testing (ORs ranging from 0.46-0.61) than did those participants with incomes of $100,000 or more.

Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and gene therapy (GT) are curative treatment options. The objective of the study was to assess the morbidity, mortality, and diagnostic and therapeutic delay in children with SCID in the Netherlands in the last 15 years. These data may help to judge whether SCID should be considered to be included in our national neonatal screening program. In the period 1998-2013, 43 SCID patients were diagnosed in the Netherlands, 11 of whom were atypical SCID (presentation beyond the first year). The median interval between the first symptom and diagnosis was 2 months (range 0-1173 months). The total mortality was 42 %. In total, 32 patients were treated with HSCT of whom 8 were deceased. Nine patients died due to severe infectious complications before curative treatment could be initiated.\nCONCLUSION: Because of a high mortality of patients with SCID before HSCT could be initiated, only a national newborn screening program and pre-emptive HSCT or GT will be able to improve survival of these patients. \"WHAT IS KNOWN\": \u2022 SCID is a fatal disease if a curative hematopoietic stem cell transplantation cannot be performed in time. \u2022 Newborn screening for SCID enables early diagnosis in the asymptomatic phase. \"WHAT IS NEW\": \u2022 Nine out of 43 SCID patients in the Netherlands died due to severe infectious complications before curative treatment could be initiated. \u2022 Only newborn screening and pre-emptive curative therapy will improve survival of children with SCID in the Netherlands.",

Challenges related to participant understanding included varying levels of general and genomic literacy, difficulty managing participant expectations, and contextual factors that impeded participant understanding. Challenges related to facilitating decision-making included complicated family dynamics such as disagreement or coercion, situations in which it was unclear whether sequencing research would be a good use of participant time or resources, and situations in which the professional experienced disagreement or discomfort with participant decisions.

Following appropriate informed consent procedures participants were recruited through the Cancer Genetics Service for Wales. Semi-structured interviews were conducted face-to-face with seven participants, transcribed in full and analyzed using thematic analysis. The motives for testing and perceived advantages described by participants were similar to those identified in previous studies with older participants, such as increased awareness and knowledge and feeling more in control. However some of the perceived disadvantages were specific to younger women, including feeling pressured to make important life decisions earlier than they would have liked, such as about family planning and risk reducing surgery. Participants also reported feeling abandoned or forgotten because of lack of ongoing clinical contact, or feeling \"stuck waiting\" for screening to begin. However, none felt that these disadvantages were a reason to regret having testing. Findings in this small study suggest that having BRCA 1/2 predictive testing can have positive outcomes for young women even though they may be unable to access interventions such as breast screening. However it may be helpful to encourage young women during pre-test counseling to explore the decisions and choices they may face. These young women could benefit from ongoing support and follow up and increased interaction with healthcare professionals.",

For that purpose, 532 respondents aged 55-65 years completed a Discrete Choice Experiment. Using panel latent class models, the preferences for two screening situation characteristics (the probability of being genetically predisposed and the probability of developing CRC) and screening test characteristics (the frequency of preventive colonoscopies and CRC survival) were estimated. Based on these preferences, respondents' willingness to participate in the three screening initiatives was estimated. Lower-educated respondents and respondents who express serious anxiety and worries found colonoscopy frequency and the probability of developing CRC relatively more important and survival relatively less important compared with higher-educated respondents and respondents who express no anxiety and worries. These differences in preferences resulted in opposite preferences for participation in FCC and FAP screening. In conclusion, the general population is willing to participate in genetic screening for CRC. If individuals are suspected of genetic or familial CRC, they should at least be informed about their increased risk of being genetically predisposed and about the importance of participating in all preventive follow-up colonoscopies in order to maximize survival.",

The study included 203 respondents, who answered a structured self-report questionnaire. They were recruited using a snowball method, which increased the participation of Israeli Arabs in the sample, although the sample was not representative of the Israeli population as a whole (there were more Arabs and fewer men). The respondents in this study expressed a positive attitude toward genetic technologies, but were less in favor of using genetic tools for non-medical purposes. Respondents of both groups were not knowledgeable of genetics; however, they scored higher on the items related to reproductive risk, which suggests that some awareness about genetic risk exists in both sectors of the Israeli population. Nevertheless, Israeli Arabs were less positive than Israeli Jews regarding the application of genetic tools. Moreover, although an understanding of genetics correlated positively with the attitude among Arabs, it did not affect the attitude of Jews, who remained very positive, regardless of their level of understanding. This result suggests that other social and cultural factors, besides understanding, might be at work among these two major ethnic sectors.

Using a discussion guide, a trained qualitative moderator facilitated the audio-recorded focus groups. Sixteen individuals participated. Thematic analysis of transcripts started with a grounded approach and subsequently focused on participants' perceptions of the value of genetic information. Analysis uncovered two orientations toward genomic preconception carrier screening: \"certain\" individuals desiring all possible screening information; and \"hesitant\" individuals who were more cautious about its value. Participants revealed valuable information about barriers to screening: fear/anxiety about results; concerns about the method of returning results; concerns about screening necessity; and concerns about partner participation.

Alternatively, a two-tier approach consisting of first, biochemical testing (serum very-long chain fatty acids and leukocyte lysosomal enzyme testing), and then with NGS for remaining undiagnosed patients, would have resulted in total cohort charges of $361,309. We have determined the charges directly associated with diagnostic testing in a population cohort of children with leukodystrophy. We conclude that appropriately incorporating NGS into diagnostic algorithms could lower charges; reduce time to diagnosis; and reduce amount of testing.",

Empirical evidence regarding its utility is vital. The goals of this study were to characterize the process of whole genome sequencing in a population of medical and basic science professionals undergoing whole genome sequencing as a part of an educational symposium. Thirty-eight individuals completed one or more surveys from the time of informed consent for whole genome sequencing to 3 months post-symposium. The four surveys assessed demographics, decision-making, communication, decision regret, and personal and professional impact. The most prevalent motivation to participate was professional enhancement, followed by curiosity about the technology, and personal health benefits. The most important initial impact concerned medical implications. Over time, however, impact on professional development was greater than on personal health. Anticipated reactions to receiving whole genome sequencing results generally matched participants' actual reactions and decision regret remained low over time. Benefits and risks of whole genome sequencing included medically actionable results and misunderstanding by healthcare providers. Whole genome sequencing generally had a positive impact professionally and personally on participants. Further education of providers and the public about whole genome sequencing and psychosocial support is warranted.",

Multiple linear regression analyses examined the predictive relationship of the independent variables on comparative, absolute and 5-year perceived risk for developing T2D.\nRESULTS: Female adolescents (\u03b2=0.186, p < .05), those with a T2D family history (\u03b2=0.147, p < .05) and BMI (\u03b2=0.315, p < .05), had a positive statistically significant relationship with comparative, absolute, and 5-year T2D risk perceptions. Although most respondents reported behavioral risk factors for developing T2D, behavioral causal belief had no statistically significant (p > .05) association with personal T2D risk assessment.\nCONCLUSIONS: The at-risk participants in this investigation primarily based their T2D risk assessment on non-modifiable factors, possible undervaluing the influence of behavioral risk and protective factors. Future work should seek to improve awareness of the influence of behavioral factors and also seek to increase the perceived risk of not engaging in protective behaviors such as physical activity and weight management.",

We used California population-level data to determine whether early specimens (collected from 12 to 23 hours) would also be considered satisfactory based on screening performance.\nMETHODS: Screening data from California Genetic Disease Screening Program were analyzed for false-negative and false-positive rates in four disease categories: metabolic disorders detectable by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS); congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH); congenital hypothyroidism (CH); and initial immune reactive trypsinogen (IRT) for cystic fibrosis (CF). We compared the rates between the early-collection group (12 to 23 hours) and the standard-collection group (24 to 48 hours).\nRESULTS: No significant difference of false-negative rate was detected between the two collection-timing groups. Early specimens had a significantly higher false-positive rate for CH (0.10 vs. 0.01%) and IRT (1.85 vs. 1.54%) but a lower false-positive rate for MSMS metabolic disorders (0.11 vs. 0.18%) and CAH (0.10 vs. 0.14%).\nCONCLUSION: Newborn specimens collected after 12 hours provided satisfactory screening performance.

The questionnaire described the salient features of six microdeletion and microduplication syndromes of varying penetrance. Women were asked to indicate whether they would choose to test for each condition via an invasive diagnostic procedure, a non-invasive blood test, or not at all. Demographic and obstetrical data were also obtained.\nRESULTS: One hundred twenty-four women returned the questionnaire (response rate 89.2%). More than half of women (50.8%) made distinctions between conditions and would choose a mixture of invasive testing, non-invasive testing, and no testing, depending on the condition. Testing preferences differed based on penetrance and features of the conditions. Prior prenatal testing, ethnicity, and education level were significantly associated (p\u2009<\u20090.05) with testing decisions.\nCONCLUSION: Pregnant women do not perceive all microdeletion and microduplication conditions to be equal, and prenatal testing for such conditions is not always considered an all or none process.

Outcome information was requested for samples reported as aneuploidy detected or suspected for chromosomes 21, 18, or 13; voluntary outcome reporting was encouraged for all discordant outcomes.\nRESULTS: Of 86\u2009658 cases, 85\u2009298 (98.4%) met inclusion criteria for result reporting. Of the 1360 (1.6%) cancellations, only 101 (0.1%) were for technical reasons. Average time to result was 3.3 business days. Aneuploidy was detected or suspected in 2142 (2.5%) samples. For aneuploidy detected cases with known clinical outcomes, the overall positive predictive value (PPV) was 83.5% (608/728); observed PPVs for trisomies 21, 18, and 13 ranged from 50.0 to 92.8%. As individual PPVs are determined by a patient's prior risk, we developed a chart for counseling patients on positive predictive value based on maternal age.\nCONCLUSION: This large-scale report reinforces that noninvasive prenatal testing is a highly accurate screen for fetal aneuploidy in the general obstetric population. Test improvements have facilitated a reduction in failure rates, time to result, and borderline results/unclassifiable results. We have developed a positive predictive value counseling tool to ensure appropriate patient education, counseling, and clinical utilization.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Patients, clinicians, researchers and payers are seeking to understand the value of using genomic information (as reflected by genotyping, sequencing, family history or other data) to inform clinical decision-making. However, challenges exist to widespread clinical implementation of genomic medicine, a prerequisite for developing evidence of its real-world utility.\nMETHODS: To address these challenges, the National Institutes of Health-funded IGNITE (Implementing GeNomics In pracTicE; www.ignite-genomics.org ) Network, comprised of six projects and a coordinating center, was established in 2013 to support the development, investigation and dissemination of genomic medicine practice models that seamlessly integrate genomic data into the electronic health record and that deploy tools for point of care decision making. IGNITE site projects are aligned in their purpose of testing these models, but individual projects vary in scope and design, including exploring genetic markers for disease risk prediction and prevention, developing tools for using family history data, incorporating pharmacogenomic data into clinical care, refining disease diagnosis using sequence-based mutation discovery, and creating novel educational approaches.\nRESULTS: This paper describes the IGNITE Network and member projects, including network structure, collaborative initiatives, clinical decision support strategies, methods for return of genomic test results, and educational initiatives for patients and providers. Clinical and outcomes data from individual sites and network-wide projects are anticipated to begin being published over the next few years.\nCONCLUSIONS: The IGNITE Network is an innovative series of projects and pilot demonstrations aiming to enhance translation of validated actionable genomic information into clinical settings and develop and use measures of outcome in response to genome-based clinical interventions using a pragmatic framework to provide early data and proofs of concept on the utility of these interventions. Through these efforts and collaboration with other stakeholders, IGNITE is poised to have a significant impact on the acceleration of genomic information into medical practice.",

In this study, we performed a population based approach intersecting high-throughput genotype data from Friuli Venezia Giulia (FVG) isolated populations with publically available pharmacogenomics information to estimate the frequency of genotypes correlated with responsiveness to breast cancer treatment thus improving the clinical management of this disease in an efficient and cost effective way.\nMETHODS: A list of 80 variants reported to be related to the efficacy or toxicity of breast cancer drugs was obtained from PharmGKB database. Fourty-one were present in FVG, 1000G European (EUR) and ExAC (Non Finnish European) databases. Their frequency was extracted using PLINK software and the differences tested by Fisher's exact test.\nRESULTS: Statistical analyses revealed that 13 out of the 41 (32 %) variants were significantly different in frequency in our sample as compared to the EUR/ExAC cohorts. For nine variants the available level of evidence (LOE) included polymorphisms related to cyclophosphamide, tamoxifen, doxorubicin, fluorpyrimidine and paclitaxel. In particular, for trastuzumab two variants were detected: (1) rs1801274-G within FCGR2A and associated with decreased efficacy (LOE 2B); (2) rs1136201-G located within ERBB2 and associated with increased toxicity (LOE 3). Both these two variants were underrepresented in the FVG population compared to EUR/ExAC population thus suggesting a high therapeutic index of this drug in our population. Moreover, as regards fluoropyrimidines, the frequency of two polymorphisms within the DPYD gene associated with drug toxicity (e.g., rs2297595-C allele and rs3918290-T allele, LOE 2A and 1, respectively) was extremely low in FVG population thus suggesting that a larger number of FVG patients could benefit from full dosage of fluoropyrimidine therapy.\nCONCLUSIONS: All these findings increase the overall knowledge on the prevalence of specific variants related with breast cancer treatment responsiveness in FVG population and highlight the importance of assessing gene polymorphisms related with cancer medications in isolated communities.",

These data explore the self-reported and physician-assessed levels of patient cancer literacy and factors affecting physicians' choice to use biomarkers in treatment decisions.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: Interviews were conducted via telephone with patients and online with physicians. Physicians had 3-35 years of experience; were treating more than 15 patients/month; and specialized in breast, lung, or colorectal cancer. Patients had received treatment for breast, lung, or colorectal cancer within the previous 5 years.\nRESULTS: Interviews with 895 physicians and 811 patients were completed. Most patients and physicians reported that patients understood that a tumor could be tested to determine what treatment would be most effective (78% and 73%, respectively) and that patients would be willing to participate in a personalized treatment plan. Whereas 85% of patients felt that they understood their treatment when it was explained to them, only 23% of doctors felt that their patients were always fully informed. Most physicians (90%) reported using biomarkers; among the 10% not performing biomarker analysis, the most cited obstacles were local availability, speed of obtaining results, and cost.\nCONCLUSION: These data demonstrate wide global use of biomarker testing but with regional variations reflecting cultural and local practice.

Therefore, it is important to develop risk prediction models to identify high-risk individuals with Barrett's esophagus. Familial aggregation of Barrett's esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma, and the increased risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma for individuals with a family history, raise the necessity of including genetic factors in the prediction model. Methods to determine risk prediction models using both risk covariates and ascertained family data are not well developed.\nMETHODS: We developed a Barrett's Esophagus Translational Research Network (BETRNet) risk prediction model from 787 singly ascertained Barrett's esophagus pedigrees and 92 multiplex Barrett's esophagus pedigrees, fitting a multivariate logistic model that incorporates family history and clinical risk factors. The eight risk factors, age, sex, education level, parental status, smoking, heartburn frequency, regurgitation frequency, and use of acid suppressant, were included in the model. The prediction accuracy was evaluated on the training dataset and an independent validation dataset of 643 multiplex Barrett's esophagus pedigrees.\nRESULTS: Our results indicate family information helps to predict Barrett's esophagus risk, and predicting in families improves both prediction calibration and discrimination accuracy.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our model can predict Barrett's esophagus risk for anyone with family members known to have, or not have, had Barrett's esophagus. It can predict risk for unrelated individuals without knowing any relatives' information.\nIMPACT: Our prediction model will shed light on effectively identifying high-risk individuals for Barrett's esophagus screening and surveillance, consequently allowing intervention at an early stage, and reducing mortality from esophageal adenocarcinoma.

Physicians'/patients' treatment choices and patients' decisional conflict were recorded pre- and post testing.\nRESULTS: The analysis included 137 patients. Overall, adjuvant treatment recommendations changed in 40.7% of patients, with the direction of the change consistent with the Recurrence Score results (net decrease in chemotherapy recommendation rate in low Recurrence Score patients and net increase in high Recurrence Score patients). Patients' choices were generally consistent with physicians' recommendations. Post-testing, patients' decisional conflict decreased significantly (P<0.0001).

This article examines the experiences and attitudes of residents regarding a community-based genomic cohort study.\nMETHODS: This study was conducted as a part of the health survey of the City Health Promotion section. At the conclusion of the first stage of the project, a self-administered questionnaire was mailed to a random sample of 2,500 residents in 2012.\nRESULTS: The response rate was 59 % (n = 1477/2500). The findings show that 70 % of males and 50 % of females knew nothing about the project. Females and elderly people were more likely to have knowledge of the study, indicating that self-rated understanding of the terminology is statistically associated with the level of awareness regarding the project. In addition, those who were aware of the project were also aware of the benefits of research utilizing genetic information, whereas unaware respondents, particularly males, believed that unexpected negative effects may occur. Those with higher self-rated understanding of the terminology and higher awareness of benefit of the research utilizing genetic information had more positive attitudes toward undergoing drug susceptibility genetic testing, indicating that the awareness of project in females and concerns toward genetic research are not statistically associated with the willingness to undergo.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that a community-based genome cohort project helps raise awareness of benefit of genetic research and that knowledge, however, does not directly affect the willingness to participate in related activities, such as drug susceptibility genetic testing.

Consanguineous marriages were reported by 67.5% of the households. The highest percentage of homozygous SCD was 2.8% among children under 5 years of age. About 24.9% were carriers of HbS allele (HbAS). HbS allele frequency was highest in children aged 5-11 years (18.3%, CI: 13.7-22.9%) and lowest in males >15 years old (12.0%, CI: 6.1-17.9%). The average HbS frequency across all age groups was 14.5% (95% CI: 12.2-16.8%). The most frequent \u03b2-globin gene cluster haplotype was the Cameroon (30.8%), followed by the Benin (21.8%), the Senegal (12.8%) and the Bantu (2.2%) haplotypes. About 17.0% of all-cause child deaths were due to SCD. The estimated change in log odds of having the SS genotype per year increase in age was (-) 0.0058 (95% CI -0.0359, 0.0242). This represents a non-statistically significant 2.9% increase in 5-year mortality for individuals with the SS genotype relative to those with AS and AA genotypes. About 46.9% of the households had poor knowledge, 26.1% had satisfactory knowledge, and 26.9% had good knowledge about sickle cell disease. Mothers' and fathers' educational levels were significant predictors of good knowledge about SCD (P < 0.05). About 48.0% had a satisfactory attitude towards sickle cell disease while 30.7% had poor attitude and only 21.3 showed good attitudes. Poor knowledge about SCD and low socio-economic status were the strongest positive predictors of poor attitude and practices towards SCD (P < 0.01).\nCONCLUSIONS: Sickle cell disease is a major health problem in West Kordofan, Sudan. Knowledge, attitude and practices towards the disease are not satisfactory. The development of public health programs is highly recommended to control and manage SCD in western parts of Sudan.",

        "abstract": "Specific patterns of the hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) syndrome are related to mutations in the BRCA1 gene. One hundred unrelated breast cancer patients were interviewed to obtain clinical symptoms and signs, pedigree and familial history of HBOC syndrome related cancer. Subsequently, data were calculated using the Breast and Ovarian Analysis of Disease Incidence and Carrier Estimation Algorithm (BOADICEA) risk prediction model. Patients with high score of BOADICEA were offered genetic testing. Eleven patients with high score of BOADICEA, 2 patients with low score of BOADICEA, 2 patient's family members and 15 controls underwent BRCA1 genetic testing. Mutation screening using PCR-HRM was carried out in 22 exons (41 amplicons) of BRCA1 gene. Sanger sequencing was subjected in all samples with aberrant graph. This study identified 10 variants in the BRCA1 gene, consisting of 6 missense mutations (c.1480C>A, c.2612C>T, c.2566T>C, c.3113A>G, c.3548 A>G, c.4837 A>G), 3 synonymous mutations (c.2082 C> T, c.2311 T> C and c.4308T>C) and one intronic mutation (c.134+35 G>T). All variants tend to be polymorphisms and unclassified variants. However, no known pathogenic mutations were found.",

        "abstract": "KRAS mutant non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) vary in clinical outcome depending on which specific KRAS mutation is present. Shorter progression free survival has been associated with KRAS variants G12C and G12V. Cell lines with these variants depend to a greater extent on the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway and become more susceptible to MEK inhibition. Because different KRAS mutations may lead to altered drug sensitivity, we aimed to determine specific KRAS mutation status in a NSCLC patient cohort at our institution. A total of 502 NSCLC samples were screened for somatic mutations using the 50 gene AmpliSeq\u2122 Cancer Hotspot Panel v2 (CHPv2). However only samples positive for variants in the KRAS gene were included in this study. Variants identified in the KRAS genes were curated using publicly available databases. The overall mutation rate in the KRAS gene was 32.7% (164/502). The most common KRAS mutations were G12C (41%), G12V (19%), and G12D (14%) along with less frequent variants. After re-mining our sequencing data, we found that more than a half of our KRAS mutant NSCLC patients could potentially benefit from the addition of a MEK inhibitor such as selumetinib to standard chemotherapeutic agents. Due to mutated KRAS, these patients will likely fail traditional anti-EGFR therapies but be eligible for newer combination therapies.",

However, the general practice in European research projects is that results are usually not provided to research participants for many reasons. This article reports on the views of European experts and scholars who are members of the European COST Action CHIP ME IS1303 (Citizen's Health through public-private Initiatives: Public health, Market and Ethical perspectives) regarding challenges to the feedback of individual genetic results to research participants in Europe and potential strategies to address these challenges.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: A consultation of the COST Action members was conducted through an email survey and a workshop. The results from the consultation were analyzed following a conventional content analysis approach.\nRESULTS: Legal frameworks, professional guidelines, and financial, organizational, and human resources to support the feedback of results are largely missing in Europe. Necessary steps to facilitate the feedback process include clarifying legal requirements to the feedback of results, developing harmonized European best practices, promoting interdisciplinary and cross-institutional collaboration, designing educational programs and cost-efficient IT-based platforms, involving research ethics committees, and documenting the health benefits and risks of the feedback process.\nCONCLUSIONS: Coordinated efforts at pan-European level are needed to enable equitable, scientifically sound, and socially robust feedback of results to research participants.",

Hypotheses were generated from a simple health economics model and tested against individual-level panel data from the Australasian Colorectal Cancer Family Registry.\nRESULTS: The empirical analysis revealed evidence consistent with some of the hypotheses, with a higher likelihood of undergoing colonoscopy in those who discovered their genetic predisposition to colorectal cancer and a lower likelihood of quitting smoking in those who discovered their lack thereof.\nCONCLUSIONS: Predictive genetic information about Lynch syndrome was associated with change in individual colonoscopy and smoking behaviors but not necessarily in ways to improve population health.\nIMPACT: The study findings suggest that the impact of personalized medicine on disease prevention is intricate, warranting further analyses to determine the net benefits and costs.

However, 167 of 462 patients (36%) had not registered with a Hereditary Cancer Clinic in NSW/ACT, including 11 women with high-grade serous ovarian cancer and seven women with abnormal MMR immunohistochemistry. Mutations were identified in 40 of 165 women (24%) undergoing breast cancer BRCA1/2 testing and in ten of 25 women (40%) who underwent MMR genetic testing. Eighty-one first- or second-degree relatives of these women have undergone predictive testing, identifying 48 mutation carriers and 33 non-carriers.\nCONCLUSION: Changing indications and increased participation by a genetic consultant in the weekly MDT meeting has led to increasing genetic referrals over the last five years. Follow up of referrals needs to be addressed. With decreasing costs of genetic testing and use of readily transportable DNA collected through saliva or mouth swabs, we propose that distance should not be a barrier to this model being extended to all centres providing care to gynaecological cancer patients.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: For more than a decade, risk stratification for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy has been enhanced by targeted genetic testing. Using sequencing results, clinicians routinely assess the risk of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in a patient's relatives and diagnose the condition in patients who have ambiguous clinical presentations. However, the benefits of genetic testing come with the risk that variants may be misclassified.\nMETHODS: Using publicly accessible exome data, we identified variants that have previously been considered causal in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and that are overrepresented in the general population. We studied these variants in diverse populations and reevaluated their initial ascertainments in the medical literature. We reviewed patient records at a leading genetic-testing laboratory for occurrences of these variants during the near-decade-long history of the laboratory.\nRESULTS: Multiple patients, all of whom were of African or unspecified ancestry, received positive reports, with variants misclassified as pathogenic on the basis of the understanding at the time of testing. Subsequently, all reported variants were recategorized as benign. The mutations that were most common in the general population were significantly more common among black Americans than among white Americans (P<0.001). Simulations showed that the inclusion of even small numbers of black Americans in control cohorts probably would have prevented these misclassifications. We identified methodologic shortcomings that contributed to these errors in the medical literature.\nCONCLUSIONS: The misclassification of benign variants as pathogenic that we found in our study shows the need for sequencing the genomes of diverse populations, both in asymptomatic controls and the tested patient population. These results expand on current guidelines, which recommend the use of ancestry-matched controls to interpret variants. As additional populations of different ancestry backgrounds are sequenced, we expect variant reclassifications to increase, particularly for ancestry groups that have historically been less well studied.

A review of all carriers of the BRCA mutation diagnosed with breast cancer at the Genetics Institute of a tertiary medical center in 2000-2013 yielded 80 women who could be paired with a mother with breast cancer who was either a carrier of the BRCA mutation or an obligate carrier according to pedigree analysis. Age at diagnosis, type of mutation (BRCA1, BRCA2), year of birth, and ethnicity were recorded. Paired t-test was used to analyze differences in age at cancer diagnosis between groups and subgroups. Mean age at diagnosis of breast cancer was 50.74 years (range 22-88) in the mothers and 43.85 years (range 24-75) in the daughters. The difference was statistically significant (p < 0.001). These findings were consistent regardless of type of BRCA mutation, ethnicity, or mother's year of birth. However, on separate analysis of pairs in which the mother was diagnosed before the age of 50 years, there was no significant difference in mean age at diagnosis between mothers and daughters (~42 years for both). Daughters who carry a BRCA mutation are diagnosed with breast cancer at an earlier age than their carrier mothers, with the exception of pairs in which the mother was diagnosed before the age of 50 years.

BCFH-positive girls had higher breast cancer-specific distress than BCFH-negative girls (P < .001), but girls from BRCA1/2-positive families did not differ from other BCFH-positive peers. BCFH-positive girls were more likely to report themselves at increased self-risk for breast cancer in adulthood than BCFH-negative peers (74% v 33%, respectively; P \u2264 .001). Girls from BRCA1/2-positive families were more likely than other BCFH-positive and BCFH-negative peers to report themselves at increased risk (P < .001). In all groups, perceived risk of breast cancer was associated with older age. Higher breast cancer-specific distress among adolescent girls was associated with higher self-perceived risk of breast cancer and higher maternal breast cancer-specific distress.\nCONCLUSION: Adolescent girls from BRCA1/2-positive and breast cancer families have higher self-esteem and do not have poorer psychosocial adjustment than peers. However, they do experience greater breast cancer-specific distress and perceived risk of breast cancer, particularly among older girls. Understanding the impact is important to optimize responses to growing up in families at familial and genetic risk for breast cancer, particularly given the debate over the genetic testing of children for cancer susceptibility in adulthood.",

But after a brief introduction, a majority of them were willing to accept genetic counseling and recommend their family members to participate. The willingness was education- and age-related. When told that gene testing may benefit themselves, 92.1% of the patients were willing to be tested. However, when told that gene testing may only benefit their family, only 33.9% of the patients were willing to join the testing. The acceptance was also age-, education- and family income-related. The difference was statistically significant. Moreover, the willingness ratio to participate the gene testing was lower than expected. Overall, 74.1% of the patients were willing to accept cheaper preliminary gene screening, whilst only 19.2% were willing to accept genetic testing of higher price. Despite of being told that testing results will be maintained as confidential, still 43.2% worried about adverse effects. Such patients tended to younger, from low-income families, with a family history of associated cancers, or personal history of other cancers. The difference was statistically significant.\nCONCLUSION: The majorities of patients do not know but are willing to accept genetic counseling and gene testing and recommend their family to participate. Lack of genetic knowledge, cost for the testing and concerns about discrimination are the obstacles for patients to participate in genetic counseling and gene testing. To spread the knowledge about breast cancer and establish a follow-up screening system for high-risk population may improve the tertiary prevention for breast cancer.",

These powerful technologies raise a number of ethical issues in pediatrics, primarily because of the frequent lack of clinical utility of genetic information, the generation of secondary results and questions over the proper scope of parental authority for testing.\nRECENT FINDINGS: Several professional organizations in the fields of genetics and pediatrics have published new guidance on the ethical, legal, and policy issues relevant to genetic testing in children. The roles of predictive testing for adult-onset conditions, the management of secondary findings and the role of informed consent for newborn screening remain controversial. However, research and experience are not demonstrating serious adverse psychosocial impacts from genetic testing and screening in children. The use of these technologies is expanding with the notion that the personal utility of test results, rather than clinical utility, may be sufficient to justify testing.\nSUMMARY: The use of microarray and genome sequencing technologies is expanding in the care of children. More deference to parental decision-making is evolving in contexts wherein information and counseling can be made readily available.",

        "abstract": "Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a leading cause of maternal mortality. Few studies have evaluated the individual risk of gestational VTE associated with heritable thrombophilia, and current recommendations for antenatal thromboprophylaxis in women with severe thrombophilia such as homozygous factor V Leiden mutation (FVL) depend on a positive family history of VTE. To better stratify thromboprophylaxis in pregnancy, we aimed to estimate the individual probability (absolute risk) of gestational VTE associated with thrombophilia and to see whether these risk factors are independent of a family history of VTE in first-degree relatives. We studied 243 women with the first VTE during pregnancy and the puerperium and 243 age-matched normal women. Baseline incidence of VTE of 1:483 pregnancies in women \u226535 years and 1:741 deliveries in women &lt;35 years was assumed, according to a recent population-based study. In women \u226535 years (&lt;35 years), the individual probability of gestational VTE was as follows: 0.7% (0.5%) for heterozygous FVL; 3.4% (2.2%) for homozygous FVL; 0.6% (0.4%) for heterozygous prothrombin G20210A; 8.2% (5.5%) for compound heterozygotes for FVL and prothrombin G20210A; 9.0% (6.1%) for antithrombin deficiency; 1.1% (0.7%) for protein C deficiency; and 1.0% (0.7%) for protein S deficiency. These results were independent of a positive family history of VTE. We provide evidence that unselected women with these thrombophilias have an increased risk of gestational VTE independent of a positive family history of VTE. In contrast to current guidelines, these data suggest that women with high-risk thrombophilia should be considered for antenatal thromboprophylaxis regardless of family history of VTE.",

We identified the prevalence of sickle cell trait (SCT) among pregnant women and their male partners in Enugu State, Nigeria, and determined the accuracy of self-reported sickle cell status and its reliability for identifying high-risk newborns for targeted screening.\nMETHODS: We conducted a nested cohort study of expectant parents enrolled in the Healthy Beginning Initiative (HBI). The HBI is a cluster-randomized trial of a congregation-based approach designed to increase HIV testing. Participants completed a survey regarding self-awareness of their sickle cell genotype and consented to genotype screening by cellulose acetate electrophoresis.\nRESULTS: SCT prevalence (HbAS) was 22% (746/3,371). Only 50% of participants provided an accurate self-report. Self-report accuracy was significantly different (p < 0.0001) between individuals who reported having SCT or SCD (61% accuracy) versus those who reported not having SCT or SCD (86% accuracy). Demographic variables including gender, age, household size, employment, education, and home location were significantly associated with providing an accurate self-report.\nCONCLUSIONS: Low numbers of accurate parental self-reports, coupled with a high SCT prevalence in Nigeria, could limit the efficacy of targeted newborn screening. However, our data indicate that it is feasible to integrate sickle cell screening for pregnant women with existing, community-based health care programs developed by the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), such as the HBI. Expanding screening programs could enable the development of targeted newborn screening based on maternal genotype that could identify all newborns with SCD in resource-limited settings.",

        "abstract": "Genetic predisposition may contribute to the differences in drug-specific, class-specific or antidepressant-wide treatment resistance. Clinical studies with the genetic data are often limited in sample sizes. Drug response obtained from self-reports may offer an alternative approach to conduct a study with much larger sample size. Using the phenotype data collected from 23andMe 'Antidepressant Efficacy and Side Effects' survey and genotype data from 23andMe's research participants, we conducted genome-wide association study (GWAS) on subjects of European ancestry using four groups of phenotypes (a) non-treatment-resistant depression (n=7795) vs treatment-resistant depression (TRD, n=1311), (b) selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) responders (n=6348) vs non-responders (n=3340), (c) citalopram/escitalopram responders (n=2963) vs non-responders (n=2005), and (d) norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI, bupropion) responders (n=2675) vs non-responders (n=1861). Each of these subgroups was also compared with controls (n ~ 190\u2009000). The most significant association was from bupropion responders vs non-responders analysis. Variant rs1908557 (P=2.6 \u00d7 10(-8), OR=1.35) passed the conventional genome-wide significance threshold (P=5 \u00d7 10(-8)) and was located within the intron of human spliced expressed sequence tags in chromosome 4. Gene sets associated with long-term depression, circadian rhythm and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway were enriched in the bupropion analysis. No single-nucleotide polymorphism passed genome-wide significance threshold in other analyses. The heritability estimates for each response group compared with controls were between 0.15 and 0.25, consistent with the known heritability for major depressive disorder.",

Five-year and lifetime risk of developing breast cancer were determined using the Gail model. General linear modeling was applied to determine breast cancer predictors.\nRESULTS: The mean age of the subjects was 42.7 (SD: 7.7) years. Mean 5-year and lifetime risks of developing breast cancer were determined to be 0.6% (SD: 0.2%) and 8.9% (SD: 2.5%), respectively. Variables of family history of breast cancer, age, age at menarche, parity, age at rst childbirth, breastfeeding history, frequency of breastfeeding, method of contraception, marital status and education were all found to be predictors of breast cancer risk.\nCONCLUSIONS: According to the results of this study, screening programs based on the Gail model should be implemented for Iranian people who have a high risk for breast cancer in order to facilitate early detection and better plan for possible malignancies.",

Women were offered screening using a combination of maternal serum pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A, free \u03b2-human chorionic gonadotropin and fetal nuchal translucency thickness. Those with an estimated risk of \u22651 in 250 of carrying a fetus with trisomy 21 or \u22651 in 300 risk of trisomy 18 were offered genetic counseling with the option of an invasive diagnostic test.\nRESULTS: The median of gestational age was 11+3 weeks, the median of crown-rump length was 47.1 mm, and the median age of the women was 31 years. The detection rate was 80% for trisomy 21 (4 of 5) and 100% for trisomy 13 and 18 (all 2). The false-positive rate was 7.73% for trisomy 21 and 1.21% for trisomy 18.\nCONCLUSION: This study was the first large population study performed with the aim of analyzing the performance of the combined test in Korea. This study demonstrated that the detection rates and other figures of the first trimester combined test are comparable to the results reported in other papers worldwide. Consequently, if strict conditions for good screening outcomes are achieved, the first trimester combined test might well be the earliest detectable screening, improving detection rates without increasing karyotyping or economic and other implications that inevitably ensue.",

They were selected to undergo mismatch repair gene mutation analysis using immunohistochemistry (IHC; four markers: MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2) and microsatellite instability (MSI) test. For samples that resulted negative to IHC (abnormal finding), MSI test was performed to further study the suspected mutation. Samples were classified as MSI-high (MSI-H) if more than one marker was identified as unstable; MSI-low (MSI-L) if only one marker was identified as unstable; or MSI-stable (MSI-S) if no marker was identified as unstable. Samples were subdivided into two groups: MSI-H/L and MSI-S. Statistical analysis was performed to assess differences regarding survival, tumor staging, grading, and invasion of lymphovascular space between these two groups.\nRESULTS: IHC analysis showed that in 46% (19/41) of samples there was negative outcome. Forty-two percent (8/19) of these negative samples were unstable (either low or high). Of eight patients showing MSI, 75% were MSI-L, while 25% were MSI-H. Differences in survival, stage, grade, lymphovascular space invasion and Amsterdam criteria adherence were not statistically significant due to the small size of the cohort.\nCONCLUSION: IHC and MSI test results of our cohort lead us to assess the relevance of performing Lynch syndrome genetic screening in endometrial cancer patients aged less than 50 years at the time of diagnosis.",

This has led to an increased number of families seeking genetic testing and / or genetic counselling and increased the clinical load for genetic counsellors (GCs). Keeping pace with biomedical discoveries, interventions are required to support families to understand, communicate and cope with their Inherited Genetic Condition. The Socio-Psychological Research in Genomics (SPRinG) collaborative have developed a new intervention, based on multi-family discussion groups (MFDGs), to support families affected by IGCs and train GCs in its delivery. A potential challenge to implementing the intervention was whether GCs were willing and able to undergo the training to deliver the MFDG. In analysing three multi-perspective interviews with GCs, this paper evaluates the training received. Findings suggests that MFDGs are a potential valuable resource in supporting families to communicate genetic risk information and can enhance family function and emotional well-being. Furthermore, we demonstrate that it is feasible to train GCs in the delivery of the intervention and that it has the potential to be integrated into clinical practice.

HoFH is caused by mutations in several genes, including LDL receptor (LDLR), apolipoprotein B (APOB), proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), and LDL protein receptor adaptor 1 (LDLRAP1). No epidemiological studies have assessed HoFH prevalence or the clinical and molecular characteristics of this condition. Here, we aimed to characterize HoFH in Spain.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Data were collected from the Spanish Dyslipidemia Registry of the Spanish Atherosclerosis Society and from all molecular diagnoses performed for familial hypercholesterolemia in Spain between 1996 and 2015 (n=16\u2009751). Clinical data included baseline lipid levels and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events. A total of 97 subjects were identified as having HoFH-of whom, 47 were true homozygous (1 for APOB, 5 for LDLRAP1, and 41 for LDLR), 45 compound heterozygous for LDLR, 3 double heterozygous for LDLR and PSCK9, and 2 double heterozygous for LDLR and APOB. No PSCK9 homozygous cases were identified. Two variants in LDLR were identified in 4.8% of the molecular studies. Over 50% of patients did not meet the classical HoFH diagnosis criteria. The estimated HoFH prevalence was 1:450\u2009000. Compared with compound heterozygous cases, true homozygous cases showed more aggressive phenotypes with higher LDL-C and more atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events.\nCONCLUSIONS: HoFH frequency in Spain was higher than expected. Clinical criteria would underestimate the actual prevalence of individuals with genetic HoFH, highlighting the importance of genetic analysis to improve familial hypercholesterolemia diagnosis accuracy.",

While BRCA1/BRCA2 genetic testing provides important risk information for some women, panels of more common breast cancer risk genetic variants may have relevance to greater numbers of women with familial risk.\nMETHODS: Three polygenic risk scores (PRS) based on 18 SNPs were investigated in a case-control study of women attending a familial risk clinic. PRS were derived from published general European population allele ORs and frequencies (18-SNPs (SNP18)). In women with BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations, 3 SNPs/13 SNPs, respectively, generated the PRS estimates. In total, 364 incident breast cancer cases (112 with BRCA1/2 mutations) were matched with 1605 controls (691 BRCA1/2) by age last mammogram and BRCA1/2 genetic test result. 87 women with cancer before attendance were also considered. Logistic regression was used to measure PRS performance through ORs per IQR and calibration of the observed to expected (O/E) logarithm relative risk when unadjusted and adjusted for phenotypic risk factors assessed by the Tyrer-Cuzick (TC) model.\nRESULTS: SNP18 was predictive for non-carriers of BRCA1/2 mutations (IQR OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.29 to 1.87, O/E 96%). Findings were unaffected by adjustment from TC (IQR OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.29 to 1.89) or when prior cancers were included (IQR OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.30 to 1.87). There was some evidence to support polygenic scores with weights for individuals with BRCA1/2 mutations (BRCA1 IQR OR 1.44, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.76; BRCA2 IQ OR 1.44, 95% CI 0.90 to 2.31).\nCONCLUSIONS: PRS may be used to refine risk assessment for women at increased familial risk who test negative/have low likelihood of BRCA1/2 mutations.

With full-genome sequencing as the emerging standard for genetic testing, other breast cancer susceptibility genes have been identified and may collectively contribute to up to 30% of all hereditary breast cancers. We re-assessed women who had previously tested negative for a BRCA mutation when outdated techniques were used, and discuss the implications of identifying a mutation several years after initial genetic testing.\nMETHODS: We evaluated the prevalence of mutations in 12 breast cancer susceptibility genes (including BRCA1 and BRCA2) in 190 breast cancer patients with a strong family history of breast cancer. These women had previously tested negative for mutations in the large coding exons of BRCA1 and BRCA2 using the protein truncation test (PTT) between the years of 1996 and 2013.\nRESULTS: We identified pathogenic mutations in 17 of 190 (9%) women. Six mutations were detected in BRCA1 (n\u00a0=\u00a02) and BRCA2 (n\u00a0=\u00a04).

Six of these women were BRCA mutation carriers who were missed previously.

        "abstract": "Single-gene mutations account for more than 6000 diseases, 10% of all pediatric hospital admissions, and 20% of infant deaths. Down syndrome and other aneuploidies occur in more than 0.2% of births worldwide and are on the rise because of advanced reproductive age. Birth defects of genetic origin can be diagnosed in utero after invasive extraction of fetal tissues. Noninvasive testing with circulating cell-free fetal DNA is limited by a low fetal DNA fraction. Both modalities are unavailable until the end of the first trimester. We have isolated intact trophoblast cells from Papanicolaou smears collected noninvasively at 5 to 19 weeks of gestation for next-generation sequencing of fetal DNA. Consecutive matched maternal, placental, and fetal samples (n = 20) were profiled by multiplex targeted DNA sequencing of 59 short tandem repeat and 94 single-nucleotide variant sites across all 24 chromosomes. The data revealed fetal DNA fractions of 85 to 99.9%, with 100% correct fetal haplotyping. This noninvasive platform has the potential to provide comprehensive fetal genomic profiling as early as 5 weeks of gestation.",

        "abstract": "Family history information comprises an important tool in identifying and referring patients at risk for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) to cancer genetic counseling. Despite recommendations and support provided by numerous professional organizations, cancer genetic counseling services are underutilized by atrisk patients. This study aimed to: (1) determine the rate of genetic counseling utilization following a referral letter, (2) characterize factors (barriers and supports) which influenced uptake of services, and (3) identify potential strategies for increasing utilization. This study evaluated the uptake of cancer genetic counseling among 603 screening mammography patients identified as having an increased risk for HBOC based on National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines. At risk individuals and their primary care providers were mailed a referral letter recommending genetic counseling. Three focus groups (N\u00a0=\u00a024) were conducted to identify responses to receiving a letter recommending genetic counseling, barriers to seeking genetic counseling, and facilitating factors to utilizing these services. Participant responses were qualitatively analyzed using thematic and cross case analysis. Within one year, 50/603 (8\u00a0%) of the identified at-risk women completed a genetic counseling appointment. Participant-perceived barriers which influenced their decision not to seek genetic counseling included lack of relevance and utility, limited knowledge about genetic counseling, concerns about the genetic counseling process, and concerns about cost and insurance coverage. Participant-perceived facilitating factors which would support a decision to seek genetic counseling included greater awareness and education about genetic counseling services when receiving a referral, and improved follow up and guidance from their provider. Findings from this study support the need for patient and primary care provider education, and improved provider-patient communication to increase uptake of genetic counseling services.",

LV myocardial deformation parameters of the first-degree relatives with normal LVEF (\u226555%) values, as assessed using 2D echocardiography, were evaluated. The findings of the first-degree relatives were compared with an age- and sex-matched control group (n\u00a0= 86).\nRESULTS: No difference in terms of age, gender, and body surface area was detected between first-degree relatives and controls. First-degree relatives of IDCM patients had significantly lower LVEF (62.04\u00a0\u00b1 5.8% vs. 65.65\u00a0\u00b1 6.3%, p\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.001) and FS values (39.4\u00a0\u00b1 6.6 vs. 41.45\u00a0\u00b1 5.5, p\u00a0= 0.03) compared with the controls.

        "abstract": "Applications of genomic studies are spreading rapidly in many domains of science and technology such as healthcare, biomedical research, direct-to-consumer services, and legal and forensic. However, there are a number of obstacles that make it hard to access and process a big genomic database for these applications. First, sequencing genomic sequence is a time consuming and expensive process. Second, it requires large-scale computation and storage systems to process genomic sequences. Third, genomic databases are often owned by different organizations, and thus, not available for public usage. Cloud computing paradigm can be leveraged to facilitate the creation and sharing of big genomic databases for these applications. Genomic data owners can outsource their databases in a centralized cloud server to ease the access of their databases. However, data owners are reluctant to adopt this model, as it requires outsourcing the data to an untrusted cloud service provider that may cause data breaches. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving model for outsourcing genomic data to a cloud. The proposed model enables query processing while providing privacy protection of genomic databases. Privacy of the individuals is guaranteed by permuting and adding fake genomic records in the database. These techniques allow cloud to evaluate count and top-k queries securely and efficiently. Experimental results demonstrate that a count and a top-k query over 40 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) in a database of 20\u00a0000 records takes around 100 and 150\u00a0s, respectively.",

Research with (older) cancer patients who undergo gastrectomy for curative reasons suggests that gastric resection has a number of physical and psychosocial sequelae. Because it is difficult to extrapolate the findings of studies of older cancer patients to younger healthy patients who are considering prophylactic total gastrectomy (PTG), the aim of this qualitative interview study was to determine the psychosocial implications of undergoing prophylactic surgery to manage genetic risk. Fourteen men and 13 women from the UK's Familial Gastric Cancer study who had undergone PTG were invited to participate in qualitative interviews. Most reported that undergoing surgery and convalescence was easier than anticipated. There was evidence that age affected experiences of PTG, with younger patients tending to report faster recovery times and more transient aftereffects. All saw the benefits of risk reduction as outweighing the costs of surgery. Surgery was described as having a range of physical impacts (disrupted appetite, weight loss, fatigue, GI symptoms) that had related psychological, social and economic implications. Those considering PTG need to be aware that its impact on quality of life is difficult to predict and negative sequelae may be ongoing for some individuals.",

HoFH may cause very premature atheromatous arterial disease and death, despite treatment with Lp apheresis combined with statin, ezetimibe and bile acid sequestrants. Two new classes of drug, effective in lowering cholesterol in HoFH, are now licensed in the United Kingdom. Lomitapide is restricted to use in HoFH but, may cause fatty liver and is very expensive. PCSK9 inhibitors are quite effective in receptor defective HoFH, are safe and are less expensive. Lower treatment targets for lipid lowering in HoFH, in line with those for the general FH population, have been proposed to improve cardiovascular outcomes. HEART UK presents a strategy combining Lp apheresis with pharmacological treatment to achieve these targets in the United Kingdom (UK). Improved provision of Lp apheresis by use of existing infrastructure for extracorporeal treatments such as renal dialysis is promoted. The clinical management of adults and children with HoFH including advice on pregnancy and contraception are addressed. A premise of the HEART UK strategy is that the risk of early use of drug treatments beyond their licensed age restriction may be balanced against risks of liver transplantation or ineffective treatment in severely affected patients. This may be of interest beyond the UK.",

The enzymatic defect results in elevated concentrations of glutaric acid, 3-hydroxyglutaric acid, glutaconic acid, and glutaryl carnitine in body tissues, which can be reliably detected by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (organic acids) and tandem mass spectrometry (acylcarnitines). Most untreated individuals with GA-I experience acute encephalopathic crises during the first 6 years of life that are triggered by infectious diseases, febrile reaction to vaccinations, and surgery. These crises result in striatal injury and consequent dystonic movement disorder; thus, significant mortality and morbidity results. In some patients, neurologic disease may also develop without clinically apparent crises at any age. Neonatal screening for GA-I us being used in a growing number of countries worldwide and is cost effective. Metabolic treatment, consisting of low lysine diet, carnitine supplementation, and intensified emergency treatment during catabolism, is effective treatment and improves neurologic outcome in those individuals diagnosed early; treatment after symptom onset, however, is less effective. Dietary treatment is relaxed after age 6\u00a0years and should be supervised by specialized metabolic centers.

As part of the development of a health system-wide integrated pharmacogenomics program, in early 2015 Northshore University Health-System established a pharmacogenomics clinic run by a multidisciplinary team including a medical geneticist, a pharmacist, a nurse practitioner, and genetic counselors. The team identified five key program elements: (1) a billable-service provider, (2) a process for documentation of relevant medication and family histories, (3) personnel with the knowledge required to interpret pharmacogenomic results, (4) personnel to discuss risks, benefits, and limitations of pharmacogenomic testing, and (5) a mechanism for reporting results. The most important program component is expert interpretation of genetic test results to provide clinically useful information; pharmacists are well positioned to provide that expertise. At the Northshore University HealthSystem pharmacogenomics clinic, patient encounters typically entail two one-hour visits and follow a standardized workflow. At the first visit, pharmacogenomics-focused medication and family histories are obtained, risks and benefits of genetic testing are explained, and a test sample is collected; at the second visit, test results are provided along with evidence-based pharmacotherapy recommendations.\nCONCLUSION: A multidisciplinary clinic providing genotyping and related services can facilitate the integration of pharmacogenomics into clinical care and meet the needs of early adopters of precision medicine.",

Pharmacogenomics education is integrated into various pharmacy school courses and, increasingly, into Pharm.D. curricula in the form of required standalone courses. Continuing-education programs and a limited number of postgraduate training opportunities are available to practicing pharmacists. For colleges and schools of pharmacy, identifying the optimal structure and content of pharmacogenomics education remains a challenge; insufficient numbers of faculty members with pharmacogenomics expertise and the inadequate availability of practice settings for experiential education are other limiting factors. Strategies for overcoming those challenges include providing early exposure to pharmacogenomics through foundational courses and incorporating pharmacogenomics into practice-based therapeutics courses and introductory and advanced pharmacy practice experiences. For practitioner education, online resources, clinical decision support-based tools, and certificate programs can be used to supplement structured postgraduate training in pharmacogenomics. Recently published data indicate successful use of \"shared curricula\" and participatory education models involving opportunities for learners to undergo personal genomic testing.\nCONCLUSION: The pharmacy profession has taken a leadership role in expanding student and practitioner education to meet the demand for increased pharmacist involvement in precision medicine initiatives.

Diagnostic cutoff levels enabling identification of newborns with milder and reversible T and/or B cell lymphopenia were also evaluated. Sixty-four children were recalled for follow-up due to low TREC and/or KREC levels, and three patients with immunodeficiency (Artemis-SCID, ATM, and an as yet unclassified T cell lymphopenia/hypogammaglobulinemia) were identified.

Participants included 17 OJ thought leaders in a large metropolitan area in the northeastern United States.\nRESULTS: Four themes emerged that describe the key components of the views of OJ thought leaders regarding genetic counseling and testing for BRCA mutation carriers. There was a high level of concern about cancer, recognition that community norms shift, acknowledgment of the role of the rabbi in medical decision making, and concern about the balance between determinism and personal responsibility in utilizing this health care service.\nCONCLUSION: The identification of social contributors to the utilization of genetic counseling and testing, as well as identification of solutions to optimize utilization of BRCA testing, supports the philosophic premise or conceptual model that faith-based leaders are crucial to the promotion of culturally sensitive health care delivery.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Pharmacogenomic-guided dosing has the potential to improve patient outcomes but its implementation has been met with clinical challenges. Our objective was to develop and evaluate a clinical decision support system (CDSS) for pharmacogenomic-guided warfarin dosing designed for physicians and pharmacists.\nMETHODS: Twelve physicians and pharmacists completed 6 prescribing tasks using simulated patient scenarios in two iterations (development and validation phases) of a newly developed pharmacogenomic-driven CDSS prototype. For each scenario, usability was measured via efficiency, recorded as time to task completion, and participants' perceived satisfaction which were compared using Kruskal-Wallis and Mann Whitney U tests, respectively. Debrief interviews were conducted and qualitatively analyzed. Usability findings from the first (i.e. development) iteration were incorporated into the CDSS design for the second (i.e. validation) iteration.\nRESULTS: During the CDSS validation iteration, participants took more time to complete tasks with a median (IQR) of 183 (124-247) seconds versus 101 (73.5-197) seconds in the development iteration (p=0.01). This increase in time on task was due to the increase in time spent in the CDSS corresponding to several design changes. Efficiency differences that were observed between pharmacists and physicians in the development iteration were eliminated in the validation iteration. The increased use of the CDSS corresponded to a greater acceptance of CDSS recommended doses in the validation iteration (4% in the first iteration vs. 37.5% in the second iteration, p<0.001). Overall satisfaction did not change statistically between the iterations but the qualitative analysis revealed greater trust in the second prototype.\nCONCLUSIONS: A pharmacogenomic-guided CDSS has been developed using warfarin as the test drug. The final CDSS prototype was trusted by prescribers and significantly increased the time using the tool and acceptance of the recommended doses. This study is an important step toward incorporating pharmacogenomics into CDSS design for clinical testing.",

Awareness of FH is poor and only 10-15% of the affected population is identified. Electronic health records provide an opportunity to increase detection and awareness in general practice OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a simple electronic extraction tool can increase detection of FH in general practice.\nMETHOD: An extraction tool applied to general practice electronic health records (EHR) to screen for FH, total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) levels in association with entered diagnostic criteria and demographic data in five general practices.\nRESULTS: Of 157,290 active patients examined, 0.7% (n=1081) had an LDL-c>5.0 mmol/L representing 1 in 146 of active patients. An additional 0.8% (n=1276) patients were at possible risk of FH. Of those with an LDL-c>5.0 mmol/L 43.7% of patients had no record of being prescribed statins. Twenty patients (0.013%) had a clinical diagnosis of FH entered in the EHR.\nCONCLUSIONS: Patients at high risk of FH can be identified by a simple electronic screening method in general practice. Clinical data entry is variable in general practice. Targeted screening enables clinical assessment of patients at risk of cardiovascular disease and using the DLCNS will enable primary care to increase identification of FH. Approximately one in five patients extracted using this method, are likely to have phenotypically probable FH, making it a useful screening tool.",

        "abstract": "Worldwide, the sustainability of public health systems is challenged by the increasing number and cost of personalized therapies. Quality biological samples stored in biobanks are essential for the provision of appropriate health services and also act as a reservoir for the development of precision medicine and biotechnological innovation. Economic sustainability is a crucial factor in the maintenance of biobanking activities. Traditionally, management of biobanking is performed by health researchers and/or clinicians whose knowledge of economic issues is inadequate. On the other hand, familiarity with financial instruments used by economists is not often accompanied by a consolidated understanding of biobanking features. This article aims to be a guide for the implementation of business plans in biobanking and proposes models for the facilitation of their preparation, thus contributing to recognition of the importance of efficient management of resources of public health services.",

        "abstract": "As Australia's peak high-performance sport agency, the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) has developed this position statement to address the implications of recent advances in the field of genetics and the ramifications for the health and well-being of athletes. Genetic testing has proven of value in the practice of clinical medicine. There are, however, currently no scientific grounds for the use of genetic testing for athletic performance improvement, sport selection or talent identification. Athletes and coaches should be discouraged from using direct-to-consumer genetic testing because of its lack of validation and replicability and the lack of involvement of a medical practitioner in the process. The transfer of genetic material or genetic modification of cells for performance enhancement is gene doping and should not be used on athletes. There are, however, valid roles for genetic research and the AIS supports genetic research which aims to enhance understanding of athlete susceptibility to injury or illness. Genetic research is only to be conducted after careful consideration of a range of ethical concerns which include the provision of adequate informed consent. The AIS is committed to providing leadership in delivering an ethical framework that protects the well-being of athletes and the integrity of sport, in the rapidly changing world of genomic science.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Informed consent is an essential component of medical practice, and especially so in procedural based specialties which entail varying degrees of risk. Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers in women, and as such is the focus of extensive research and significant media attention. Despite this, considerable misperception exists regarding the risk of developing breast cancer.\nAIMS: This study aims to examine the accuracy of risk perception of women attending a breast cancer family history clinic, and to explore the relationship between risk perception accuracy and health literacy.\nMETHODS: A cross-sectional study of women attending a breast cancer family history clinic (n\u00a0=\u00a086) was carried out, consisting of a patient survey and a validated health literacy assessment. Patients' perception of personal and population breast cancer risk was compared to actual risk as calculated by a validated risk assessment tool.\nRESULTS: Significant discordance between real and perceived risks was observed. The majority (83.7%) of women overestimated their personal lifetime risk of developing breast cancer, as well as that of other women of the same age (89.5%). Health literacy was considered potentially inadequate in 37.2% of patients; there was a correlation between low health literacy and increased risk perception inaccuracy across both personal ten-year (r<sub>s</sub>\u00a0=\u00a00.224, p\u00a0=\u00a00.039) and general ten-year population estimations. (r<sub>s</sub>\u00a0=\u00a00.267, p\u00a0=\u00a00.013).\nCONCLUSION: Inaccuracy in risk perception is highly prevalent in women attending a breast cancer family history clinic. Health literacy inadequacy is significantly associated with this inaccuracy.",

        "abstract": "DNA sequencing advances through next-generation sequencing (NGS) and several practice changing events, have led to shifting paradigms for inherited cancer predisposition testing. These changes necessitated a means by which to maximize health benefits without unnecessarily inflating healthcare costs and exacerbating health disparities. Areas covered: NGS-based tests encompass multi-gene panel tests, whole exome sequencing, and whole genome sequencing, all of which test for multiple genes simultaneously, compared to prior sequencing practices through which testing was performed sequentially for one or two genes. Taking an ecological approach, this article synthesizes the current literature to consider the broad impact of these advances from the individual patient-, interpersonal-, organizational-, community- and policy-levels. Furthermore, the authors describe how multi-level factors that impact genetic testing and follow-up care reveal great potential to widen existing health disparities if these issues are not addressed. Expert commentary: As we consider ways to maximize patient benefit from testing in a cost effective manner, it is important to consider perspectives from multiple levels. This information is needed to guide the development of interventions such that the promise of genomic testing may be realized by all populations, regardless of race, ethnicity and ability to pay.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Individuals routinely receive information about their risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) based on traditional risk factors as part of their primary care. We are also able to calculate individual's risk of CHD based on their genetic information and at present genetic testing for common diseases is available to the public. Due to the limitations in previous studies further understanding is needed about the impact of the risk information on individual's well-being and health-behaviour. We aimed to explore the short term response to receiving different forms of CHD risk information and lifestyle advice for risk reduction.\nMETHODS: We conducted fourty-one face-to-face interviews and two focus groups across England with participants from the INFORM trial who received a combination of individualised phenotypic and genotypic CHD risk scores and web-based lifestyle advice. Risk scores were presented in different formats, e.g. absolute 10\u00a0year risk was presented as a thermometer and expressed as a percentage, natural frequency and 'heart age'. Interviews and focus groups explored participants' understanding and reaction to the risk scores and attempts to change lifestyle during the intervention. We tape-recorded and transcribed the interviews and focus groups and analysed them using thematic analysis.\nRESULTS: Three main themes were identified: limitations of risk scores to generate concern about CHD risk; the advantages of the 'heart age' format of risk score presentation in communicating a message of sub-optimal lifestyle; and intentions and attempts to make moderate lifestyle changes which were prompted by the web-based lifestyle advice.\nCONCLUSIONS: There are a number of limitations to the use of risk scores to communicate a message about the need for a lifestyle change. Of the formats used, the 'heart age', if noticed, appears to convey the most powerful message about how far from optimal risk an individual person is. An interactive, user friendly, goal setting based lifestyle website can act as a trigger to initiate moderate lifestyle changes, regardless of concerns about risk scores.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN17721237 .

Patients aged 40 to 54 years were identified by means of the practice software and interviewed by health care assistants using a standardized four-item questionnaire. Outcome was occurrence of a positive family history of CRC, defined as at least one first-degree relative (FDR: parents, siblings, or children) with CRC.

        "abstract": "New Zealand has undertaken expanded newborn screening since 2006. During that period there have been no reported cases of fatty acid oxidation disorders or organic acidemias that have been diagnosed clinically that the screening programme missed. However there may have been patients that presented clinically that were not diagnosed correctly or notified.In order to investigate the false-negative screening rate a case-control study was undertaken whereby the clinical coding data and relevant medical records were reviewed for 150 controls and 525 cases. The cases had normal newborn screening but with key analytes and/or ratios just below the notification level for individual disorders and thus in theory were most at risk of having metabolic disease.Two cases had medical histories suggestive of metabolic disease and thus could represent a false-negative screen. One of these had marginally elevated octanoyl carnitine levels and thus possible medium-chain acyl Co-A dehydrogenase deficiency (MCADD) while the other had elevated isovaleryl carnitine and thus may have been a case of isovaleric acidemia (IVA). However, subsequent molecular analysis revealed that the diagnosis of MCADD and IVA was unlikely.Despite relatively high cut-offs the New Zealand Newborn Metabolic Screening Programme does not appear to have missed any confirmed cases of fatty acid oxidation disorders and organic acidemias in its first 8 years of expanded newborn screening. This would suggest a similar low false-negative screening rate in centres with comparable screening protocols and would indicate that the risk of fatty acid oxidation disorders and classical organic acidemias in children who had normal newborn screening is low.",

        "abstract": "Here we present a case of an asymptomatic 53-year-old woman who sought genetic testing for Familial Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (fCJD) after learning that her mother had fCJD. The patient's mother had a sudden onset of memory problems and rapidly deteriorating mental faculties in her late 70s, which led to difficulties ambulating, progressive non-fluent aphasia, dysphagia and death within \u223c1\u00a0y of symptom onset. The cause of death was reported as \"rapid onset dementia.\" The patient's family, unhappy with the vague diagnosis, researched prion disorders online and aggressively pursued causation and submitted frozen brain tissue from the mother to the National Prion Disease Surveillance Center, where testing revealed a previously described 5-octapeptide repeat insertion (5-OPRI) in the prion protein gene (PRNP) that is known to cause fCJD. The family had additional questions about the implications of this result and thus independently sought out genetic counseling. \u2003While rare, fCJD is likely underdiagnosed due to clinical heterogeneity, rapid onset, early non-specific symptomatology, and overlap in the differential diagnosis of Alzheimer disease and Lewy body dementias. When fCJD is identified, a multidisciplinary approach to return of results that includes the affected patient's provider, genetics professionals, and mental health professionals is key to the care of the family. We present an example case which discusses the psychosocial issues encountered and the role of genetic counseling in presymptomatic testing for incurable neurodegenerative conditions.

Fortunately, the breast and ovarian cancer outcome for BRCA1/2 mutation carriers is at least as good as for non-carriers with chemoprevention, prophylactic surgeries and appropriate use of therapies. Therefore, identification of those who might have a mutation is important so that genetic counseling, testing, screening and prevention strategies can be applied in a timely manner. This article reviews the impact of genetic testing in general, timing of genetic testing after diagnosis and prior knowledge of mutation status in BRCA carriers with newly diagnosed breast cancer.

However, little is known about customers' behaviors after PGT. Methods Longitudinal surveys were given to new customers of 23andMe (Mountain View, CA) and Pathway Genomics (San Diego, CA). Survey data were linked to individual-level PGT results through a secure data transfer process. Results Of the 1,042 customers who completed baseline and 6-month surveys (response rate, 71.2%), 762 had complete cancer-related data and were analyzed. Most customers reported that learning about their genetic risk of cancers was a motivation for testing (colorectal, 88%; prostate, 95%; breast, 94%). No customers tested positive for pathogenic mutations in highly penetrant cancer susceptibility genes. A minority of individuals received elevated single nucleotide polymorphism-based PGT cancer risk estimates (colorectal, 24%; prostate, 24%; breast, 12%). At 6 months, customers who received elevated PGT cancer risk estimates were not significantly more likely to change their diet, exercise, or advanced planning behaviors or engage in cancer screening, compared with individuals at average or reduced risk. Men who received elevated PGT prostate cancer risk estimates changed their vitamin and supplement use more than those at average or reduced risk (22% v 7.6%, respectively; adjusted odds ratio, 3.41; 95% CI, 1.44 to 8.18). Predictors of 6-month behavior include baseline behavior (exercise, vitamin or supplement use, and screening), worse health status (diet and vitamin or supplement use), and older age (advanced planning, screening). Conclusion Most adults receiving elevated direct-to-consumer PGT single nucleotide polymorphism-based cancer risk estimates did not significantly change their diet, exercise, advanced care planning, or cancer screening behaviors.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Effective, narcotic sparing analgesia is a major component of Enhanced Recovery Protocols (ERP), however the risk of poor analgesia and opioid related side effects (ORADE) remains an issue related to poor outcomes and satisfaction, and is strongly related to the risk of narcotic dependence after surgery. A variety of genes can impact narcotic and non-steroidal (NSAID) drug efficacy including: the CYP family (drug metabolism-narcotics and NSAID), or COMT/ABCB1/OPRM1 (functional receptor and transport activity for analgesia vs side effects). The purpose of this study was to perform the first assessment of the impact of a pharmacogenetics (PGx) guided selection of analgesics following major abdominal surgery within an ERP.\nMETHODS: A consecutive series of open and laparoscopic colorectal resections or major ventral hernia repair (PGx group) had a guided analgesic protocol based upon assessment of CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, COMT, OPRM1, and ABCB1 genes. Study patients were compared to a recent historical series of patients (H group) managed using our well validated ERP. The primary outcome measure was the Overall Benefit of Analgesia Score (OBAS). Pain scores were also assessed.\nRESULTS: The data demonstrated a similar mix of procedures and gender between groups and more than half of the PGx group had revised analgesia from the standard ERP. The PGx group demonstrated significantly lower OBAS scores (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0.1) from POD1 (3.8 vs 5.4) through POD 5 (3.0 vs 4.5) Analgesia was also superior for the PGx group from POD1 through POD 5 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.04).\nCONCLUSION: Pharmacogenetics guidance resulted in frequent modifications of the analgesic program, resulting in excellent analgesia with a 50% reduction in narcotic consumption, and a reduced incidence of analgesic related side effects compared to our standard ERP. These data suggest further improvement in ERP resulting from a patient centric analgesic, reduced narcotic regimen which provides early and durable pain control with fewer narcotic related side effects.",

Despite United States (U.S.) guidelines, less than half of eligible women receive testing. Reasons for low usage are unclear: Our objective was to better understand U.S. oncologists' ODX uptake and how they use ODX during adjuvant chemotherapy decision making.\nMETHODS: We conducted semi-structured, ~30-minute phone interviews with medical and surgical oncologists in one U.S. State using purposive sampling. Oncologists were included if they saw greater than or equal to five breast cancer patients per week. Recruitment ended upon thematic saturation. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and double-coded using template analysis.\nRESULTS: During analysis, themes emerged across three domains. First, organizational factors (i.e., departmental structure, ODX marketing, and medical/insurance guidelines) influenced ease of ODX use. Second, oncologists referenced the influence of interpersonal factors (e.g., normative beliefs and peer use of ODX) over their own practices and recommendations. Third, intrapersonal factors (e.g., oncologist attitudes, perceived barriers, and research gaps) were discussed: although oncologists largely held positive attitudes about ODX, they reported challenges with interpreting intermediate scores for treatment decisions and explaining test results to patients. Finally, oncologists identified several research gaps.\nCONCLUSIONS: As more tumor gene profiling tests are incorporated into cancer care for treatment decision making, it is important to understand their use in clinical practice. This study identified multi-level factors that influence ODX uptake into clinical practice, providing insights into facilitators and modifiable barriers that can be leveraged for improving ODX uptake to aid treatment decision making.",

Mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency was determined by microsatellite instability and/or immunohistochemistry. Germline DNA was tested for mutations in 25 cancer susceptibility genes using next-generation sequencing.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Mutation prevalence and spectrum in patients with early-onset CRC was determined. Clinical characteristics were assessed by mutation status.\nRESULTS: In total 450 patients younger than 50 years were included in the study, and 75 gene mutations were found in 72 patients (16%). Forty-eight patients (10.7%) had MMR-deficient tumors, and 40 patients (83.3%) had at least 1 gene mutation: 37 had Lynch syndrome (13, MLH1 [including one with constitutional MLH1 methylation]; 16, MSH2; 1, MSH2/monoallelic MUTYH; 2, MSH6; 5, PMS2); 1 patient had the APC c.3920T>A, p.I1307K mutation and a PMS2 variant; 9 patients (18.8%) had double somatic MMR mutations (including 2 with germline biallelic MUTYH mutations); and 1 patient had somatic MLH1 methylation. Four hundred two patients (89.3%) had MMR-proficient tumors, and 32 patients (8%) had at least 1 gene mutation: 9 had mutations in high-penetrance CRC genes (5, APC; 1, APC/PMS2; 2, biallelic MUTYH; 1, SMAD4); 13 patients had mutations in high- or moderate-penetrance genes not traditionally associated with CRC (3, ATM; 1, ATM/CHEK2; 2, BRCA1; 4, BRCA2; 1, CDKN2A; 2, PALB2); 10 patients had mutations in low-penetrance CRC genes (3, APC c.3920T>A, p.I1307K; 7, monoallelic MUTYH). Importantly, 24 of 72 patients (33.3%) who were mutation positive did not meet established genetic testing criteria for the gene(s) in which they had a mutation.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Of 450 patients with early-onset CRC, 72 (16%) had gene mutations. Given the high frequency and wide spectrum of mutations, genetic counseling and testing with a multigene panel could be considered for all patients with early-onset CRC.",

        "abstract": "Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) is a common (early estimates suggested a prevalence of 1 in 500 individuals, but recent studies have indicated that it may be higher) genetic disorder characterized by markedly elevated plasma concentrations of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). HeFH is associated with an elevated risk of premature coronary heart disease, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease. Despite the availability of reliable diagnostic criteria (high LDL-C levels, family history or premature CHD and hypercholesterolemia, cerebral/peripheral vascular disease, and the presence of tendon xanthomata or presence of arcus cornealis before age of 45), HeFH is underdiagnosed and undertreated worldwide. Moreover, while there are effective treatments available to decrease LDL-C and prevent early-onset heart disease in individuals with HeFH, because of the high baseline levels of LDL-C, the achievement of target LDL-C levels remains a challenge. In recent years, a number of novel therapies to lower LDL-C levels in HeFH have been developed, including the monoclonal antibodies against serine protease proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), alirocumab and evolocumab, which have the potential to reduce LDL-C by an additional 50%-60% when prescribed in combination with standard lipid-lowering drugs.

Some of these guidelines are almost entirely evidence-based whereas others are a mix of evidence and expert opinion. Guidelines differ on such simple questions as to whether blood samples should be fasting or nonfasting, and whether low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) or another lipid parameter should be the primary focus of treatment. Different risk assessment tools are recommended by different guidelines. Lifetime risk is highlighted in some guidelines, with the suggestion that earlier treatment will reduce lifetime risk in younger people even when short-term risk is low. Some guidelines have numerical treatment targets that differ according to level of risk, while others eschew targets but recommend statins at high or moderate intensity to reduce LDL-C by \u2265 50% or 30%-50%, respectively. Statins are the backbone of therapy in all guidelines. Ezetimibe produced a 6.4% relative risk reduction in the only large clinical outcomes trial in which it was tested, and is recommended for high-risk patients with an inadequate response to statins, despite the high number needed to treat to prevent 1 CV event. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 inhibitors lack outcome data to support their use, but are approved for patients with familial hypercholesterolemia or clinical atherosclerotic CV disease who require additional LDL-C lowering beyond statins.

The authors developed the Proactive Molecular Risk Classifier for Endometrial Cancer (ProMisE), a molecular classification system based on The Cancer Genome Atlas genomic subgroups, and sought to confirm both feasibility and prognostic ability in a new, large cohort of ECs.\nMETHODS: Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for the presence or absence of mismatch repair (MMR) proteins (to identify MMR deficiency [MMR-D]), sequencing for polymerase-\u025b (POLE) exonuclease domain mutations (POLE EDMs), and IHC for tumor protein 53 (p53) (wild type vs null/missense mutations; p53 wt and p53 abn, respectively) were performed on 319 new EC samples. Subgroups were characterized and assessed relative to outcomes. The prognostic ability of ProMisE was compared with that of current risk-stratification systems (European Society of Medical Oncology [ESMO]).\nRESULTS: ProMisE decision-tree classification achieved categorization of all cases and identified 4 prognostic subgroups with distinct overall, disease-specific, and progression-free survival (P\u2009<\u2009.001). Tumors with POLE EDMs had the most favorable prognosis, and those with p53 abn the worst prognosis, and separation of the 2 middle survival curves (p53 wt and MMR-D) was observed. There were no significant differences in survival between the ESMO low-risk and intermediate-risk groups. ProMisE improved the ability to discriminate outcomes compared with ESMO risk stratification. There was substantial overlap (89%) between the p53 abn and high-risk ESMO subgroups; but, otherwise, there were no predictable associations between molecular and ESMO risk groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: Molecular classification of ECs can be achieved using clinically applicable methods and provides independent prognostic information beyond established clinicopathologic risk factors available at diagnosis. Consistent, biologically relevant categorization enables stratification for clinical trials and/or targeted therapy, identification of women who are at increased risk of having Lynch syndrome, and may guide clinical management.

        "abstract": "Family health history collection and genetic testing are core elements for the successful translation of genomics into primary care practice. Yet, little is known about how pediatric providers implement these elements in practice. We surveyed the membership of the American Academy of Pediatrics regarding family health history (FHH) collection and genetic testing in the primary care setting. Three hundred forty-nine (349) responses were analyzed with the initial response rate of 43.3%. Four principal findings were noted-(1) family health history is still recognized as a critical part of the medical evaluation; (2) perceived obstacles for FHH are time in obtaining the FHH and concerns about the family's knowledge of their FHH; (3) a 3-generation family history is out of the scope of routine care and alternate methods should be considered; (4) most primary care providers (PCPs) do not feel comfortable ordering, interpreting, and counseling regarding current genetic testing. Expanded genetic/genomic education at multiple levels (undergraduate medical education, graduate medical education, and maintenance of certification) is clearly indicated to allow PCPs to integrate these vital elements into a current evaluation (acute care or health maintenance) in the primary care setting.",

        "title": "Nine years of newborn screening for classical galactosemia in the Netherlands: Effectiveness of screening methods, and identification of patients with previously unreported phenotypes.",
        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Newborn screening (NBS) for classical galactosemia (CG) was introduced in the Netherlands in 2007. Multiple screening methods have been used since, and currently a two-tier system is used, with residual enzyme activity of galactose-1-phosphate-uridyltransferase (GALT) and total galactose concentration in dried blood spots as the primary and secondary markers. As it is essential to monitor effectiveness of NBS programs, we assessed the effectiveness of different screening methods used over time (primary aim), and aimed to identify and investigate patients identified through NBS with previously unreported clinical and biochemical phenotypes (secondary aim).\nMETHODS: The effectiveness of different screening methods and their cut-off values (COVs), as used from 2007 through 2015, was determined, and the clinical and biochemical data of all identified patients were retrospectively collected.\nRESULTS: All screening methods and COVs resulted in relatively high false-positive rates and low positive predictive values. Total galactose levels in dried blood spots were far above the COV for NBS in all true positive cases. A total of 31 galactosemia patients were identified, and when corrected for a family with three affected siblings, 14% had a previously unreported phenotype and genotype. These individuals did not demonstrate any symptoms at the time of diagnosis while still being exposed to galactose, had galactose-1-phosphate values below detection limit within months after the start of diet, and had previously unreported genotypes.\nCONCLUSION: Optimization of NBS for CG in the Netherlands is warranted because of the high false-positive rate, which may result in significant harm. Furthermore, a surprising 14% of newborns identified with CG by screening had previously unreported clinical and biochemical phenotypes and genotypes. For them, individualized prognostication and treatment are warranted, in order to avoid unnecessary stringent galactose restriction.",

        "abstract": "STUDY QUESTION: To what extent are BRCA mutation carriers and their partners in the Netherlands aware about preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) and prenatal diagnosis (PND) as reproductive options and what is their attitude towards these options?\nSUMMARY ANSWER: Awareness of PGD (66%) and PND (61%) among BRCA mutation carriers and their partners is relatively high and 80% and 26%, respectively, of BRCA carriers and their partners find offering PGD and PND for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) acceptable.\nWHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Internationally, awareness of PGD among persons with a genetic cancer predisposition appears to be relatively low (35%) and although acceptability is generally high (71%), only a small proportion of mutation carriers would consider using PGD (36%). However, for HBOC, there are no studies available that investigated the perspective of individuals with a confirmed BRCA1/2 mutation and their partners about PGD and PND including demographic and medical correlates of awareness and acceptability.\nSTUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: A cross-sectional survey was completed by 191 participants between July 2012 and June 2013. Participants were recruited through patient organizations (88%) and the databases of two Clinical Genetics departments in the Netherlands (12%).\nPARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Male and female BRCA carriers and their partners completed an online survey, which assessed demographic and medical characteristics, and awareness, knowledge, acceptability and consideration of PGD and PND as main outcomes. Correlations between demographic and medical characteristics and the main outcomes were investigated.\nMAIN RESULTS AND ROLE OF CHANCE: The majority of respondents were female (87%), of reproductive age (86%) and about half reported a desire for a child in the future. About two-thirds (66%) were aware of PGD and 61% of PND for HBOC. PGD knowledge was moderate (5.5 on a 9-point scale) and acceptability of PGD and PND for HBOC was 80% and 26%, respectively. A minority would personally consider using PGD (39%) or PND (20%). Individuals with a higher educational level were more likely to be aware of PGD (P < 0.001) and PND (P < 0.001) and persons with a more immediate child wish were more often aware of PGD (P = 0.044) and had more knowledge about PGD (P = 0.001). PGD acceptability was positively associated with knowledge about PGD (P = 0.047), and PND acceptability was higher among partners in comparison to carriers (P = 0.001). Participants with a history of cancer and with a higher perceived seriousness of breast and ovarian cancer were more likely to consider using PGD (P = 0.003 and P < 0.001 respectively) or PND (P = 0.021 and P = 0.017 respectively).\nLIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The response rate (23%) of participants invited by the clinical genetics departments was low, probably related to a simultaneous study that used a similar recruitment strategy within the same target group, which may have resulted in selection bias. Moreover, PGD knowledge was measured with an instrument that is not yet validated since to date such an instrument is not available in the literature. Finally, the cross-sectional design of this study limits us from drawing any causal conclusions.\nWIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Improvement of information provision remains needed, in order to timely inform all couples with HBOC about the available reproductive options and enable them to make a balanced reproductive decision. This may limit the risk of negative psychological impact due to decisional conflict and possible regret.\nSTUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S): The Dutch breast cancer foundation Stichting Pink Ribbon (grant number 2010.PS11.C74).

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: We investigated the use of genome sequencing for preconception carrier testing. Genome sequencing could identify one or more of thousands of X-linked or autosomal recessive conditions that could be disclosed during preconception or prenatal counseling. Therefore, a framework that helps both clinicians and patients understand the possible range of findings is needed to respect patient preferences by ensuring that information about only the desired types of genetic conditions are provided to a given patient.\nMETHODS: We categorized gene-condition pairs into groups using a previously developed taxonomy of genetic conditions. Patients could elect to receive results from these categories. A Return of Results Committee (RORC) developed inclusion and exclusion criteria for each category.\nRESULTS: To date, the RORC has categorized 728 gene-condition pairs: 177 are categorized as life span-limiting, 406 are categorized as serious, 93 are categorized as mild, 41 are categorized as unpredictable, and 11 are categorized as adult-onset. An additional 64 gene-condition pairs were excluded from reporting to patients or put on a watch list, generally because evidence that a gene and condition were associated was limited.\nCONCLUSION: Categorization of gene-condition pairs using our taxonomy simplifies communication regarding patient preferences for carrier information from a genomic test.Genet Med advance online publication 12 January 2017.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Across cancers, the decision to pursue genetic testing is influenced more by subjective than objective factors. However, skin cancer, which is more prevalent, visual, and multifactorial than many other malignancies, may offer different motivations for pursuing such testing.\nOBJECTIVES: The primary objective was to determine factors influencing the decision to receive genetic testing for skin cancer risk. A secondary objective was to assess the impact of priming with health questions on the decision to receive testing.\nMETHODS: We distributed anonymous online surveys through ResearchMatch.org to assess participant health, demographics, motivations, and interest in pursuing genetic testing for skin cancer risk. Two surveys with identical questions but different question ordering were used to assess the secondary objective.\nRESULTS: We received 3783 responses (64% response rate), and 85.8% desired testing. Subjective factors, including curiosity, perceptions of skin cancer, and anxiety, were the most statistically significant determinants of the decision to pursue testing (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001), followed by history of sun exposure (odds ratio 1.85, P\u00a0<\u00a0.01) and history of skin cancer (odds ratio 0.5, P\u00a0=\u00a0.01). Age and family history of skin cancer did not influence this decision. Participants increasingly chose testing if first queried about health behaviors (P\u00a0<\u00a0.0001).\nLIMITATIONS: The decision to pursue hypothetical testing may differ from in-clinic decision-making. Self-selected, online participants may differ from the general population. Surveys may be subject to response bias.\nCONCLUSION: The decision to pursue genetic testing for skin cancer is primarily determined by subjective factors, such as anxiety and curiosity. Health factors, including skin cancer history, also influenced decision-making. Priming with consideration of objective health factors can increase the desire to pursue testing.",

In some patients, causative genetic mutations are detected that facilitate patient treatment and follow-up. The feasibility of next-generation sequencing (NGS) has increased with its greater availability and decreasing costs.\nOBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the diagnostic yield of NGS in patients with IVF.\nMETHODS: A total of 33 patients initially diagnosed with IVF were included (mean age 53 \u00b1 15 years; 14(42%) men). In all included patients, NGS of 33 genes and the DPP6 haplotype revealed no pathogenic mutations. Genetic screening comprised NGS of a panel of 179 additional genes. Variants with a minor allele frequency of <0.05% were assessed for pathogenicity by using existing mutation databases and in silico predictive algorithms.\nRESULTS: In 1 of 33 patients, a likely pathogenic mutation was detected. The added yield of genetic testing with NGS of 179 additional genes is 3% in patients with IVF. In 15% of patients, 1 or multiple variants of uncertain clinical significance were detected.\nCONCLUSION: The added yield of genetic screening of extended NGS panels in patients initially diagnosed with IVF is minimal. Routine analysis of large diagnostic NGS panels is therefore not recommended.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Genomic testing improves outcomes for many at-risk individuals and patients with cancer; however, little is known about how genomic testing for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and colorectal cancer (CRC) is used in clinical practice.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: In 2012 to 2013, we surveyed medical oncologists who care for patients in diverse practice and health care settings across the United States about their use of guideline- and non-guideline-endorsed genetic tests. Multivariable regression models identified factors that are associated with greater test use.\nRESULTS: Of oncologists, 337 completed the survey (participation rate, 53%). Oncologists reported higher use of guideline-endorsed tests (eg, KRAS for CRC; EGFR for NSCLC) than non-guideline-endorsed tests (eg, Onco typeDX Colon; ERCC1 for NSCLC). Many oncologists reported having no patients with CRC who had mismatch repair and/or microsatellite instability (24%) or germline Lynch syndrome (32%) testing, and no patients with NSCLC who had ALK testing (11%). Of oncologists, 32% reported that five or fewer patients had KRAS and EGFR testing for CRC and NSCLC, respectively. Oncologists, rather than pathologists or surgeons, ordered the vast majority of tests. In multivariable analyses, fewer patients in nonprofit integrated health care delivery systems underwent testing than did patients in hospital or office-based single-specialty group settings (all P < .05). High patient volume and patient requests (CRC only) were also associated with higher test use (all P < .05).\nCONCLUSION: Genomic test use for CRC and NSCLC varies by test and practice characteristics. Research in specific clinical contexts is needed to determine whether the observed variation reflects appropriate or inappropriate care. One potential way to reduce unwanted variation would be to offer widespread reflexive testing by pathology for guideline-endorsed predictive somatic tests.",

In order to contribute to the improvement of the diagnosis, treatment and care of patients, Orphanet (www.orpha.net) has set up a procedure for the selection, quality evaluation and dissemination of CPGs, with the aim to provide easy access to relevant, accurate and specific recommendations for the management of RDs. This article provides an analysis of selected CPGs by medical domain coverage, prevalence of diseases, languages and type of producer, and addresses the variability in CPG quality and availability. CPGs are identified via bibliographic databases, websites of research networks, expert centres or medical societies. They are assessed according to quality criteria derived from the Appraisal of Guidelines, REsearch and Evaluation (AGREE II) Instrument. Only open access CPGs and documents for which permission from the copyright holders has been obtained are disseminated on the Orphanet website. From January 2012 to July 2015, 277 CPGs were disseminated, representing coverage of 1,122 groups of diseases, diseases or subtypes in the Orphanet database. No language restriction is applied, and so far 10 languages are represented, with a predominance of CPGs in English, French and German (92% of all CPGs). A large proportion of diseases with identified CPGs belong to rare oncologic, neurologic, hematologic diseases or developmental anomalies. The Orphanet project on CPG collection, evaluation and dissemination is a continuous process, with regular addition of new guidelines, and updates.

Patients were mailed questionnaires. Baseline FH and screening data were obtained for enrolled patients from the EMR and health questionnaires.\nSETTING: Ontario and Alberta.\nPARTICIPANTS: Randomly selected patients from 8 family practices.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Agreement on FH between the EMR and questionnaire was determined; logistic regression was used to assess significant predictors of screening.\nRESULTS: In total, 775 of 789 (98%) patients completed the health questionnaire. The mean age of participants was 52.5 years and 72% were female. A minimum of 12% of patients (range 12% to 36%) had a reported FH of 1 of 4 chronic diseases. Among patients with positive FH, the following proportions of patients had that FH recorded in the EMR compared with the questionnaire: diabetes, 24% in the EMR versus 36% on the questionnaire, \u03ba = 0.466; coronary artery disease, 35% in the EMR versus 22% on the questionnaire, \u03ba = 0.225; breast cancer, 21% in the EMR versus 22% on the questionnaire, \u03ba = 0.241; and CRC, 12% in the EMR versus 14% on the questionnaire, \u03ba = 0.510. There was moderate agreement for diabetes and CRC. The presence of FH was a significant predictor of CRC screening (odds ratio 1.9, 95% CI 1.1 to 3.1).\nCONCLUSION: A moderate prevalence of FH was found for 4 conditions for which screening recommendations vary with risk based on FH. Having patients self-complete an FH was thought to be feasible; however, questions about FH accuracy and completeness from both self-report and EMR remain. Work is needed to determine how to facilitate the adoption of FH tools into practice as well as strategies linking familial risk to appropriate screening.Trial registration number ISRCTN07170460 (ISRCTN Registry).",

Using whole exome sequencing we sought to stratify a national population of children with SRNS into monogenic and non-monogenic forms, and further define those groups by detailed phenotypic analysis. Pediatric patients with SRNS were identified via a national United Kingdom Renal Registry. Whole exome sequencing was performed on 187 patients, of which 12% have a positive family history with a focus on the 53 genes currently known to be associated with nephrotic syndrome. Genetic findings were correlated with individual case disease characteristics. Disease causing variants were detected in 26.2% of patients. Most often this occurred in the three most common SRNS-associated genes: NPHS1, NPHS2, and WT1 but also in 14 other genes. The genotype did not always correlate with expected phenotype since mutations in OCRL, COL4A3, and DGKE associated with specific syndromes were detected in patients with isolated renal disease. Analysis by primary/presumed compared with secondary steroid resistance found 30.8% monogenic disease in primary compared with none in secondary SRNS permitting further mechanistic stratification. Genetic SRNS progressed faster to end stage renal failure, with no documented disease recurrence post-transplantation within this cohort. Primary steroid resistance in which no gene mutation was identified had a 47.8% risk of recurrence. In this unbiased pediatric population, whole exome sequencing allowed screening of all current candidate genes. Thus, deep phenotyping combined with whole exome sequencing is an effective tool for early identification of SRNS etiology, yielding an evidence-based algorithm for clinical management.",

This study aimed to identify different types of misorders and analyze the impact of a combined test review and consultative service on reducing misorders over time.\nMETHODS: Selected genetic tests were systematically reviewed between January and December 2015 at Stanford Health Care. Misorders were categorized into five types: clerical errors, redundant testing, better alternatives, controversial, and uncategorized. Moreover, consultations were offered to help clinicians with test selection.\nRESULTS: Of the 629 molecular test orders reviewed, 13% were classified as misorders, and 7% were modified or canceled. Controversial misorders constitute the most common type (42%); however, unlike the other misorder types, they were negligibly affected by test review. Simultaneously, 71 consults were received. With the introduction of the UM program, genetic test misorders went from 22% at baseline to 3% at the end of the year.\nCONCLUSION: Our results show that the combined approach of test review and consultative service effectively reduced misorders over time and suggest that a UM program focused on eliminating misorders can positively influence health-care providers' behaviors.Genet Med advance online publication 26 January 2017.",

The observed BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation statuses were compared with the predicted carrier probabilities using BRCAPRO and the Myriad BRCA risk calculator.\nRESULTS: Two hundred thirty-two patients were recruited, of whom 99.1% (230/232) were of Korean ethnicity. Of the 232 individuals, 206 and 26 had ovarian and double primary breast/ovarian cancer, respectively. Thirty-six individuals had a family history of breast/ovarian cancer in first-degree relatives. Fifty-seven patients (24.6%) tested positive for BRCA mutation (41 BRCA1, 16 BRCA2). The mean BRCAPRO and Myriad scores for all patients were 6.4% and 7.7%, respectively. The scores were significantly higher for patients with positive BRCA mutation status (29.0% vs. 6.1%, P<0.001, 12.1% vs. 7.7%, P<0.001, respectively). For all patients, the respective areas under the receiver operating characteristics curves were 0.720 and 0.747 for the BRCAPRO and Myriad models to predict the risk of carrying a BRCA mutation. Both models overestimated the mutation probability in patients with a family history of breast/ovarian cancer (1.55-fold and 1.50-fold, respectively) and underestimated the probability in patients without a family history (both, 0.54-fold).\nCONCLUSION: BRCAPRO and Myriad seem to be acceptable risk assessment tools for determining the risk of carrying BRCA mutations in Korean ovarian cancer patients.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Clinical genetics guidelines from 2011 conceptualise genetic information as confidential to families, not individuals. The normative consequence of this is that the family's interest is the primary consideration and genetic information is shared unless there are good reasons not to do so. We investigated healthcare professionals' (HCPs') views about, and reasoning around, individual and familial approaches to confidentiality and how such views influenced their practice.\nMETHOD: 16 focus groups with 80 HCPs working in/with clinical genetics services were analysed, drawing on grounded theory.\nRESULTS: Participants raised seven problems with, and arguments against, going beyond the individual approach to confidentiality. These problems fell into two overlapping categories: 'relationships' and 'structures'. Most participants had never considered ways to-or thought it was impossible to-treat familial genetic information and personal information differently. They worried that putting the familial approach into practice could disrupt family dynamics and erode patient trust in the health service. They also thought they had insufficient resources to share information and feared that sharing might change the standard of care and make them more vulnerable to liability.\nCONCLUSIONS: A familial approach to confidentiality has not been accepted or adopted as a standard, but wider research suggests that some of the problems HCPs perceived are surmountable and sharing in the interest of the family can be achieved. However, further research is needed to explore how personal and familial genetic information can be separated in practice. Our findings are relevant to HCPs across health services who are starting to use genome tests as part of their routine investigations.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Family history is crucial in stratifying patients' risk for colorectal cancer (CRC). Previous risk assessment tools developed for use in clinic or endoscopy settings have demonstrated suboptimal specificity for identifying patients with hereditary cancer syndromes. Our aim was to test the feasibility and performance of 2 family history surveys (paper and electronic) in individuals presenting for outpatient colonoscopy.\nMETHODS: Patients presenting for outpatient colonoscopy at a tertiary care center were asked to complete a 5-question paper risk assessment survey (short paper survey) either alone or in conjunction with a second, comprehensive electronic family risk assessment survey (comprehensive tablet survey). Each subject's survey results, along with the electronic medical record, were reviewed, and 10 high-risk criteria and PREMM1,2,6 model scores (a predictive model for carrying a Lynch syndrome-associated gene mutation) were used to identify patients warranting genetic evaluation for suspected hereditary cancer syndromes.\nRESULTS: Six hundred patients completed the short paper survey (cohort 1), with an additional 100 patients completing both the short paper and comprehensive tablet survey (cohort 2). Using 10 high-risk criteria and/or a PREMM1,2,6 score\u00a0\u22655%, we identified 10% and 9% of patients as high risk for CRC in cohorts 1 and 2, respectively. Of the 69 high-risk subjects, 23 (33%) underwent genetic evaluations and 7 (10%) carried germline mutations associated with cancer predisposition. Both patients and endoscopists reported the tools were user-friendly and helpful for CRC risk stratification.\nCONCLUSIONS: Systematic assessment of family history in colonoscopy patients is feasible and can help endoscopists identify high-risk patients who would benefit from genetic evaluation.",

        "abstract": "Whether a positive family history of breast cancer or ovarian cancer (FHBOC) would affect the prognosis of breast cancer is still up for debate and further study. This meta-analysis was performed to clarify this issue. We reviewed two databases (PubMed and CNKI) for research articles published at any time from the inception of these databases to April 1, 2016 for articles detecting the impact of FHBOC on the prognosis of breast cancer. A meta-analysis was conducted to generated combined hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for overall survival (OS) and breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS). Eighteen studies were included in our qualitative analysis, with 15 studies ultimately part of the quantitative analysis. The pooled results demonstrated that a positive FHBOC was associated with better OS (0.89, 95% CI 0.83-0.95) and BCSS (0.90, 95% CI 0.82-0.99). In subgroup analyses, several subgroups (maximally adjusted studies, population based studies, high quality studies, family history of breast cancer, studies from Europe, studies from Asia, 1 affected relative, or tumor size\u2009>\u20092\u00a0cm), a positive first-degree FHBOC was associated with better prognosis of breast cancer. Notably, for those patients who underwent breast-conserving surgery, first-degree FHBOC was not a risk factor for OS (HR 1.08, 95% CI 0.53-2.21). Our meta-analysis demonstrated that a first-degree FHBOC was associated with better OS and BCSS in patients with breast cancer. These findings support that clinical management should not differ between women with and without FHBOC.",

        "abstract": "While medical research continues to investigate the genetic basis of cancer, and personalised prevention gains momentum, little research has been conducted with the individuals who decline predictive genetic testing for cancer. We recruited individuals who had been offered genetic testing for Lynch syndrome or bi-allelic MUTYH mutations due to their participation in a large, population-based, Australia-wide colorectal cancer study. Thirty-three individuals in mutation-carrying families, unaffected by cancer, who had actively or passively declined testing at one of four decision-making points, took part in a qualitative interview about their decision. Data analysis revealed a typology of 'decliners': (1) uninformed about genetic testing; (2) a weak intention to undergo genetic testing; (3) conditionally declining; and (4) unconditionally declining testing. In this population we found substantial barriers to achieving the benefits promised by predictive genetic testing; a lack of knowledge of the availability of genetic testing; a lack of trust in genetic test information; a desire to see a stronger benefit from genetic testing before proceeding; and a sense that there may be more negative than positive outcomes from genetic testing. These discourses must be addressed if medical research on the genetic basis of cancer continues to be funded, and personalised prevention of cancer continues to be recommended by experts.",

INGenious is an implementation of a panel of genomic tests.\nMETHODS: We conducted a descriptive case study of the implementation of this pharmacogenomics program, which has a wide scope (14 genes, 27 medications) and a diverse population (patients who often have multiple chronic illnesses, in a large urban safety-net hospital and its outpatient clinics).\nCHALLENGES: We placed the clinical pharmacogenomics implementation challenges into six categories: patient education and engagement in care decision making; clinician education and changes in standards of care; integration of technology into electronic health record systems; translational and implementation sciences in real-world clinical environments; regulatory and reimbursement considerations, and challenges in measuring outcomes. A cross-cutting theme was the need for careful attention to workflow. Our clinical setting, a safety-net health care system, presented some distinctive challenges. Patients often had multiple chronic illnesses and sometimes were taking more than one pharmacogenomics-relevant medication. Reaching patients for recruitment or follow-up was another challenge.\nCONCLUSIONS: New, large-scale endeavors in health care are challenging.

        "abstract": "Purpose Patients who are diagnosed with stage IV metastatic melanoma have an estimated 5-year relative survival rate of only 17%. Randomized controlled trials of recent US Food and Drug Administration-approved immune checkpoint inhibitors-pembrolizumab (PEM), nivolumab (NIVO), and ipilumumab (IPI)-demonstrate improved patient outcomes, but the optimal treatment sequence in patients with BRAF wild-type metastatic melanoma remains unclear. To inform policy makers about the value of these treatments, we developed a Markov model to compare the cost-effectiveness of different strategies for sequencing novel agents for the treatment of advanced melanoma. Materials and Methods We developed Markov models by using a US-payer perspective and lifetime horizon to estimate costs (2016 US$) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for treatment sequences with first-line NIVO, IPI, NIVO + IPI, PEM every 2 weeks, and PEM every 3 weeks. Health states were defined for initial treatment, first and second progression, and death. Rates for drug discontinuation, frequency of adverse events, disease progression, and death obtained from randomized phase III trials were used to determine the likelihood of transition between states. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate model uncertainty. Results PEM every 3 weeks followed by second-line IPI was both more effective and less costly than dacarbazine followed by IPI then NIVO, or IPI followed by NIVO. Compared with the first-line dacarbazine treatment strategy, NIVO followed by IPI produced an incremental cost effectiveness ratio of $90,871/QALY, and first-line NIVO + IPI followed by carboplatin plus paclitaxel chemotherapy produced an incremental cost effectiveness ratio of $198,867/QALY. Conclusion For patients with treatment-naive BRAF wild-type advanced melanoma, first-line PEM every 3 weeks followed by second-line IPI or first-line NIVO followed by second-line IPI are the most cost-effective, immune-based treatment strategies for metastatic melanoma.",

Although many aspects of the workup for acute leukemia are well accepted, few guidelines have addressed the different aspects of the diagnostic evaluation of samples from patients suspected to have acute leukemia.\nOBJECTIVE: - To develop a guideline for treating physicians and pathologists involved in the diagnostic and prognostic evaluation of new acute leukemia samples, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, and acute leukemias of ambiguous lineage.\nDESIGN: - The College of American Pathologists and the American Society of Hematology convened a panel of experts in hematology and hematopathology to develop recommendations. A systematic evidence review was conducted to address 6 key questions. Recommendations were derived from strength of evidence, feedback received during the public comment period, and expert panel consensus.\nRESULTS: - Twenty-seven guideline statements were established, which ranged from recommendations on what clinical and laboratory information should be available as part of the diagnostic and prognostic evaluation of acute leukemia samples to what types of testing should be performed routinely, with recommendations on where such testing should be performed and how the results should be reported.\nCONCLUSIONS: - The guideline provides a framework for the multiple steps, including laboratory testing, in the evaluation of acute leukemia samples. Some aspects of the guideline, especially molecular genetic testing in acute leukemia, are rapidly changing with new supportive literature, which will require on-going updates for the guideline to remain relevant.",

        "abstract": "Recognizing the heterogeneity of the Asian population with regards to acculturation, education, health awareness, and cultural values is vital for tailoring culturally sensitive and appropriate care. Prior studies show that cultural values influence perceptions of genetics within Asian populations. The reputation of the family unit factors into decisions such as pregnancy termination and disclosure of family medical history, and the nondirective model of American genetic counseling may conflict with the historical Asian model of paternalistic health care. Previous studies also provide conflicting evidence regarding correlations between education, acculturation, age, and awareness and perceptions of genetic testing. The aims of this study were to describe attitudes towards prenatal genetics among Southeast and East Asian women living in the United States for varying amounts of time and to explore sociocultural factors influencing those attitudes. Twenty-three Asian women who were members of Asian cultural organizations in the United States were interviewed via telephone about their attitudes towards prenatal genetic counseling, prenatal genetic testing, and termination of pregnancy. Responses were transcribed and coded for common themes using a thematic analysis approach. Four major themes emerged. In general, participants: (1) had diverse expectations for genetic counselors; (2) tended to weigh risks and benefits with regards to genetic testing decisions; (3) had mixed views on termination for lethal and non-lethal genetic conditions; and (4) identified cultural factors which influenced testing and termination such as lack of available resources, societal shame and stigma, and family pressure. These findings may allow prenatal genetic counselors to gain a richer, more nuanced understanding of their Asian patients and to offer culturally tailored prenatal genetic counseling.",

Genomic data from more than 20,000 cancer genomes provide a wealth of information on cancer gene alterations and have confirmed TP53 as the most commonly mutated gene in human cancer. Analysis of a database of 70,000 TP53 variants reveals that the two newly discovered exons of the gene, exons 9\u03b2 and 9\u03b3, generated by alternative splicing, are the targets of inactivating mutation events in breast, liver, and head and neck tumors. Furthermore, germline rearrange-ments in intron 1 of TP53 are associated with LFS and are frequently observed in sporadic osteosarcoma. In this context of constantly growing genomic data, we discuss how screening strategies must be improved when assessing TP53 status in clinical samples. Finally, we discuss how TP53 alterations should be described by using accurate nomenclature to avoid confusion in scientific and clinical reports. Cancer Res; 77(6); 1250-60. \u00a92017 AACR.",

We report on the clinical evaluation, immunological assessment, molecular analysis, and outcomes of SCID patients in a tertiary referral center in Iran.\nMETHODS: From January 2006 to December 2015, we performed a prospective cohort study in which initial screening and advanced immunological tests were carried out on patients suspected of having SCID. Genetic analysis was also performed to confirm the diagnosis.\nRESULTS: A total of 63 patients were diagnosed with SCID (43 male [68.3%]). The median age at onset and diagnosis and diagnostic delay were 40 and 110 and 60 days respectively. A total of 49 patients (77.8%) had a history of BCG vaccination, and of these, one-third experienced BCG-associated complications. The most common clinical manifestations were pneumonia, recurrent oral candidiasis, chronic diarrhea, and failure to thrive. Of the thirteen patients who underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, 8 survived and 5 died before they could receive the transplant. Most patients (34.9%) were classified as having T-B-NK+ SCID and had a mutation in the RAG2 or RAG1 gene.\nCONCLUSIONS: Autosomal recessive SCID is the most common type in Iranian patients. Providing high-quality training to physicians and patients' families to reduce the diagnostic delay should be prioritized. It is also important to raise awareness of live vaccination and to expand stem cell donor registries to speed up the transplantation process.",

The 'European Board of Medical Genetics division - Clinical Laboratory Geneticist' provides now since 3 years the possibility to register as an ErCLG. Applicants may be from all European countries and since this year also from outside of Europe. Five subtitles reflect the exact specialty of each ErCLG, who can reregister every 5 years. A previously not possible statistics based on ~300 individuals from 19 countries as holders of an ErCLG title provides interesting insights into the professionals working in human genetics. It could be substantiated that there are around twice as many females than males and that a PhD title was achieved by 80% of registered ErCLGs. Also most ErCLGs are still trained as generalists (66%), followed by such ErCLGs with focus on molecular genetics (23%); the remaining are concentrated either on clinical (6%), tumor (4%) or biochemical genetics (1%).

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Preventive breast surgery and MRI screening are offered to unaffected BRCA mutation carriers. The clinical benefit of these two modalities has not been evaluated among mutation carriers with a history of ovarian cancer. Thus, we sought to determine whether or not BRCA mutation carriers with ovarian cancer would benefit from preventive mastectomy or from MRI screening.\nMETHODS: First, the annual mortality rate for ovarian cancer patients was estimated for a cohort of 178 BRCA mutation carriers from Ontario, Canada. Next, the actuarial risk of developing breast cancer was estimated using an international registry of 509 BRCA mutation carriers with ovarian cancer. A series of simulations was conducted to evaluate the reduction in the probability of death (from all causes) associated with mastectomy and with MRI-based breast surveillance. Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate the impacts of mastectomy and MRI screening on breast cancer incidence as well as on all-cause mortality.\nRESULTS: Twenty (3.9%) of the 509 patients developed breast cancer within ten years following ovarian cancer diagnosis. The actuarial risk of developing breast cancer at ten years post-diagnosis, conditional on survival from ovarian cancer and other causes of mortality was 7.8%. Based on our simulation results, among all BRCA mutation-carrying patients diagnosed with stage III/IV ovarian cancer at age 50, the chance of dying before age 80 was reduced by less than 1% with MRI and by less than 2% with mastectomy. Greater improvements in survival with MRI or mastectomy were observed for women who had already survived 10years after ovarian cancer, and for women with stage I or II ovarian cancer.\nCONCLUSIONS: Among BRCA mutation-carrying ovarian cancer patients without a personal history of breast cancer, neither preventive mastectomy nor MRI screening is warranted, except for those who have survived ovarian cancer without recurrence for ten years and for those with early stage ovarian cancer.",

We report findings of a pilot study that evaluates how different subsidy schemes\u00a0impact genetic testing uptake and total cost of cancer management.\nMETHODS: We included all patients who attended the Cancer Genetics Service at the National Cancer Centre Singapore (January 2014-May 2016). Two subsidy schemes, the blanket scheme (100% subsidy to all eligible patients), and the varied scheme (patients received 50%-100% subsidy dependent on financial status) were compared. We estimated total spending on cancer management from government's perspective using a decision model.\nRESULTS: 445 patients were included. Contrasting against the blanket scheme, the varied scheme observed a higher attendance of patients (34 vs 8 patients per month), of which a higher proportion underwent genetic testing (5% vs 38%), while lowering subsidy spending per person (S$1098 vs S$1161). The varied scheme may potentially save cost by reducing unnecessary cancer surveillance when first-degree relatives uptake rate is above 36%.\nFINDINGS: Provision of subsidy leads to a considerable increase in genetic testing uptake rate.

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: BRCA mutation testing has been used for screening women at high risk of breast and ovarian cancer and for selecting the best treatment for those with breast cancer. To optimize the infrastructure and medical resources allocation for genetic testing, it is important to understand the use of BRCA mutation testing in the U.S. health system.\nMETHODS: This retrospective cohort study included 53,254 adult women with insurance claims for BRCA mutation testing between 2004 and 2014 from ClinformaticsTM Data Mart Database. Data analysis was performed in 2016. This study assessed trends in the use of BRCA mutation testing in women with previously diagnosed breast or ovarian cancer and those without (unaffected women).\nRESULTS: Between 2004 and 2014, of those receiving BRCA testing, the proportion of BRCA tests performed in unaffected women increased significantly (p<0.001), from 24.3% in 2004 to 61.5% in 2014. An increase in the proportion of BRCA tests used in unaffected women was found in each characteristic subgroup. In 2014, most subgroups had a proportion surpassing 50%, except for those aged 51-65 years and those without a family history of breast cancer. There was a much lower proportion of those aged 20-40 years among tested women with previously diagnosed breast or ovarian cancer than in unaffected women (17.6% vs 41.7%, p<0.001).\nCONCLUSIONS: During the past decade, the role of BRCA testing has gradually shifted from being used primarily in cancer patients to being used in unaffected women in the U.S.",

This information is important to better understand the disease burden of HSV in early life and to formulate public health interventions.\nMETHODS: Retrospective analysis of Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) national mortality data from 1999- 2011 in children aged <15 years who died with specific ICD-10 codes for HSV infection listed as an underlying or contributing cause.\nRESULTS: Twenty nine HSV-associated deaths in children aged <15 years from 1999-2011 were identified (0.05 per 100,000 children; 95% CI 0.04-0.06), 16 in the first month of life (0.45 per 100,000 live births; 95% CI 0.23- 0.67). Among those, 20 were males and 9 were females (p=0.04). The majority of deaths (69%) occurred in infants aged <12 months and most in infants aged <1 month (55%). HSV-associated death in infants aged < 1 month of age accounted for 0.15% of all neonatal deaths for 1999-2011 in Australia. A downward trend in HSV-associated neonatal mortality was observed between 1999 and 2011 (p=0.52). During the study period, mortality from HSV infections in Australian children resulted in an estimated 2,275 age-adjusted years of potential life lost.\nCONCLUSIONS: This data confirms reported findings from active surveillance of a downward trend in mortality rate from HSV infection in infants aged < 1 month in Australia over this period. Ongoing surveillance is required to confirm this observation.",

Despite comprehensive molecular characterization of bladder cancer, associations of molecular alterations with treatment response are still largely unknown. We selected pathologic complete responders (ypT0N0; n=38) and nonresponders (higher than ypT2; n=33) from a cohort of high-grade MIBC patients treated with NAC. DNA was isolated from prechemotherapy tumor tissue and used for next-generation sequencing of 178 cancer-associated genes (discovery cohort) or targeted sequencing (validation cohort). We found that 9 of 38 complete responders had erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2 (ERBB2) missense mutations, whereas none of 33 nonresponders had ERBB2 mutations (p=0.003). ERBB2 missense mutations in complete responders were mostly confirmed activating mutations. ERCC2 missense mutations, recently found associated with response to NAC, were more common in complete responders; however, this association did not reach statistical significance in our cohort. We conclude that ERBB2 missense mutations characterize a subgroup of MIBC patients with an excellent response to NAC.\nPATIENT SUMMARY: In this report we looked for genetic alterations that can predict the response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in bladder cancer.

Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) can be proposed to couples at risk of transmitting the disease, that is, when the female carries a premutation or a full mutation. We describe two new single-cell, single-round multiplex PCR for indirect and direct diagnosis of FraX on biopsied embryos. These tests include five unpublished, highly heterozygous simple sequence repeats, and the co-amplification of non-expanded CGG repeats for the direct test. Heterozygosity of the new markers ranged from 69 to 81%. The mean rate of non-informative marker included in the tests was low (26% and 23% for the new indirect and direct tests, respectively). This strategy allows offering a PGD for FraX to 96% of couples requesting it in our centre. A conclusive genotype was obtained in all cells with a rate of cells presenting an allele dropout ranging from 17% for the indirect test to 26% for the direct test. The new indirect test was applied for eight PGD cycles: 32 embryos were analysed, 9 were transferred and 3 healthy babies were born. By multiplexing these highly informative markers, robustness of the diagnosis is improved and the loss of potentially healthy embryos (because they are non-diagnosed or misdiagnosed) is limited. This may increase the chances of success of couples requesting a PGD for FraX, in particular, when premature ovarian insufficiency in premutated women leads to a reduced number of embryos available for analysis.",

        "abstract": "The increasingly large amount of data produced in healthcare (e.g. collected through health information systems such as electronic medical records - EMRs or collected through novel data sources such as personal health records - PHRs, social media, web resources) enable the creation of detailed records about people's health, sentiments and activities (e.g. physical activity, diet, sleep quality) that can be used in the public health area among others. However, despite the transformative potential of big data in public health surveillance there are several challenges in integrating big data. In this paper, the interoperability challenge is tackled and a semantic Extract Transform Load (ETL) service is proposed that seeks to semantically annotate big data to result into valuable data for analysis. This service is considered as part of a health analytics engine on the cloud that interacts with existing healthcare information exchange networks, like the Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise (IHE), PHRs, sensors, mobile applications, and other web resources to retrieve patient health, behavioral and daily activity data. The semantic ETL service aims at semantically integrating big data for use by analytic mechanisms. An illustrative implementation of the service on big data which is potentially relevant to human obesity, enables using appropriate analytic techniques (e.g. machine learning, text mining) that are expected to assist in identifying patterns and contributing factors (e.g. genetic background, social, environmental) for this social phenomenon and, hence, drive health policy changes and promote healthy behaviors where residents live, work, learn, shop and play.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Incompleteness of epidemiological databases is a major drawback when it comes to analyzing data. We conceived an epidemiological study to assess the association between newborn thyroid function and the exposure to perchlorates found in the tap water of the mother's home. Only 9% of newborn's exposure to perchlorate was known. The aim of our study was to design, test and evaluate an original method for imputing perchlorate exposure of newborns based on their maternity of birth.\nMETHODS: In a first database, an exhaustive collection of newborn's thyroid function measured during a systematic neonatal screening was collected. In this database the municipality of residence of the newborn's mother was only available for 2012. Between 2004 and 2011, the closest data available was the municipality of the maternity of birth. Exposure was assessed using a second database which contained the perchlorate levels for each municipality. We computed the catchment area of every maternity ward based on the French nationwide exhaustive database of inpatient stay. Municipality, and consequently perchlorate exposure, was imputed by a weighted draw in the catchment area. Missing values for remaining covariates were imputed by chained equation. A linear mixture model was computed on each imputed dataset. We compared odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) estimated on real versus imputed 2012 data. The same model was then carried out for the whole imputed database.\nRESULTS: The ORs estimated on 36,695 observations by our multiple imputation method are comparable to the real 2012 data. On the 394,979 observations of the whole database, the ORs remain stable but the 95% CI tighten considerably.\nDISCUSSION: The model estimates computed on imputed data are similar to those calculated on real data. The main advantage of multiple imputation is to provide unbiased estimate of the ORs while maintaining their variances. Thus, our method will be used to increase the statistical power of future studies by including all 394,979 newborns.",

Since the knowledge of reference values of a normal micturition serves as a guide to diagnose urologic pathology, the aim of this systematic review is to obtain a more comprehensive picture of normal voiding pattern in healthy infants, who have not yet reached bladder control. The systematic literature search was performed in two databases. This systematic review was conducted by the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA statement). Twenty-one studies were selected that demonstrate factors associated with voiding pattern. Diuresis, interrupted voiding, post-void residual urine and voiding frequency are parameters decreasing with age. Bladder capacity, the lowest volume triggering micturition, flow rate, voiding volume and the level of awake voiding expand with age.\nCONCLUSION: When evaluating the voiding pattern in infants, the normal evaluation of micturition parameters in healthy normal developing infants must be taken into consideration.\nWHAT IS KNOWN: \u2022 Different voiding parameters in healthy infants who are not yet toilet trained are reported. \u2022 Voiding was believed to be induced by a constant bladder volume, while nowadays, it is detected that infants possess a functional spino-pontospinal voiding pathway.\nWHAT IS NEW: \u2022 Arousal was detected in less than 60\u2009% of all preterm micturitions, while it was present in more than 90\u2009% of the micturitions of healthy \"term\" infants. \u2022 Voided volume, bladder capacity, and flow rate tend to increase with age.

Transcranial color-coded Doppler (TCCD) assures high accuracy in diagnosing right-to-left shunt (RLS) and its functional aspects. Aim of the study was to evaluate RLS prevalence and degree in subjects submitted to TCCD for conditions theoretically associated or caused by paradoxical embolism to the brain.\nMETHODS: PFO assessment, performed in 10 major diagnostic categories and a control group, followed a standardized protocol with a 10 or 20 microbubbles (MB) cutoff to identify any or only large RLS, respectively.\nRESULTS: Among 2113 patients, a significant larger RLS prevalence was found in stroke (53.3%), TIA (45.7%) and migraine with aura (39.7%) when compared with non-migraineurs controls (25.5%). RLS degree was significantly higher in stroke and TIA patients: The ROC curve from MB load data helped to identify new cutoff values for both normal breathing (42 MB) and Valsalva (139 MB) tests. From logistic regression, a family history for PFO, ASA, and male gender appeared independent predictors of a RLS. By contrast, RLS seemed independent of white matter abnormalities presence on brain neuroimaging or stroke mimics.\nCONCLUSIONS: In addition to recently defined criteria, genetically determined inheritable traits and epidemiologic characteristics (male gender) should be taken into account when assessing PFO and related cerebrovascular risk profile.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Brugada syndrome (BrS) is among the more common familial arrhythmia syndromes, with an estimated prevalence of 1 to 5 per 10 000 persons. It is characterized by a right ventricular conduction delay, dynamic or persistent ST-segment elevations in the precordial leads V1-3 , and an elevated risk of syncope and sudden cardiac death in young adults without structural heart disease.\nMETHODS: This article is based on original and review articles on BrS that appeared in English from 2010 onward and were retrieved by a selective search in PubMed, with special attention to international consensus publications on inherited arrhythmogenic diseases.\nRESULTS: According to the new diagnostic criteria, the diagnosis of BrS requires typical ECG changes in only one precordial lead. This will likely increase sensitivity, but may also lead to an increase in asymptomatic patients. Established risk markers include sudden cardiac arrest and a spontaneous type 1 ECG with arrhythmic syncope. Patients with these findings benefit from the implantation of a cardioverter-defibrillator. There is no validated algorithm for risk stratification of asymptomatic patients. Because of the low prevalence of BrS, there have been no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in this disease, and all recommendations are based on expert opinion. BrS is usually inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Recently discovered gene polymorphisms modify the risk of BrS, challenging the conception of BrS as a monogenetic disease. Electro-anatomic mapping studies have revealed, for the first time, an arrhythmogenic substrate over the right ventricular outflow tract in BrS patients.\nCONCLUSION: BrS is one important differential diagnosis to consider in patients presenting with syncope or sudden cardiac arrest. The goal of current research is to achieve a deeper understanding of the genetic and electrophysiological changes underlying BrS. Further insights in these areas will probably enable better risk stratification of asymptomatic BrS patients in the future.",

Mate selection revolved around a belief that human heredity could be improved and genetic diseases eradicated through better breeding. Marriage counselling, though interested in reproduction, was also concerned with the emotional and psychological well-being of couples. These two practices coalesced most obviously in the work of well-known geneticist Sheldon Reed. Even as marriage and genetic counselling diverged in the post-WWII period, vestiges of these practices remain in contemporary counseling experiences with family planning and genetic screening programs. Emphasizing points of continuity between \"positive\" eugenic ideologies and modern genetic practices elaborates the diverse origins of genetic counseling. It also exposes how genetic counselors have become involved in genetic enterprises beyond standard clinical settings, and prods at key issues in the interaction between genetic science and social values.",

        "abstract": "Machaerium hirtum (Vell.) Stellfeld (M.hirtum) is a plant known as 'jacarand\u00e1-bico-de-pato' whose bark is commonly used against diarrhea, cough and cancer. The aim of this study was to phytochemically characterise the hydroethanolic extract of this plant, investigate its antimutagenic activities using the Ames test and evaluate its effects on cell viability, genomic instability, gene expression and cell protection in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2). Antimutagenic activity was assessed by simultaneous pre- and post-treatment with direct and indirect mutagens, such as 4-nitro-o-phenylenediamine (NPD), mitomycin C (MMC), benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) and aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), using the Ames test, cytokinesis blocking micronucleus and apoptosis assays. Only 3 of the 10 concentrations evaluated in the MTT assay were cytotoxic in HepG2 cells. Micronucleated or apoptotic cells were not observed with any of the tested concentrations, and there were no mutagenic effects in the bacterial system. However, the Nuclear Division Index and flow cytometry data showed a decrease in cell proliferation. The extract showed an inhibitory effect against direct (NPD) and indirect mutagens (B[a]P and AFB1). Furthermore, pre- and post-treated cells showed significant reduction in the number of apoptotic and micronucleated cells. This effect is not likely to be associated with the modulation of antioxidant genes, as shown by the RT-qPCR results. Six known flavonoids were identified in the hydroethanolic extract of Machaerium hirtum leaves, and their structures were elucidated by spectroscopic and spectrophotometric methods. The presence of the antioxidants apigenin and luteolin may explain these protective effects, because these components can inhibit the formation of reactive species and prevent apoptosis and DNA damage. In conclusion, the M.hirtum extract showed chemopreventive potential and was not hazardous at the tested concentrations in the experiments presented here. Moreover, this extract should be investigated further as a chemopreventive agent.",

        "abstract": "AIMS: A combination of variable expression, age-related penetrance, and unpredictable arrhythmic events complicates management of relatives of arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy (ARVD/C) patients. We aimed to (i) determine predictors of ARVD/C diagnosis and (ii) optimize arrhythmic risk stratification among first-degree relatives of ARVD/C patients.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Detailed phenotypic and outcome data of 274 first-degree relatives (46% male; 36.5 \u00b1 18.9 years) of 138 ARVD/C probands were obtained. Ninety-six (35%) relatives were diagnosed with ARVD/C according to 2010 Task Force Criteria (TFC). Siblings had a three-fold-increased risk of ARVD/C diagnosis compared with parents and children (odds ratio 3.11, P < 0.001). Multivariable logistic regression identified symptoms (P < 0.001), being a sibling (P < 0.001), the presence of a pathogenic mutation (P < 0.001), and female sex (P = 0.010) as predictors of ARVD/C diagnosis. During 6.7 \u00b1 3.8 years of follow-up, 21 (8%) relatives experienced a sustained ventricular arrhythmia (cycle length 271 \u00b1 48 ms). While being a sibling was a predictor of ARVD/C diagnosis, neither relatedness to the proband (P = 0.185) nor malignant family history (P = 0.347) was significantly associated with arrhythmic events. Meeting TFC independent of family history criteria had higher prognostic value for arrhythmic events than conventional 2010 TFC, which include family history [area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.95 (95% CI 0.93-0.97) vs. 0.85 (95% CI 0.82-0.88), P < 0.001].\nCONCLUSION: One-third of first-degree relatives develop manifest ARVD/C. Siblings have highest risk of disease, even after correcting for age and sex. Fulfilment of TFC independent of family history is superior to conventional TFC for arrhythmic risk stratification of relatives.",

        "abstract": "Acute myeloid leukemia is a clonal but heterogeneous disease differing in molecular pathogenesis, clinical features and response to chemotherapy. This latter frequently consists of a combination of cytarabine and anthracyclines, although etoposide, demethylating agents, and other drugs are also used. Unfortunately, chemoresistance is a common and serious problem. Multiple mechanisms account for impaired effectiveness of drugs and reduced levels of active agents in target cells. The latter can be due to lower drug uptake, increased export or decreased intracellular proportion of active/inactive agent due to changes in the expression/function of enzymes responsible for the activation of pro-drugs and the inactivation of active agents. Characterization of the \"resistome\", or profile of expressed genes accounting for multi-drug resistance (MDR) phenotype, would permit to predict the lack of response to chemotherapy and would help in the selection of the best pharmacological regime for each patient and moment, and to develop strategies of chemosensitization.",

        "abstract": "The link HaWUS/ HaL1L , the opposite transcriptional behavior, and the decrease/increase in positive histone marks bond to both genes suggest an inhibitory effect of WUS on HaL1L in sunflower zygotic embryos. In Arabidopsis, a group of transcription factors implicated in the earliest events of embryogenesis is the WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX (WOX) protein family including WUSCHEL (WUS) and other 14 WOX protein, some of which contain a conserved WUS-box domain in addition to the homeodomain. WUS transcripts appear very early in embryogenesis, at the 16-cell embryo stage, but gradually become restricted to the center of the developing shoot apical meristem (SAM) primordium and continues to be expressed in cells of the niche/organizing center of SAM and floral meristems to maintain stem cell population. Moreover, WUS has decisive roles in the embryonic program presumably promoting the vegetative-to-embryonic transition and/or maintaining the identity of the embryonic stem cells. However, data on the direct interaction between WUS and key genes for seed development (as LEC1 and L1L) are not collected. The novelty of this report consists in the characterization of Helianthus annuus WUS (HaWUS) gene and in its analysis regarding the pattern of the methylated lysine 4 (K4) of the Histone H3 and of the acetylated histone H3 during the zygotic embryo development. Also, a parallel investigation was performed for HaL1L gene since two copies of the WUS-binding site (WUSATA), previously identified on HaL1L nucleotide sequence, were able to be bound by the HaWUS recombinant protein suggesting a not described effect of HaWUS on HaL1L transcription.",

Two couples requesting PGD for VUS are presented. The first couple requested PGD for Lynch syndrome. Whole exome sequencing identified in a healthy male with a family history of Lynch-associated tumours, a MLH1 missense variant. The variant had not been reported as pathogenic, but was predicted as damaging by algorithms.

As chromosomal microarrays and whole-exome sequencing are becoming standard tests, couples are requesting PGD for these VUS. The risk of possible genetic diseases can be reduced by carrying out PGD for uncertain findings, yet will inevitably lead to the birth of affected children despite the transfer of embryos that are not carriers of the familial variants.

The objective of the current study was to identify causes and risk factors for perinatal deaths among the tribal population in Jawadhi Hills, Tamil Nadu, southern India.\nMETHODS: A community-based case control study design was used, where a case was a perinatal death and controls were from a sampling frame of all children who were born alive in the same area \u00b17 days from the day of birth of the case. The WHO Standard International Verbal Autopsy form was used to arrive at the cause of death. Univariate and multivariate analyses for factors associated with perinatal deaths were done.\nRESULTS: A total of 40 cases, including 22 early neonatal deaths and 18 stillbirths, and 110 controls were included in the study. Among the perinatal deaths, 40% were born prematurely. Sepsis (17.5%) and birth asphyxias (12.5%) were the major causes of deaths. In the final logistic regression model, parity \u22654 (odds ratio [OR] 5.75 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.88-17.54]), preterm births (OR 5.62 [95% CI 2.12-16.68]) and time to reach the nearest health facility more than two hours (OR 2.51 [95% CI 1.086.73]) were significantly associated with the perinatal deaths.\nCONCLUSIONS: Prematurity, poor accessibility and a high parity were significantly associated with perinatal deaths in the tribal population of Jawadhi Hills.",

However its role in recurrent VTE is still controversial.\nOBJECTIVES: To investigate whether the presence of FHVTE is a risk factor for VTE recurrence in patients from a well-characterized Malm\u00f6 thrombophilia study.\nMETHODS: VTE patients from the Malm\u00f6 Thrombophilia Study were followed from discontinuation of warfarin treatment until diagnosis of VTE recurrence or to the end of the study (maximum follow-up 9.8 years).\nRESULTS: There were 127 events of VTE recurrence (12.2%) registered during the follow-up. Multivariate Cox regression analysis in patients with unprovoked first VTE showed that FHVTE was associated with higher risk of VTE recurrence (hazard ratio [HR] 1.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2-2.9) compared with patients with no FHVTE. Stratification of data according to thrombophilia status of patients showed that compared with the reference group (no FHVTE or thrombophilia), thrombophilia together with FHVTE was associated with a higher risk of VTE recurrence (HR 3.2, 95% CI 1.8-5.9) than thrombophilia alone (HR 1.8, 95% CI 1.02-3.2) independent of DVT location and duration of warfarin treatment. FHVTE was mainly an important risk factor of VTE recurrence in women (HR 3.1, 95% CI 1.6-5.8) but not in men (HR 1.1, 95% CI 0.6-2.2).\nCONCLUSION: Our results show that FHVTE is a risk factor for VTE recurrence in patients who had unprovoked first VTE.

We have now applied such testing to detect actionable mutations that may inform treatment recommendations in lung cancer.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: We prospectively applied amplicon sequencing panels that cover both mutational hotspots in 22 genes related to lung and colon tumorigenesis as well as 72 major variants of ALK, RET, ROS1, and NTRK1 fusion transcripts. We then determined the proportion of patients who received genotype-directed therapy and their overall survival (OS).\nRESULTS: Tumor specimens from 110 patients with lung cancer recruited between July 2013 and March 2015 were analyzed. The most common genetic alterations were TP53 mutations in 42 patients, followed by EGFR mutations in 25, STK11 mutations in 12, and KRAS mutations in 10. Potentially actionable mutations were identified in 44 patients including 50% of those with adenocarcinoma and 14% of those with squamous cell carcinoma.

        "abstract": "The possibility that exposure to general anesthetics during early life results in long-term impairment of neural function attracted considerable interest over the past decade. Extensive laboratory data suggest that administration of these drugs during critical stages of central nervous system development can lead to cell death, impaired neurogenesis, and synaptic growth as well as cognitive deficits. These observations are corroborated by several recent human epidemiological studies arguing that such cognitive impairment might also occur in humans. Despite the potential public health importance of this issue, several important questions remain open. Amongst them, how the duration of anesthesia exposure impact on outcome is as yet not fully elucidated. To gain insight into this question, here we focused on the short- and long-term impact of a 30-min-long exposure to clinically relevant concentrations of sevoflurane in rat pups at 2 functionally distinct stages of the brain growth spurt. We show that this treatment paradigm induced developmental stage-dependent and brain region-specific acute but not lasting changes in dendritic spine densities. Electrophysiological recordings in hippocampal brain slices from adult animals exposed to anesthesia in the early postnatal period revealed larger paired-pulse facilitation but no changes in the long-term potentiation paradigm when compared with nonanesthetized controls. 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine pulse and pulse-chase experiments demonstrated that neither proliferation nor differentiation and survival of hippocampal progenitors were affected by sevoflurane exposure. In addition, behavioral testing of short- and long-term memory showed no differences between control and sevoflurane-exposed animals. Overall, these results suggest that brief sevoflurane exposure during critical periods of early postnatal development, although it does not seem to exert major long-term effects on brain circuitry development, can induce subtle changes in synaptic plasticity and spine density of which the physiological significance remains to be determined.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Tumor genotyping is a powerful tool for guiding non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) care; however, comprehensive tumor genotyping can be logistically cumbersome. To facilitate genotyping, we developed a next-generation sequencing (NGS) assay using a desktop sequencer to detect actionable mutations and rearrangements in cell-free plasma DNA (cfDNA).\nEXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: An NGS panel was developed targeting 11 driver oncogenes found in NSCLC. Targeted NGS was performed using a novel methodology that maximizes on-target reads, and minimizes artifact, and was validated on DNA dilutions derived from cell lines. Plasma NGS was then blindly performed on 48 patients with advanced, progressive NSCLC and a known tumor genotype, and explored in two patients with incomplete tumor genotyping.\nRESULTS: NGS could identify mutations present in DNA dilutions at \u2265 0.4% allelic frequency with 100% sensitivity/specificity. Plasma NGS detected a broad range of driver and resistance mutations, including ALK, ROS1, and RET rearrangements, HER2 insertions, and MET amplification, with 100% specificity. Sensitivity was 77% across 62 known driver and resistance mutations from the 48 cases; in 29 cases with common EGFR and KRAS mutations, sensitivity was similar to droplet digital PCR. In two cases with incomplete tumor genotyping, plasma NGS rapidly identified a novel EGFR exon 19 deletion and a missed case of MET amplification.\nCONCLUSIONS: Blinded to tumor genotype, this plasma NGS approach detected a broad range of targetable genomic alterations in NSCLC with no false positives including complex mutations like rearrangements and unexpected resistance mutations such as EGFR C797S. Through use of widely available vacutainers and a desktop sequencing platform, this assay has the potential to be implemented broadly for patient care and translational research.",

GRP94 and FN14 are predictive biomarkers over-expressed in primary breast carcinomas that metastasized in brain. To further validate these brain metastasis biomarkers, we performed a multicenter study including 318 patients with breast carcinomas. Among these patients, there were 138 patients with metastasis, of whom 84 had brain metastasis. The likelihood of developing brain metastasis increased by 5.24-fold (95%CI 2.83-9.71) and 2.55- (95%CI 1.52-4.3) in the presence of FN14 and GRP94, respectively. Moreover, FN14 was more sensitive than ErbB2 (38.27 vs. 24.68) with similar specificity (89.43 vs. 89.55) to predict brain metastasis and had identical prognostic value than triple negative patients (p < 0.0001). Furthermore, we used GRP94 and FN14 pathways and GUILD, a network-based disease-gene prioritization program, to pinpoint the genes likely to be therapeutic targets, which resulted in FN14 as the main modulator and thalidomide as the best scored drug. The treatment of mice with brain metastasis improves survival decreasing reactive astrocytes and angiogenesis, and down-regulate FN14 and its ligand TWEAK.

Among the recently discovered genetic defects associated with leukodystrophies, several genes converge on a common mechanism involving protein transcription/translation and ER stress response.\nMETHODS: The genetic basis of a novel congenital leukodystrophy, associated with early onset spastic paraparesis, acquired microcephaly and optic atrophy was studied in six patients from three unrelated Ashkenazi-Jewish families. To this end we used homozygosity mapping, exome analysis, western blot (Hikeshi, HSF1-pS326 and b-actin) in patient fibroblasts, indirect immunofluorescence (HSP70 and HSF1) in patient fibroblasts undergoing heat shock stress, nuclear injection of plasmids expressing Hikeshi or EGFP in patient fibroblasts, in situ hybridization and Immunoblot analysis of Hikeshi in newborn and adult mouse brain.\nRESULTS: All the patients were homozygous for a missense mutation, p.Val54Leu, in C11ORF73 encoding HSP70 nuclear transporter protein, Hikeshi. The mutation segregated with the disease in the families and was carried by 1:200 Ashkenazi-Jewish individuals. The mutation was associated with undetectable level of Hikeshi in the patients' fibroblasts and with lack of nuclear HSP70 during heat shock stress, a phenomenon which was reversed upon the introduction of normal human Hikeshi to the patients cells. Hikeshi was found to be expressed in central white matter of mouse brain.\nCONCLUSIONS: These data underscore the importance of Hikeshi for HSP70 relocation into the nucleus. It is likely that in the absence of Hikeshi, HSP70 cannot attenuate the multiple heat shock induced nuclear phenotypes, leaving the cells unprotected during heat shock stress. We speculate that the sudden death of three of the six patients following a short febrile illness and the life-threatening myo-pericarditis in the fourth are the result of excess extra-nuclear HSP70 level which initiates cytokine release or provide target for natural killer cells. Alternatively, nuclear HSP70 might play an active role in stressed cells protection.",

Such genetic profiles must be scientifically validated before they is applied to general patient population. Reproducibility of findings that support such genetic profiles is a fundamental challenge in validation studies. The percentage of overlapping genes (POG) criterion and derivative methods produce unstable and misleading results. Furthermore, in a complex disease, comparisons between different tumor subtypes can produce high POG scores that do not capture the consistencies in the functions.\nRESULTS: We focused on the quality rather than the quantity of the overlapping genes. We defined the rank value of each gene according to importance or quality by PageRank on basis of a particular topological structure. Then, we used the p-value of the rank-sum of the overlapping genes (PRSOG) to evaluate the quality of reproducibility. Though the POG scores were low in different studies of the same disease, the PRSOG was statistically significant, which suggests that sets of differentially expressed genes might be highly reproducible.\nCONCLUSIONS: Evaluations of eight datasets from breast cancer, lung cancer and four other disorders indicate that quality-based PRSOG method performs better than a quantity-based method.

We studied 3 different model versions and calculated for each of them the net benefit associated with its adoption, measured as the value-adjusted reduction in stroke and bleeding events at 1 year, compared with i) the actual practice, or ii) recommending warfarin consistently with the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines, irrespective of HAS-BLED.\nRESULTS: We included 41,455 patients; 31.9% actually received warfarin.

Ninety-five consecutive patients with gastric cancer after D2 gastrectomy who received adjuvant chemotherapy combined with CIK cell therapy were enrolled. The MICA expression of their tumors was determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC). High expression of MICA protein was documented by IHC in 38 of 95 tumor samples (40.0 %). The MICA status was significantly associated with the age and stage, p = 0.008 and 0.023, respectively. Analysis of NKG2D on in vitro expanded CIK cells showed that the percentages of NKG2D+ in CD3+/CD56+, CD3-/CD56+, and CD3+/CD8+ cells populations were 97.2 \u00b1 1.4, 97.9 \u00b1 1.8, and 95.6 \u00b1 2.1 %, respectively.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Mucopolysaccharidosis type VI (MPS VI) is a rare, autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused by deficient enzymatic activity of N-acetyl galactosamine-4-sulphatase resulting from mutations in the arylsulphatase B (ARSB) gene. The ARSB gene is located on chromosome 5q11-q13 and is composed of eight exons. More than hundred ARSB mutations have been reported so far, but the mutation spectrum of MPS VI in India is still unknown. Hence, the aim of the present study was to identify the mutational spectrum in patients with MPS VI in India and to study the genotype-phenotype association and functional outcomes of these mutations.\nMETHODS: Molecular characterization of the ARSB gene by Sanger sequencing was done for 15 patients (aged 15 months to 11 yr) who were enzymatically confirmed to have MPS VI. Age of onset, clinical progression and enzyme activity levels in each patient were studied to look for genotype-phenotype association. Haplotype analysis performed for unrelated patients with the recurring mutation W450C, was suggestive of a founder effect. Sequence and structural analyses of the ARSB protein using standard software were carried out to determine the impact of detected mutations on the function of the ARSB protein.\nRESULTS: A total of 12 mutations were identified, of which nine were novel mutations namely, p.D53N, p.L98R, p.Y103SfsX9, p.W353X, p.H393R, p.F166fsX18, p.I220fsX5, p.W450L, and p.W450C, and three were known mutations (p.D54N, p.A237D and p.S320R). The nine novel sequence variants were confirmed not to be polymorphic variants by performing sequencing in 50 unaffected individuals from the same ethnic population.\nINTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: Nine novel mutations were identified in MPS VI cases from India in the present study. The study also provides some insights into the genotype-phenotype association in MPS VI.",

        "abstract": "STUDY QUESTION: What is the prevalence and developmental significance of morphologic nuclear abnormalities in human preimplantation embryos?\nSUMMARY ANSWER: Nuclear abnormalities are commonly found in human IVF embryos and are associated with DNA damage, aneuploidy, and decreased developmental potential.\nWHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Early human embryonic development is complicated by genomic errors that occur after fertilization. The appearance of extra-nuclear DNA, which has been observed in IVF, may be a result of such errors. However, the mechanism by which abnormal nuclei form and the impact on DNA integrity and embryonic development is not understood.\nSTUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Cryopreserved human cleavage-stage embryos (n = 150) and cryopreserved blastocysts (n = 105) from clinical IVF cycles performed between 1997 and 2008 were donated for research. Fresh embryos (n = 60) of poor quality that were slated for discard were also used. Immunohistochemical, microscopic and cytogenetic analyses at different developmental stages and morphologic grades were performed.\nPARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Embryos were fixed and stained for DNA, centromeres, mitotic activity and DNA damage and imaged using confocal microscopy. Rates of abnormal nuclear formation were compared between morphologically normal cleavage-stage embryos, morphologically normal blastocysts, and poor quality embryos. To control for clinical and IVF history of oocytes donors, and quality of frozen embryos within our sample, cleavage-stage embryos (n = 52) were thawed and fixed at different stages of development and then analyzed microscopically. Cleavage-stage embryos (n = 9) were thawed and all blastomeres (n = 62) were disaggregated, imaged and analyzed for karyotype. Correlations were made between microscopic and cytogenetic findings of individual blastomeres and whole embryos.\nMAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: The frequency of microscopic nuclear abnormalities was lower in blastocysts (5%; 177/3737 cells) than in cleavage-stage embryos (16%, 103/640 blastomeres, P < 0.05) and highest in arrested embryos (65%; 44/68 blastomeres, P < 0.05). DNA damage was significantly higher in cells with microscopic nuclear abnormalities (\u03b3H2AX (phosphorylated (Ser139) histone H2A.X): 87.1%, 74/85; replication protein A: 72.9%, 62/85) relative to cells with normal nuclear morphology (\u03b3H2AX: 9.3%, 60/642; RPA: 5.6%, 36/642) (P < 0.05). Blastomeres containing nuclear abnormalities were strongly associated with aneuploidy (Fisher exact test, two-tailed, P < 0.01).\nLIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The embryos used were de-identified, and the clinical and IVF history was unknown.\nWIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: This study explores a mechanism of abnormal embryonic development post-fertilization. While most of the current data have explored abnormal meiotic chromosome segregation in oocytes as a primary mechanism of reproductive failure, abnormal nuclear formation during early mitotic cell division in IVF embryos also plays a significant role. The detection of abnormal nuclear formation may have clinical application in noninvasive embryo selection during IVF.\nSTUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTERESTS: The study was supported by Columbia University and the New York Stem Cell Foundation.

This study aimed to identify disease causing mutations in 19 consanguineous families diagnosed with LAD1. Blood samples were collected after informed and written consent was obtained. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood of patients and their parents. PCR amplification of the ITGB2 gene was done using specific primers followed by sequencing for mutation detection. A total number of 14 alterations scattered throughout the ITGB2 gene were ascertained in which 10 mutations were previously reported, including c.329-6C>A, c.382G>T, c.715G>A, c.843delC, c.897+1G>A, c.1062A>T, c.1143delC, c.1877+2T>C, c.1907delA and c.2147G>C.

        "abstract": "Other-regarding preferences are considered to be the foundation of human cooperation. However, the evolutionary origin of this behavior in humans remains poorly understood. So far, comparative studies in primates have led to mixed conclusions probably due to methodological differences relating to both task complexity and the types of control conditions used. Moreover, no clear link between phylogenetic relatedness and prosociality has been found, suggesting that other convergent selection pressures may play a role in the evolution of such behaviors. Here, using one of the cognitively less demanding tasks, we show for the first time, that dogs can behave pro-socially by donating food to a conspecific partner, but only if the partner is familiar. This highlights the importance of considering the social relationships between individuals when testing animals for other-regarding behaviors. Moreover, by including a social control condition, we show that the dogs' prosocial response was not due to a simple social facilitation effect. The current findings support recent proposals that other convergent selection pressures, such as dependence on cooperative activities, rather than genetic relatedness to humans, may shape a species' propensity for other-regarding behaviors.",

Hence, the present study aims to map novel molecular markers and to identify QTLs for Fusarium wilt resistance in chickpea. An intraspecific linkage map of chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) was constructed using F10-F11 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from a cross between K850 and WR315 segregating for H2 locus. A set of 31 polymorphic simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers obtained by screening 300 SSRs and were used for genotyping.

Exome sequencing demonstrated compound heterozygous mutations in the NEK8 gene (Never in mitosis A-related Kinase 8), a ciliary kinase indispensable for cardiac and renal development based on murine studies. The mutations included a c.2069_2070insC variant (p.Ter693LeufsTer86), and a c.1043C>T variant (p.Thr348Met) in the highly conserved RCC1 (Regulation of Chromosome Condensation 1) domain. The RCC1 domain is crucial for localization of the NEK8 protein to the centrosomes and cilia. Mutations in NEK8 have been previously reported in three fetuses (from a single family) with renal-hepatic-pancreatic dysplasia 2 (RHPD2), similar to Ivemark syndrome, and in three individuals with nephronophthisis (NPHP9). This is the third report of disease-causing mutations in the NEK8 gene in humans and only the second describing multi-organ involvement. The clinical features we describe differ from those in the previously published report in that (1) a pancreatic phenotype was not observed in the individuals reported here, (2) there were more prominent cardiac findings, (consistent with observations in murine models), and (3) we observed bile duct hypoplasia rather than ductal plate malformation. The patients reported here expand our understanding of the NEK8-associated phenotype.

Our objective was to establish the spectrum of CFTR variants and their frequencies in CF patients in the United States with African, Native American, Asian, East Indian, or Middle Eastern backgrounds. By using direct DNA sequencing, we identified two CFTR variants in 89 of 140 affected nonwhite individuals with uncharacterized genotypes. Seven variants were novel. Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification detected 14 rearrangements in the remaining 51 patients, 6 of which were novel. Deletions and duplications accounted for 17% of unidentified alleles. A cross-sectional analysis of genotyping data from the CF Foundation Patient Registry was performed, comparing 3496 nonwhite patients with 22,206 white CF patients. Patients of Hispanic, black, or Asian ancestry were less likely to have two identified CFTR variants (P < 0.0001 for Hispanics and blacks, P = 0.003 for Asians), and more likely to carry no mutations on the commonly used 23 mutation carrier screening panel (P < 0.0001).

We show that sample size and minor allele frequency are the major determinants of the prevalence of perfect LD between unlinked loci but that demographic factors, such as deviations from random mating, can produce significant effects as well. Finally, we quantify this phenomenon in three model organisms and find thousands of pairs of moderate-frequency ([Formula: see text]) genetically indistinguishable variants in relatively large data sets.

        "abstract": "Recombinant human BMP-2 (rhBMP-2) is a potent osteoinductive agent, but has been associated not only with bone formation, but also osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption. Osteoprotegerin (OPG) is a RANKL inhibitor that blocks differentiation and function of osteoclasts. We hypothesized that the combination of local BMP-2 (recombinant protein or a product of gene therapy) plus systemic OPG-Fc is more effective than BMP-2 alone in promoting bone repair. To test this hypothesis we used a mouse critical-sized femoral defect model. Col2.3eGFP (osteoblastic marker) male mice were treated with rhBMP-2 (group I), rhBMP-2 and systemic OPG (group II), rhBMP-2 and delayed administration of OPG (group III), mouse BM cells transduced with a lentiviral vector containing the BMP-2 gene (LV-BMP-2; group IV), LV-BMP-2 and systemic OPG (group V), a carrier alone (group VI) and administration of OPG alone (group VII). All bone defects treated with BMP-2 (alone or combined with OPG) healed, whereas minimal bone formation was noted in animals treated with the carrier alone or OPG alone. MicroCT analysis showed that bone volume (BV) in rhBMP-2+OPG and LV-BMP-2+OPG groups was significantly higher compared to rhBMP-2 alone (p<0.01) and LV-BMP-2 alone (p<0.001). Similar results were observed in histomorphometry, with rhBMP-2 alone defects exhibiting significantly lower bone area (B.Ar) compared to rhBMP-2+OPG defects (p<0.005) and LV-BMP-2 defects having a significantly lower B.Ar compared to all BMP-2+OPG treated groups (p\u22640.01). TRAP staining demonstrated a major osteoclast response in the groups that did not receive OPG (rhBMP-2, LV-BMP-2 and sponge alone) beginning as early as 7days post-operatively. In conclusion, we demonstrated that locally delivered BMP-2 (recombinant protein or gene therapy) in combination with systemically administered OPG improved bone healing compared to BMP-2 alone in a mouse critical-sized bone defect. These data indicate that osteoclasts can diminish healing responses to BMP-2 and that RANKL inhibition may thus accentuate BMP-2 efficacy.",

GUARDD is a randomized trial to evaluate the effects and challenges of incorporating genetic risk information into primary care. Hypertensive, non-diabetic, adults with self-reported African ancestry, without kidney dysfunction, are recruited from diverse clinical settings and randomized to undergo APOL1 genetic testing at baseline (intervention) or at one year (waitlist control).

Despite its importance, there is still limited evidence in support of some prominent theoretical models explaining the maintenance of genetic polymorphism within populations. We examined 84 populations of Xiphophorus variatus, a livebearing fish with a genetic polymorphism associated with physiological performance, to test: (1) whether niche differentiation explains broad-scale maintenance of polymorphism, (2) whether polymorphism is maintained among populations by local adaptation and migration, or (3) whether heterogeneity in explicit environmental variables could be linked to levels of polymorphism within populations. We found no evidence of climatic niche differentiation that could generate or maintain broad geographic variation in polymorphism. Subsequently, hierarchical partitioning of genetic richness and partial mantel tests revealed that 76% of the observed genetic richness was partitioned within populations with no effect of geographic distance on polymorphism. These results strongly suggest a lack of migration-selection balance in the maintenance of polymorphism, and model selection confirmed a significant relationship between environmental heterogeneity and genetic richness within populations. Few studies have demonstrated such effects at this scale, and additional studies in other taxa should examine the generality of gene-by-environment interactions across populations to better understand the dynamics and scale of balancing selection.",

Surgical timing, adequacy of the treatment, and frequency of prophylactic thyroidectomy (PTx) in mutation carriers were also assessed.\nMETHODS: Genetic testing for MTC and pheochromocytoma was conducted between July 2008 and January 2012 in 512 patients. Application forms and RET mutation analyses of these patients whose blood samples were sent from various centers around Turkey were assessed retrospectively. An evaluation form was sent to the physicians of the eligible 319 patients who had confirmed sporadic MTC, familial MTC (FMTC), multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2), or who were mutation carriers. Physicians were asked to give information about the surgical history, latest calcitonin levels, morbidity, mortality, genetic screening, and PTx among family members. Twenty-five centers responded by filling in the forms of 192 patients.\nRESULTS: Among the 319 patients, RET mutation was detected in 71 (22.3%). Cys634Arg mutation was the most prevalent mutation (43.7%), followed by Val804Met in 18 patients (25.4%), and Cys634Tyr in 6 patients (8.5%). Among 192 MTC patients, the diagnosis was sporadic MTC in 146 (76.4%), FMTC in 14 (7.3%), MEN2A in 15 patients (7.9%), and MEN2B in one patient. The number of mutation carriers among 154 apparently sporadic MTC patients was 8 (5.2%). Ten patients were submitted to PTx out of twenty-four mutation carriers at a mean age of 35\u00b119 years.\nCONCLUSION: Turkish people have a similar RET proto-oncogene mutation distribution when compared to other Mediterranean countries. Despite free RET gene testing, the number of the PTx in Turkey is limited and relatively late in the life span of the carriers. This is mainly due to patient and family incompliance and incomplete family counselling.",

We describe the methods used to establish and follow a cohort of 1,040 girls ages 6-13 years at baseline, half with a breast cancer family history, and the collection of questionnaire data (family history, early life exposures, growth and development, psychosocial and behavioral), anthropometry, biospecimens, and breast tissue characteristics using optical spectroscopy.\nRESULTS: During this initial 5-year phase of the study, follow-up visits are conducted every 6 months for repeated data and biospecimen collection. Participation in baseline components was high (98% for urine, 97.5% for blood or saliva, and 98% for anthropometry). At enrollment, 77% of girls were premenarcheal and 49% were at breast Tanner stage T1.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study design allows thorough examination of events affecting girls' growth and development and how they differ across the spectrum of breast cancer risk. A better understanding of early life breast cancer risk factors will be essential to enhance prevention across the lifespan for those with and without a family history of the disease.",

        "abstract": "The utility of blood-based omic profiles for linking environmental exposures to their potential health effects was evaluated in 649 individuals, drawn from the general population, in relation to tobacco smoking, an exposure with well-characterised health effects. Using disease connectivity analysis, we found that the combination of smoking-modified, genome-wide gene (including miRNA) expression and DNA methylation profiles predicts with remarkable reliability most diseases and conditions independently known to be causally associated with smoking (indicative estimates of sensitivity and positive predictive value 94% and 84%, respectively). Bioinformatics analysis reveals the importance of a small number of smoking-modified, master-regulatory genes and suggest a central role for altered ubiquitination. The smoking-induced gene expression profiles overlap significantly with profiles present in blood cells of patients with lung cancer or coronary heart disease, diseases strongly associated with tobacco smoking. These results provide proof-of-principle support to the suggestion that omic profiling in peripheral blood has the potential of identifying early, disease-related perturbations caused by toxic exposures and may be a useful tool in hazard and risk assessment.",

        "abstract": "The skin barrier, formed by the stratum corneum, envelops our bodies and provides an essential protective function. However, this barrier function differs between individuals due to biological variation. This variation arises as a result of inherited genetic variants, negative environmental or extrinsic factors, and age. A multitude of genetic changes determine a person's predisposition to a skin barrier defect and consequently their risk of developing a dry skin condition, such as atopic dermatitis. Extrinsic factors, including the weather and detrimental skin care practices, interact with these genetic changes to determine the severity of the defect and additively increase the risk of developing dry skin conditions. How these dry skin conditions present clinically, and how they persist and progress depends very much on a person's age. Understanding how the skin barrier varies between individuals, how it differs based on clinical presentation, and how it alters with age is important in developing optimum therapies to maintain healthy skin that provides the best protection.",

Current manufacturing procedures necessitate laborious and time-consuming purification procedures to obtain AAV particles of sufficient titer and purity for these demanding biomedical applications. The finding that AAV can be harvested and purified from producer cell medium may represent an efficient alternative to purifying AAV from cellular lysates. Here we sought to determine the maximum duration of time, and frequency within which AAV can be harvested from producer cell medium, in order to maximize the yield obtained from a single transfection preparation. Human embryonic kidney 293T cells were transfected with polyethylenimine to produce AAV2/5 expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP), and cellular medium was harvested every 2 days until a maximum duration of 19 days posttransfection. AAV2/5-GFP was released into producer cell medium at a steady state until 7 days posttransfection, at which time titers dropped dramatically. Harvesting medium every two days resulted in the maximum yield of AAV from a single preparation, and the cumulative yield of AAV harvested from the producer cell medium was 4-fold higher than the yield obtained from a traditional purification of AAV from cellular lysates. The AAV2/5 harvested from medium within the 7-day collection time-course mediated high levels of transduction in vivo, comparable to AAV2/5 harvested from cellular lysates. AAV purified from cell lysates showed increasing amounts of empty particles at 5 and 7 days posttransfection, whereas AAV purified from cell medium did not show an increase in the amount of empty particles throughout the 7-day time course. Finally, we extended these findings to AAV2/9, demonstrating that a comparable ratio of AAV2/9 particles are also released for up to 7 days posttransfection.",

        "abstract": "The anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) fusion oncogene is observed in 3%-5% of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Crizotinib and ceritinib, a next-generation ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) active against crizotinib-refractory patients, are clinically available for the treatment of ALK-rearranged NSCLC patients, and multiple next-generation ALK-TKIs are currently under clinical evaluation. These ALK-TKIs exhibit robust clinical activity in ALK-rearranged NSCLC patients; however, the emergence of ALK-TKI resistance restricts the therapeutic effect. To date, various secondary mutations or bypass pathway activation-mediated resistance have been identified, but large parts of the resistance mechanism are yet to be identified. Here, we report the discovery of p-glycoprotein (P-gp/ABCB1) overexpression as a ceritinib resistance mechanism in ALK-rearranged NSCLC patients. P-gp exported ceritinib and its overexpression conferred ceritinib and crizotinib resistance, but not to PF-06463922 or alectinib, which are next-generation ALK inhibitors. Knockdown of ABCB1 or P-gp inhibitors sensitizes the patient-derived cancer cells to ceritinib, in vitro and in vivo. P-gp overexpression was identified in three out of 11 cases with in ALK-rearranged crizotinib or ceritinib resistant NSCLC patients. Our study suggests that alectinib, PF-06463922, or P-gp inhibitor with ceritinib could overcome the ceritinib or crizotinib resistance mediated by P-gp overexpression.",

Genetic variation in the immune system may predispose to these infections. Nuclear factor-\u03baB is a key component of the TLR-pathway, controlled by inhibitors, encoded by the genes NFKBIA, NFKBIE and NFKBIZ. We aimed to replicate previous findings of genetic variation associated with invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), and to assess whether similar associations could be found in invasive meningococcal disease (IMD).\nMETHODS: Cases with IPD and IMD and controls were identified by linking Danish national registries. DNA was obtained from the Danish Neonatal Screening Biobank. The association between SNPs and susceptibility to IPD and IMD, mortality and pneumococcal serotypes was investigated.\nRESULTS: 372 children with pneumococcal meningitis, 907 with pneumococcal bacteremia and 1273 controls were included. We included 406 cases with meningococcal meningitis, 272 with meningococcal bacteremia, and 672 controls. The NFKBIE SNP was associated with increased risk of pneumococcal meningitis (aOR 1.68; 95% CI: 1.20-2.36), but not bacteremia (aOR 1.08; 95% CI: 0.86-1.35).

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chlamydia is a bacterial infection that has long plagued humanity as the most commonly contracted STD and is caused by Chlamydia trachomatis. With the emergence of HIV/AIDS, sexually transmitted diseases have also re-emerged as a grave public health problem, particularly in developing countries. Updated Information about the relative frequencies in developing countries is sparse. This study aims at establishing the relative occurrence of chlamydia using real time PCR technique in the Vhembe District of South Africa where reports on the prevalence of chlamydia are not available.\nMETHODS: A total of 243 Urine samples were collected from patients attending different ARV clinics in the Vhembe District and genomic DNA was purified using blood genomic DNA kit from Sigma-Aldrich. Real-Time PCR protocol targeting the 16S rRNA gene of C. trachomatis was used to confirm the presence of chlamydia among these patients. Demographic information as well as clinical data was collected as well.\nRESULTS: Of all the participants, 70.4% were females. The age varied from 19 to 72 years. The overall prevalence of chlamydia was 32.1%. The prevalence was significantly higher among females (39.2%) compared to males (15.5%) patients (P = 0.001) and was highest among pregnant women followed by patients who had reported any allergic reaction. Among the HIV positive patients, the prevalence was higher among those who were not taking ARV (38.1%) compared to those who were taking them (28.5%). The age group within which the highest prevalence was found was between 26-45 years.\nCONCLUSIONS: The present study shows a high prevalence of chlamydia among HIV and AIDS patients in the Vhembe District emphasizing the need to enhance STI control and particularly chlamydia among all young people. The particularly high prevalence of chlamydia among pregnant women is of great concern as this predisposes them to complications, while allergy migh predispose people to chlamydia infections. Further studies are needed in the general population both HIV positive and HIV negative persons to further determine the impact of these infections in the community.",

        "abstract": "Initial results by Le and colleagues, which were published in the June 25, 2015 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine, report significant responses of cancers with microsatellite instability (MSI) to anti-PD-1 inhibitors in patients who failed conventional therapy. This finding fits into a broader body of research associating somatic hypermutation and neoepitope formation with response to immunotherapy, with the added benefit of relying on a simple, widely used diagnostic test. This review surveys the pathogenesis and prognostic value of MSI, diagnostic guidelines for detecting it, and the frequency of MSI across tumors, with the goal of providing a reference for its use as a biomarker for PD-1 blockade. MSI usually arises from either germline mutations in components of the mismatch repair (MMR) machinery (MSH2, MSH6, MLH1, PMS2) in patients with Lynch syndrome or somatic hypermethylation of the MLH1 promoter. The result is a cancer with a 10- to 100-fold increase in mutations, associated in the colon with poor differentiation, an intense lymphocytic infiltrate, and a superior prognosis. Diagnostic approaches have evolved since the early 1990s, from relying exclusively on clinical criteria to incorporating pathologic features, PCR-based MSI testing, and immunohistochemistry for loss of MMR component expression. Tumor types can be grouped into categories based on the frequency of MSI, from colorectal (20%) and endometrial (22%-33%) to cervical (8%) and esophageal (7%) to skin and breast cancers (0%-2%). If initial results are validated, MSI testing could have an expanded role as a tool in the armamentarium of precision medicine.",

        "abstract": "The fitness of hybrids might be compromised as a result of intrinsic isolation and/or because they fall between ecological niches due to their intermediate phenotypes (\"extrinsic isolation\"). Here, we present data from several crosses (parental crosses, F1, F2, and backcrosses) between the two host races of Lochmaea capreae on willow and birch to test for extrinsic isolation, intrinsic isolation, and environmentally dependent genetic incompatibilities. We employed a reciprocal transplant design in which offspring were raised on either host plant and their survival was recorded until adulthood. We also applied joint-scaling analysis to determine the genetic architecture of hybrid inviability. The relative fitness of the backcrosses switched between environments; furthermore, the additive genetic-environment interaction was detected as the strongest effect in our analysis. These results provide strong evidence that divergent natural selection has played a central role in the evolution of hybrid dysfunction between host races. Joint-scaling analysis detected significant negative epistatic effects that are most evident in the poor performance of F2-hybrids on willow, indicating signs of intrinsic isolation. We did not find any evidence that genetic incompatibilities are manifested independently of environmental conditions. Our findings suggest the outcome of natural hybridization between these host races is mainly affected by extrinsic isolation and a weak contribution of intrinsic isolation.",

        "abstract": "Dengue is a major worldwide public health problem, especially in the tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Primary infection with a single Dengue virus serotype causes a mild, self-limiting febrile illness called dengue fever. However, a subset of patients who experience secondary infection with a different serotype can progress to a more severe form of the disease, called dengue hemorrhagic fever. The four Dengue virus serotypes (1-4) are antigenically and genetically distinct and each serotype is composed of multiple genotypes. In this study we isolated one Dengue virus 1 serotype, named BR/Alfenas/2012, from a patient with dengue hemorrhagic fever in Alfenas, South Minas Gerais, Brazil and molecular identification was performed based on the analysis of NS5 gene. Swiss mice were infected with this isolate to verify its potential to induce histopathological alterations characteristic of dengue. Liver histopathological analysis of infected animals showed the presence of inflammatory infiltrates, hepatic steatosis, as well as edema, hemorrhage and necrosis focal points. Phylogenetic and evolutionary analyses based on the envelope gene provided evidence that the isolate BR/Alfenas/2012 belongs to genotype V, lineage I and it is probably derived from isolates of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The isolate BR/Alfenas/2012 showed two unique amino acids substitutions (SER222THRE and PHE306SER) when compared to other Brazilian isolates from the same genotype/lineage. Molecular models were generated for the envelope protein indicating that the amino acid alteration PHE 306 SER could contribute to a different folding in this region located within the domain III. Further genetic and animal model studies using BR/Alfenas/2012 and other isolates belonging to the same lineage/genotype could help determine the relation of these genetic alterations and dengue hemorrhagic fever in a susceptible population.",

Model-building tasks were incorporated within case studies and aimed at eliciting students' understanding of 1) the origin of variation in a population and 2) how genes/alleles determine phenotypes. Guided by theory on hierarchical development of systems-thinking skills, we scaffolded instruction and assessment so that students would first focus on articulating isolated relationships between pairs of molecular genetics structures and then integrate these relationships into an explanatory network. We analyzed models students generated on two exams to assess whether students' learning of molecular genetics progressed along the theoretical hierarchical sequence of systems-thinking skills acquisition. With repeated practice, peer discussion, and instructor feedback over the course of the semester, students' models became more accurate, better contextualized, and more meaningful. At the end of the semester, however, more than 25% of students still struggled to describe phenotype as an output of protein function.

While host immunological responses to the lymphocyte-transforming species of Theileria, T. parva and T. annulata, have been well studied, little is known about the immune response to this non-transforming species.\nMETHODS: We developed a recombinant antigen ELISA based on the major piroplasm surface protein (MPSP) of T. orientalis and investigated whether seroconversion to the MPSP was associated with clinical factors (anaemia), parasite burden and parasite genotype. We also examined the dynamics of seroconversion in animals acutely infected with T. orientalis.\nRESULTS: In cattle testing qPCR positive for T. orientalis, seroconversion was more frequent in anaemic compared to normal cattle (P\u2009<\u20090.0001). The ELISA ratio (ER) was highly correlated with total parasite burden as measured by qPCR (r\u2009=\u20090.69; P\u2009<\u20090.0001); however when loads of individual genotypes of the parasite were examined, only the pathogenic Ikeda genotype was highly correlated with ER. Conversely, seroconversion was less frequently detected in the presence of benign T. orientalis genotypes. Temporal measurement of the serological response, parasite burden and packed cell volume (PCV) in acutely infected animals revealed that seroconversion to the MPSP occurs within 2-3 weeks of the initial qPCR detection of the parasite and coincides with a peak in infection intensity and a declining PCV.\nCONCLUSION: Whether the serological response to the MPSP is immunoprotective against re-infection or recrudescence requires further investigation; however the MPSP represents a promising target for a subunit vaccine given that genetic variability within the MPSP results in differential pathogenicity of T. orientalis.",

Whole DNA was isolated from peripheral blood samples after the individuals underwent detailed eye examinations. Eight single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in VEGFR1 genes were genotyped for all individuals using a MALDI-TOF technique. The distribution of genotypes was analyzed for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and the relationships among the genotype and allele frequencies with AMD were evaluated by age-adjusted logistic regression analysis. The measurement of linkage disequilibrium (LD) was carried out by Haploview 4.2. Bonferroni testing was employed to correct for multiple comparisons.\nRESULTS: Among the SNPs genotyped, p values of six SNPs were less than 0.05 between AMD cases and unaffected controls. However, after Bonferroni correction, the genotype and allele distributions of only two SNPs, rs9554322 and rs9582036 differed significantly between the controls and AMD patients. Further, the rs9554322 CC genotype conferred strong susceptibility to AMD (OR = 6.057, 95% CI: 3.099-11.839). Rs9943922 was also found to be significantly associated with AMD in the distributions for the genotype and allele recessive model (p = 0.004).

        "abstract": "Genome or gene editing includes several new techniques to help scientists precisely modify genome sequences. The techniques also enables us to alter the regulation of gene expression patterns in a pre-determined region and facilitates novel insights into the functional genomics of an organism. Emergence of genome editing has brought considerable excitement especially among agricultural scientists because of its simplicity, precision and power as it offers new opportunities to develop improved crop varieties with clear-cut addition of valuable traits or removal of undesirable traits. Research is underway to improve crop varieties with higher yields, strengthen stress tolerance, disease and pest resistance, decrease input costs, and increase nutritional value. Genome editing encompasses a wide variety of tools using either a site-specific recombinase (SSR) or a site-specific nuclease (SSN) system. Both systems require recognition of a known sequence. The SSN system generates single or double strand DNA breaks and activates endogenous DNA repair pathways. SSR technology, such as Cre/loxP and Flp/FRT mediated systems, are able to knockdown or knock-in genes in the genome of eukaryotes, depending on the orientation of the specific sites (loxP, FLP, etc.) flanking the target site. There are 4 main classes of SSN developed to cleave genomic sequences, mega-nucleases (homing endonuclease), zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcriptional activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), and the CRISPR/Cas nuclease system (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat/CRISPR-associated protein). The recombinase mediated genome engineering depends on recombinase (sub-) family and target-site and induces high frequencies of homologous recombination. Improving crops with gene editing provides a range of options: by altering only a few nucleotides from billions found in the genomes of living cells, altering the full allele or by inserting a new gene in a targeted region of the genome. Due to its precision, gene editing is more precise than either conventional crop breeding methods or standard genetic engineering methods. Thus this technology is a very powerful tool that can be used toward securing the world's food supply. In addition to improving the nutritional value of crops, it is the most effective way to produce crops that can resist pests and thrive in tough climates. There are 3 types of modifications produced by genome editing; Type I includes altering a few nucleotides, Type II involves replacing an allele with a pre-existing one and Type III allows for the insertion of new gene(s) in predetermined regions in the genome. Because most genome-editing techniques can leave behind traces of DNA alterations evident in a small number of nucleotides, crops created through gene editing could avoid the stringent regulation procedures commonly associated with GM crop development. For this reason many scientists believe plants improved with the more precise gene editing techniques will be more acceptable to the public than transgenic plants. With genome editing comes the promise of new crops being developed more rapidly with a very low risk of off-target effects. It can be performed in any laboratory with any crop, even those that have complex genomes and are not easily bred using conventional methods.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: De novo reference assemblies that are affordable, practical to produce, and of sufficient quality for most downstream applications, remain an unattained goal for many taxa. Insects, which may yield too little DNA from individual specimens for long-read sequencing library construction and often have highly heterozygous genomes, can be particularly hard to assemble using inexpensive short-read sequencing data. The large number of insect species with medical or economic importance makes this a critical problem to address.\nRESULTS: Using the assembler DISCOVAR de novo, we assembled the genome of the African malaria mosquito Anopheles arabiensis using 250\u00a0bp reads from a single library. The resulting assembly had a contig N50 of 22,433\u00a0bp, and recovered the gene set nearly as well as the ALLPATHS-LG AaraD1 An. arabiensis assembly produced with reads from three sequencing libraries and much greater resources. DISCOVAR de novo appeared to perform better than ALLPATHS-LG in regions of low complexity.\nCONCLUSIONS: DISCOVAR de novo performed well assembling the genome of an insect of medical importance, using simpler sequencing input than previous anopheline assemblies. We have shown that this program is a viable tool for cost-effective assembly of a modestly-sized insect genome.",

Simultaneously, samples diagnosed at MMLs were sent to RIVM for genotyping, aiming to further identify the possible source of the increase.\nMETHODS: Genotyping was performed by sequencing a fragment of the GP60 gene. Additional genotyping was performed on a subset of samples using six microsatellite markers. Population genetic analysis was performed using BEAST.\nRESULTS: The majority of the samples were typed as C. hominis, and a single GP60 genotype (IbA10G2) largely predominated. Genotyping microsatellite markers further supported the circulation of a single genetic type. Population genetic analysis with genotypes found in previous years is inconsistent with a decrease in effective population size.\nCONCLUSIONS: The conclusion of this finding is that the rise reflects more an overall increase and not a common source outbreak.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Decline in physical performance is highly prevalent during aging. Identification of sensitive markers of age-related changes in physical performance is important for early detection, development of therapeutic strategies and insight into underlying mechanisms. We studied the association of calendar age and familial longevity with standard clinical and instrumented measures of physical performance in a cohort of healthy middle-aged to older adults.\nMETHODS: Cross-sectional analysis within the Leiden Longevity Study consisting of offspring of nonagenarian siblings and their partners (n=300, mean age (SD) 65.3 (6.7) years). Standard clinical measures were 25-meter walking speed and total duration of the chair stand test (CST). Instrumented measures were determined using a body fixed sensor. Dependence of physical performance on calendar age and familial longevity (offspring versus partner status) was analyzed using linear and logistic regression, respectively, adjusted for gender and height.\nRESULTS: Higher calendar age was associated with slower walking speed and longer duration of the CST (standardized \u03b2 (95% CI) -.024 (-.042; -.006) and .035 (.014;.056), respectively). Instrumented measures showed similar effect sizes with strongest associations for gait stability and symmetry in mediolateral direction and for the extension and flexion phase of sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit transfers, respectively. No differences were observed between offspring of nonagenarian siblings and their partners.\nCONCLUSIONS: Standard clinical and instrumented measures of physical performance are associated with similar effect size to age-related changes in physical performance observable from middle age. The potential added value of instrumented measures for understanding underlying mechanisms requires further attention.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Recent advances in genomics indicate functional significance of a majority of genome sequences and their long range interactions. As a detailed examination of genome organization and function requires very high quality genome sequence, the objective of this study was to improve reference genome assembly of banana (Musa acuminata).\nRESULTS: We have developed a modular bioinformatics pipeline to improve genome sequence assemblies, which can handle various types of data. The pipeline comprises several semi-automated tools. However, unlike classical automated tools that are based on global parameters, the semi-automated tools proposed an expert mode for a user who can decide on suggested improvements through local compromises. The pipeline was used to improve the draft genome sequence of Musa acuminata. Genotyping by sequencing (GBS) of a segregating population and paired-end sequencing were used to detect and correct scaffold misassemblies. Long insert size paired-end reads identified scaffold junctions and fusions missed by automated assembly methods. GBS markers were used to anchor scaffolds to pseudo-molecules with a new bioinformatics approach that avoids the tedious step of marker ordering during genetic map construction. Furthermore, a genome map was constructed and used to assemble scaffolds into super scaffolds. Finally, a consensus gene annotation was projected on the new assembly from two pre-existing annotations. This approach reduced the total Musa scaffold number from 7513 to 1532 (i.e. by 80%), with an N50 that increased from 1.3 Mb (65 scaffolds) to 3.0 Mb (26 scaffolds). 89.5% of the assembly was anchored to the 11 Musa chromosomes compared to the previous 70%. Unknown sites (N) were reduced from 17.3 to 10.0%.\nCONCLUSION: The release of the Musa acuminata reference genome version 2 provides a platform for detailed analysis of banana genome variation, function and evolution.

The aim of this study was to review a tertiary center experience in treating children with CDH.\nDESIGN: Retrospective observational study from January 2005 to December 2014.\nSETTING: Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) of University Children Hospital (UCH), Belgrade, Serbia.\nPATIENTS: Children with CDH.\nRESULTS: The CDH was diagnosed prenatally in 23% patients. An overall survival rate was 62%. Among those patients who underwent surgical repair 29 (90%) survived. There was statistically significant difference in survival rate between operated patients and total examined population (P=0.020). Prenatally diagnosed neonates with CDH had significantly lower survival rate comparing to those who were postnatally diagnosed (20% vs. 75%; P=0.002). Fatal outcome was more frequent in patients with small birth weight comparing to those with normal birth weight (67% vs. 30%; P=0.046).\nCONCLUSIONS: Our center survival rate for CDH is in accordance with other reported studies. Based on our experience there are potential points for further improvement. First, further increase of prenatal detection, planning for delivery, and coordinated transfer to tertiary institution, in order to avoid transfer of near death patients. Second, preoperative management in the NICU. This could be done by more uniform implementation of current consensual guidelines in monitoring, mechanical ventilation and circulatory support of these delicate patients, together with rationale use of newer therapeutic resources.",

        "abstract": "Id1 is a helix-loop-helix transcriptional modulator that increases the aggressiveness of malignant glial neoplasms. Since most glioblastomas (GBMs) show increased phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI-3K) signaling, we sought to determine whether this pathway regulates Id1 expression. Higher basal Id1 expression correlates with dysregulated PI-3K signaling in multiple established GBM cell lines. Further characterization of PI-3K-dependent Id1 regulation reveals that chemical or genetic inhibition of PI-3K signaling reduces Id1 protein but not mRNA expression. Overall, PI-3K signaling appears to enhance Id1 translation with no significant effect on its stability. PI-3K signaling is known to regulate protein translation through mTORC1-dependent phosphorylation of 4E-BP1, which reduces its association with and inhibition of the translation initiation factor eIF4E. Interestingly, while inhibition of PI-3K and AKT lowers 4E-BP1 phosphorylation and expression of Id1 in all cases, inhibition of TORC1 with rapamycin does not consistently have a similar effect, suggesting an alternative mechanism for PI-3K-dependent regulation of Id1 translation. We now identify a potential role for the serine-threonine phosphatase PPM1G in translational regulation of Id1 protein expression. PPM1G knockdown by siRNA increase both 4E-BP1 phosphorylation and Id1 expression and PPM1G and 4E-BP1 co-associates in GBM cells. Furthermore, PPM1G is a phosphoprotein and this phosphorylation appears to be regulated by PI-3K activity. Finally, PI-3K inhibition increases PPM1G activity when assessed by an in vitro phosphatase assay. Our findings provide the first evidence that the PI-3K/AKT signaling pathway modulates PPM1G activity resulting in a shift in the balance between hyper- and hypo-phosphorylated 4E-BP1 and translational regulation of Id1 expression.",

Based on quantitative PCR (qPCR), our results show a clear seasonal pattern for relative ARGs abundances. The higher ARGs levels in autumn and winter coincide with the higher rates of overall antibiotic prescriptions. While no significant differences of relative abundances were observed before and after the wastewater treatment for most of the relative ARGs, the treatment clearly influenced the microbial community composition and abundance. This indicates that the ARGs are probably not part of the dominant bacterial taxa, which are mainly influenced by the wastewater treatment processes, or that plasmid carrying bacteria remain constant, while plasmid free bacteria decrease. An exception was vancomycin (vanA), showing higher relative abundance in treated wastewater. It is likely that a positive selection or community changes during wastewater treatment lead to an enrichment of vanA. Our results demonstrate that in a medium-term study the combination of qPCR and next generation sequencing corroborated by drug-related health data is a suitable approach to characterize seasonal changes of ARGs in wastewater and treated wastewater.",

Sequences were compared and sliced by BioEdit, and the variations of the human and nonhuman T cell epitopes were analyzed. The rates on synonymous mutation (dS), non-synonymous mutation (dN) and dN/dS values were calculated by Mega 6.0 software.\nRESULTS: Among the 173 strains, there were two non-synonymous mutations in the non-epitope region of glnA1, one non-synonymous mutations in epitope domain of mpt70, one non-synonymous mutation and one synonymous mutation in the epitope domain of lpqH; while groES showed no mutation. lppX had five non-synonymous mutations and one synonymous mutation in the epitope domain. Nine strains presented higher polymorphism at the same gene locus of position 152 in lppX. And seven of the fifteen epitopes contained in lppX were altered and the dN/dS value of this gene was 0.19.\nCONCLUSIONS: Data from the human T cell epitope domains of MTBC antigens Mpt70, LppX and LpqH contained epitope diversity, indicated that these antigens may have involved in diversifying the selection to evade the host immunity. GlnA1 had the polymorphism in epitope domain, which might have little influence on the immuno-response.

Magnessium (Mg) plays an important role in cardiac excitability, vascular tonus, contractibility, reactivity and vasodilatation. In our research, we aimed to study the vasodilatory effect of Mg in the aetiopathogenesis of ectasia.\nMETHODS: Patients identified during routine coronary angiograms in our clinic between January 2010 and 2013 were included in the study. Sixty-two patients with isolated CAE, 57 with normal coronary angiograms (NCA), 73 with severe coronary artery disease (CAD), and 95 with stenosis of at least one coronary artery and CAE (CAD + CAE) were included in the study. Serum Mg levels were measured in mg/dl after 12 hours of fasting.\nRESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences between the groups in terms of age, hypertension, smoking, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes mellitus, family history of coronary artery disease and medications used. Serum glucose, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), urea, total cholesterol, triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, sodium and potassium levels were similar in all groups. Serum Mg levels were 1.90 \u00b1 0.19 mg/dl in patients with isolated CAE, 1.75 \u00b1 0.19 mg/dl in those with CAD, 1.83 \u00b1 0.20 mg/dl in those with CAD + CAE, and 1.80 \u00b1 0.16 mg/dl in the NCA group. These results show that Mg levels were higher in ectasia patients with or without CAD.\nCONCLUSIONS: The histopathological characteristics of patients with CAE were similar to those with CAD. The specific mechanism of abnormal luminal dilatation seen in CAE however remains to be elucidated. Mg is a divalent cation with powerful vasodilatory effects.

No studies, to our knowledge, have investigated the prevalence of monogenic forms of diabetes in preterm infants.\nMETHODS: We studied 750 patients with diabetes diagnosed before 6 months of age. We compared the genetic etiology and clinical characteristics of 146 preterm patients born <37 weeks and compared them with 604 born \u226537 weeks.\nRESULTS: A genetic etiology was found in 97/146 (66%) preterm infants compared with 501/604 (83%) born \u226537weeks, P < .0001. Chromosome 6q24 imprinting abnormalities (27% vs 12%, P = .0001) and GATA6 mutations (9% vs 2%, P = .003) occurred more commonly in preterm than term infants while mutations in KCNJ11 were less common (21 vs 34%, P = .008). Preterm patients with an identified mutation were diagnosed later than those without an identified mutation (median [interquartile range] 35 [34 to 36] weeks vs 31 [28 to 36] weeks, P < .0001). No difference was seen in other clinical characteristics of preterm patients with and without an identified mutation including age of presentation, birth weight, and time to referral.\nCONCLUSIONS: Patients with neonatal diabetes due to a monogenic etiology can be born preterm, especially those with 6q24 abnormalities or GATA6 mutations. A genetic etiology is more likely in patients with less severe prematurity (>32 weeks). Prematurity should not prevent referral for genetic testing as 37% have a potassium channel mutation and as a result can get improved control by replacing insulin with sulphonylurea therapy.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Rodent adult-to-adult heterotopic heart transplantation is a well-established animal model, and the detailed surgical technique with several modifications has been previously described. In immature donor organ transplantation, however, the surgical technique needs to be revised given the smaller size and fragility of the donor graft. Here, we report our surgical technique for heterotopic abdominal (AHTx) and femoral (FHTx) neonatal rat heart transplantation based on an experience of over 300 cases.\nMETHODS: Heterotopic heart transplantation was conducted in syngeneic Lewis rats. Neonatal rats (postnatal day 2-4) served as donors. AHTx was performed by utilizing the conventional adult-to-adult transplant method with specific modifications for optimal aortotomy and venous anastomosis. In the FHTx, the donor heart was vascularized by connecting the donor's aorta and pulmonary artery to the recipient's right femoral artery and vein, respectively, in an end-to-end manner. A specifically fashioned butterfly-shaped rubber sheet was used to align the target vessels properly. The transplanted graft was visually assessed for its viability and was accepted as a technical success when the viability met specific criteria. Successfully transplanted grafts were subject to further postoperative evaluation. Forty cases (AHTx and FHTx; n = 20 each) were compared regarding perioperative parameters and outcomes.\nRESULTS: Both models were technically feasible (success rate: AHTx 75% vs. FHTx 70%) by refining the conventional heterotopic transplant technique. Injury to the fragile donor aorta and congestion of the graft due to suboptimal venous connection were predominant causes of failure, leading to refractory bleeding and poor graft viability. Although the FHTx required significantly longer operation time and graft ischemic time, the in situ graft viabilities were comparable. The FHTx provided better postoperative monitoring as it enabled daily graft palpation and better echocardiographic visualization.\nCONCLUSIONS: We describe detailed surgical techniques for AHTx and FHTx while addressing neonatal donor-specific issues. Following our recommendations potentially reduces the learning curve to achieve reliable and reproducible results with these challenging animal models.",

        "abstract": "Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is the physiologically important target for organophosphorus toxicants (OP) including nerve agents and pesticides. Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) in blood serves as a bioscavenger that protects AChE in nerve synapses from inhibition by OP. Mass spectrometry methods can detect exposure to OP by measuring adducts on the active site serine of plasma BChE. Genetic variants of human AChE and BChE do exist, but loss of function mutations have been identified only in the BCHE gene. The most common AChE variant, His353Asn (H322N), also known as the Yt blood group antigen, has normal AChE activity. The most common BChE variant, Ala567Thr (A539T) or the K-variant in honor of Werner Kalow, has 33% reduced plasma BChE activity. The genetic variant most frequently associated with prolonged response to muscle relaxants, Asp98Gly (D70G) or atypical BChE, has reduced activity and reduced enzyme concentration. Early studies in young, healthy males, performed at a time when it was legal to test nerve agents in humans, showed that individuals responded differently to the same low dose of sarin with toxic symptoms ranging in severity from minimal to moderate. Additionally, animal studies indicated that BChE protects from toxicants that have a higher reactivity with AChE than with BChE (e.g., nerve agents) but not from toxicants that have a higher reactivity with BChE than with AChE (e.g., OP pesticides). As a corollary, we hypothesize that individuals with genetic variants of BChE may be at increased risk of toxicity from nerve agents but not from OP pesticides.",

        "abstract": "AIM: RNA-binding proteins are a large group of regulators (800-1000 in humans), some of which play significant roles in mRNA local translation. In this study, we analyzed the functions of the protein RNP-1, which was previously discovered in a genetic selection screen for nocodazole suppression.\nMETHODS: The growth rates and the microtubule networks of Dictyostelium cells were assessed with or without nocodazole (10 \u03bcmol/L) in suspension culture. Fluorescent images of RNP-1-GFP and RFP-tubulin were captured when cells were undergoing cytokinesis, then the GFP signal intensity and distance to the nearest centrosome were analyzed by using a computer program written in Matlab\u00ae. The RNP-1-GFP-expresseding cells were polarized, and the time-lapse images of cells were captured when cells were chemotaxing to a cAMP source.\nRESULTS: Over-expression of RNP-1 rescued the growth defects caused by the microtubule-destabilizing agent nocodazole. Over-expression of RNP-1 protected microtubules from nocodazole treatment. In cells undergoing cytokinesis, the RNP-1 protein was localized to the polar regions of the cell cortex, and protein levels decreased proportionally as the power of the distance from the cell cortex to the nearest centrosome. In chemotactic cells, the RNP-1 protein localized to the leading edge of moving cells. Sequence analysis revealed that RNP-1 has two RNA-binding domains and is related to cytosolic poly(A)-binding proteins (PABPCs) in humans.\nCONCLUSION: RNP-1 has roles in protecting microtubules and in directing cortical movement during cytokinesis and cell migration in Dictyostelium cells. The sequence similarity of RNP-1 to human PABPCs suggests that PABPCs may have similar functions in mammalian cells, perhaps in regulating microtubule dynamics and functions during cortical movement in cytokinesis and cell migration.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Psychiatry is steadily moving toward a new conceptualization of brain disorders that blurs long-held diagnostic distinctions among neurodevelopmental and psychiatric conditions, including autism. Genomic discoveries are driving these changing perceptions, yet there has so far been minimal impact on traditional genetic counseling practices that continue to view autism through the lens of a dichotomous, all-or-none risk model.\nRECENT FINDINGS: High rates of comorbidity exist across autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, intellectual disability, and other brain-based disorders. Recent epidemiological studies have shown that co-occurrence of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders is the rule, rather than the exception, in affected individuals and within families. Moreover, studies of chromosomal microarray analysis and whole exome sequencing have now detected many of the same pathogenic copy number and sequence-level variants across cohorts with different clinical presentations.\nSUMMARY: Going forward, the genetic counseling field will need to significantly adapt its approaches to pedigree interpretation, variant analysis, and patient education to more precisely describe both the chance and the nature of autism recurrence in terms of a continuum of brain dysfunction. These efforts will have implications for multiple practice areas and require philosophical changes for experienced practitioners and for the training of new genetic counselors. Resetting entrenched dichotomous notions about autism and other brain-based manifestations of genetic conditions will require a strategic educational effort on the part of the genetic counseling profession.",

        "abstract": "Gastric polyps occur in 1-4\u2009% of patients undergoing gastroscopy. Although most are sporadic, some gastric polyps are part of an underlying hereditary syndrome. Gastric polyps can be seen in each of the well-known gastrointestinal polyposis syndromes, but also in Lynch syndrome and in several rare not primarily gastrointestinal syndromes. In addition, Gastric Adenocarcinoma and Proximal Polyposis of the Stomach (GAPPS) is a recently described heritable syndrome characterized by isolated gastric polyposis and risk of gastric cancer.Some of these syndromes are associated with an increased risk of gastric cancer, whereas others are not. However, the neoplastic potential and the precursor status of these gastric polyps are not always clear, even in syndromes with a well-established risk of gastric cancer. For instance, the neoplastic potential of Peutz-Jeghers polyps is debatable, despite the well-established risk of gastric cancer in this syndrome. Also fundic gland polyps and gastric foveolar-type adenomas in FAP carry a low risk of malignant transformation. In contrast, gastric juvenile polyps are precursor lesions of gastric cancer in juvenile polyposis syndrome through neoplastic progression of juvenile polyps in these patients.Although these hereditary syndromes with gastric polyps are rare, recognition is important for individual patient management. Furthermore, the initiation and progression of these lesions can be influenced by environmental factors such as Helicobacter Pylori infection. This makes these rare lesions an appropriate model for understanding the clonal evolution of early gastric cancer in the wider population.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Fabry disease (FD) is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by enzyme \u03b1 galactosidase A (\u03b1-Gal A) deficiency due to mutations in the galactosidase alpha (GLA) gene. It leads to damage several organs, such as the kidneys, due to progressive accumulation of glycosphingolipids.\nOBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of FD among male hemodialysis (HD) patients in a northern state of Brazil.\nMETHODS: Screening was performed using a dried blood spot on filter paper to identify patients with low \u03b1-Gal A enzyme activity (\u22642.2 \u00b5mol/l/h). Those with low enzyme activity underwent genetic analysis of the GLA gene. Family screening was conducted in the index cases.\nRESULTS: 2,583 male HD patients (age: 52 (18-91 years)) were screened. The \u03b1-Gal A assay identified 72 males (2.78%) with low enzyme activity. Genotyping identified 3 patients with GLA mutations: W204X, A368T, both previously reported; and C52F, a novel missense mutation. Only the patient with W204X mutation had classic FD. The prevalence rate was 0.12%. Family screening of the index cases identified 23 family members with the same mutations.\nCONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of FD amongst male HD patients found in the Northern of Brazil was low (0.12%). However, family screening of the 3 index cases identified family members at an early stage of the disease, which may benefit from earlier treatment.",

However, it has not been directly shown that hepatocellular genetic ablation of either this receptor tyrosine kinase or ERBB3, its interactive signaling partner, affects hepatic fibrosis. Carbon tetrachloride (CCl<sub>4</sub>)-induced liver fibrosis in hepatocyte-specific (HS) mouse models of EGFR and ERBB3 ablation was evaluated in both single gene knockouts and an HS-EGFR-ERBB3 double knockout (DKO). Loss of hepatocellular EGFR or ERBB3 did not impact cytochrome P450-2E1 expression, the extent of centrilobular injury, or the initial regenerative response, but it did diminish liver fibrosis induced by chronic intraperitoneal administration of CCl<sub>4</sub> The reduction of liver fibrosis correlated with reduced \u03b1-smooth muscle actin expression. Maximal impact to fibrogenesis occurred in the ERBB3 and EGFR-ERBB3 DKO models, suggesting that EGFR-ERBB3 heterodimeric signaling in damaged hepatocytes may play a more important role in liver fibrosis than EGFR-EGFR homodimeric signaling. Immunohistochemical analyses of phospho-EGFR and phospho-ERBB3 isoforms revealed clear staining in hepatocytes, activated stellate cells, and macrophages. Our results support a role for the hepatocellular ERBB tyrosine kinases in fibrogenesis and suggest that pharmacologic inhibition of EGFR-ERBB3 signaling may reverse or retard hepatic fibrosis.",

Asthma prevalence has dramatically increased over the last decade in Westernized societies, thereby suggesting a key function of environmental factors in disease promotion and development.\nRECENT FINDINGS: 'Early-life' microbial exposure and bacterial colonization are crucial for the maturation and the education of the immune system. The commensal flora is also critical in order to maintain immune homeostasis at the mucosal surfaces and may consequently play an important function in allergic disease development. Recent evidence demonstrates that asthma influences and is also impacted by the composition and function of the human intestinal and respiratory microbiome.\nSUMMARY: In this review, we summarize the most recent findings on how asthma development is connected with respiratory and intestinal microbial dysbiosis. We highlight and discuss recent research that reveals the existence of a 'gut-lung' microbial axis and its impact on asthma development. We also analyze how 'early-life' microbial exposure affects the immune response and the consequences for asthma development.",

        "abstract": "Pompe disease, caused by deficiency of acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA), leads to widespread glycogen accumulation and profound neuromuscular impairments. There has been controversy, however, regarding the role of central nervous system pathology in Pompe motor dysfunction. We hypothesized that absence of GAA protein causes progressive activation of neuropathological signaling, including pathways associated with cell death. To test this hypothesis, genomic data (Affymetrix Mouse Gene Array 2.0ST) from the midcervical spinal cord in 6 and 16 mo old Pompe (Gaa-/-) mice were evaluated (Broad Institute Molecular Signature Database), along with spinal cord histology. The midcervical cord was selected because it contains phrenic motoneurons, and phrenic-diaphragm dysfunction is prominent in Pompe disease. Several clinically important themes for the neurologic etiology of Pompe disease emerged from this unbiased genomic assessment. First, pathways associated with cell death were strongly upregulated as Gaa-/- mice aged, and motoneuron apoptosis was histologically verified. Second, proinflammatory signaling was dramatically upregulated in the Gaa-/- spinal cord. Third, many signal transduction pathways in the Gaa-/- cervical cord were altered in a manner suggestive of impaired synaptic function. Notably, glutamatergic signaling pathways were downregulated, as were \"synaptic plasticity pathways\" including genes related to neuroplasticity. Fourth, many genes and pathways related to cellular metabolism are dysregulated. Collectively, the data unequivocally confirm that systemic absence of GAA induces a complex neuropathological cascade in the spinal cord. Most importantly, the results indicate that Pompe is a neurodegenerative condition, and this underscores the need for early therapeutic intervention capable of targeting the central nervous system.",

As a result of subsequent natural and artificial selection, hundreds of different breeds have evolved, displaying a broad range of phenotypic traits. Here, 10 Eurasian B.\u00a0taurus breeds from different biogeographic and production conditions, which exhibit different demographic histories and have been under artificial selection at various intensities, were investigated using the Illumina BovineSNP50 panel to understand their genetic diversity and population structure. In addition, we scanned genomes from eight breeds for signatures of diversifying selection. Our population structure analysis indicated six distinct breed groups, the most divergent being the Yakutian cattle from Siberia. Selection signals were shared (experimental P-value < 0.01) with more than four breeds on chromosomes 6, 7, 13, 16 and 22. The strongest selection signals in the Yakutian cattle were found on chromosomes 7 and 21, where a miRNA gene and genes related to immune system processes are respectively located. In general, genomic regions indicating selection overlapped with known QTL associated with milk production (e.g. on chromosome 19), reproduction (e.g. on chromosome 24) and meat quality (e.g. on chromosome 7).

To facilitate genome annotation efforts for prokaryotes, we developed an open source software called GAPP for genome annotation and global profiling of post-translational modifications (PTMs) in prokaryotes. With a single command, it provides a standard workflow to validate and refine predicted genetic models and discover diverse PTM events. We demonstrated the utility of GAPP using proteomic data from Helicobacter pylori, one of the major human pathogens that is responsible for many gastric diseases. Our results confirmed 84.9% of the existing predicted H. pylori proteins, identified 20 novel protein coding genes, and corrected four existing gene models with regard to translation initiation sites. In particular, GAPP revealed a large repertoire of PTMs using the same proteomic data and provided a rich resource that can be used to examine the functions of reversible modifications in this human pathogen. This software is a powerful tool for genome annotation and global discovery of PTMs and is applicable to any sequenced prokaryotic organism; we expect that it will become an integral part of ongoing genome annotation efforts for prokaryotes.

        "abstract": "Markerless gene deletion is necessary for multiple gene disruptions due to the limited number of antibiotic resistant markers for some bacteria. However, even in transformable strains, obtaining the expected mutation without a marker requires laborious screening of a large number of colonies. Previous studies had success in various bacteria with a counter-selection system where a conditional lethal gene was incorporated into the vector. We examined the efficacy of the mutated pheS gene (pheS*) as a counter-selective marker for gene deletion in Bacteroides. This mutation produces an amino acid substitution (A303G) in the alpha subunit of Bacteroides phenylalanyl tRNA synthetase, which in E.\u00a0coli alters the specificity of the tRNA synthetase resulting in a conditional lethal mutation due to the incorporation of p-chloro-phenylalanine (p-Cl-Phe) into protein. B.\u00a0fragilis YCH46 and B.\u00a0thetaiotaomicron VPI-5482 transformed with a pheS*-harboring shuttle vector were clearly growth-inhibited in the presence of &gt;5\u00a0mM p-Cl-Phe in liquid defined minimal media (DMM) and on DMM agar plates. A targeting plasmid was constructed to delete the genetic region for capsular polysaccharide PS2 in B.\u00a0fragilis or PS1 in B.\u00a0thetaiotaomicron. After counterselection, p-Cl-Phe-resistant colonies were generated at a frequency of 8.1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010-3 for B.\u00a0fragilis and 1.7\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010-3 for B.\u00a0thetaiotaomicron. Of the p-Cl-Phe-resistant colonies, 4.2% and 72% harbored the correct genetic deletion for B.\u00a0fragilis and B.\u00a0thetaiotaomicron, respectively.

Three areas need to be addressed: predictions concerning potential genetic alterations, predictions and implications concerning the release of genetically altered pathogens, and the short- and long-term implications of the release of genetically altered pathogens. Full discourse on these topics among professionals in the area of public health will help to combat harm from the use of any genetically altered biologic weapons. The topics covered here include a review of the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technique, including a discussion of which possibilities utilize genome editing. We then address predictions about the application of gene alterations in the context of bioweapons.

The BET protein inhibition suppresses osteoclast differentiation and activity as well as the osteoblastogenesis in vitro. Moreover, we show that treated non-resorbing osteoclasts could still activate osteoblast differentiation. In addition, specific inhibition of BRD4 using RNA interference inhibits osteoclast differentiation but strongly activates osteoblast mineralization activity. Mechanistically, JQ1 inhibits expression of the master osteoclast transcription factor NFATc1 and the transcription factor of osteoblast Runx2.

Family and personal history of colorectal cancer (CRC) were recorded, together with genetic (microsatellite instability), immunohistochemical and clinical variables.\nRESULTS: Forty-eight (10.6%) of 451 patients were classified as FCCTX and the remaining 403 (89.4%) as S-CRC. Age at the diagnosis of tumour was significantly lower in FCCTX than in S-CRC (64.06\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012.65\u00a0years vs 69.13\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010.80 years; P\u00a0=\u00a00.01; Z\u00a0=\u00a0-2.48).

Survival correlated significantly with the number of first-degree and second-degree relatives with CRC (P\u00a0=\u00a00.04; OR:\u00a01.368, 95% CI: 1.01-1.84, and P\u00a0=\u00a00.04; OR:\u00a01.363, 95% CI: 1.08-1.65) and with the total number of cases of CRC in the immediate family (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01; OR:\u00a01.377, 95% CI: 1.17-1.61). Recurrence-free time was significantly lower in patients with FCCTX (log-rank\u00a0=\u00a00.01).\nCONCLUSION: Significant differences were found in several demographic and clinicopathological variables between patients with FCCTX and patients with S-CRC.

        "abstract": "Approximately 4% of sudden cardiac deaths are unexplained [the sudden arrhythmic death syndrome (SADS)], and up to 6-10% of survivors of cardiac arrest do not have an identifiable cardiac abnormality after comprehensive clinical evaluation [idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (IVF)]. Genetic testing may be able to play a role in diagnostics and can be targeted to an underlying phenotype present in family members following clinical evaluation. Alternatively, post-mortem genetic testing (the \"molecular autopsy\") may diagnose the underlying cause if a clearly pathogenic rare variant is found. Limitations include a modest yield, and the high probability of finding a variant of unknown significance (VUS) leading to a low signal-to-noise ratio. Next generation sequencing enables cost-efficient high throughput screening of a larger number of genes but at the expense of increased genetic noise. The yield from genetic testing is even lower in IVF in the absence of any suggestion of another phenotype in the index case or his/her family, and should be actively discouraged at this time. Future improvements in diagnostic utility include optimization of the use of variant-calling pipelines and shared databases as well as patient-specific models of disease to more accurately assign pathogenicity of variants. Studying \"trios\" of parents and the index case may better assess the yield of sporadic and recessive disease.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND AIMS: Aberrant production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and its impact on the integrity of genomic DNA have been considered one of the major risk factors for the loss of dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease (PD). Stem cell transplantation as a strategy to replenish new functional neurons has great potential for PD treatment. However, limited survival of stem cells post-transplantation has always been an obstacle ascribed to the existence of neurotoxic environment in PD patients.\nMETHODS: To improve the survival of transplanted stem cells for PD treatment, we explored a new strategy based on the function of the H2AX gene (H2A histone family, member X) in determination of DNA repair and cell apoptosis. We introduced a mutant form Y142F of H2AX into dopamine (DA) neuron-like cells differentiated from bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (BMSCs).\nRESULTS: Expression of H2AX(Y142F) renders DA neuron-like cells more resistant to DNA damage and subsequent cell death induced by ultraviolet irradiation and 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) treatment.\nDISCUSSION: This is a meaningful attempt to improve the sustainability of BMSC-derived dopamine neurons under a brain neurotoxic environment. Further studies are needed to evaluate the implications of our findings in stem cell therapy for PD and related diseases.",

A recent study revealed that in colon cancer, bacteria form polysaccharide matrices called biofilms at a high frequency in the proximal colon. Comprehensive untargeted and stable isotope-assisted metabolomic analysis revealed that the bacteria utilize polyamine metabolites produced from colon adenomas/carcinomas to build these protective biofilms and may contribute to inflammation and proliferation observed in colon cancer. This study highlighted the importance of finding the biological origin of a metabolite and assessing its metabolism and mechanism of action. This led to a better understanding of host and microbial interactions, thereby aiding therapeutic design for cancer.

        "abstract": "Neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus is sensitive to endogenous and exogenous factors that influence hippocampal function. Ongoing neurogenesis and the integration of these new neurons throughout life thus may provide a sensitive indicator of environmental stress. We examined the effects of Aroclor 1254 (A1254), a mixture of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), on the development and function of newly generated dentate granule cells. Early exposure to A1254 has been associated with learning impairment in children, suggesting potential impact on the development of hippocampus and/or cortical circuits. Oral A1254 (from the 6th day of gestation to postnatal day 21) produced the expected increase in PCB levels in brain at postnatal day 21, which persisted at lower levels into adulthood. A1254 did not affect the proliferation or survival of newborn neurons in immature animals nor did it cause overt changes in neuronal morphology. However, A1254 occluded the normal developmental increase in sEPSC frequency in the third post-mitotic week without altering the average sEPSC amplitude. Our results suggest that early exposure to PCBs can disrupt excitatory synaptic function during a period of active synaptogenesis, and thus could contribute to the cognitive effects noted in children exposed to PCBs.",

The LORIS (surgery versus active monitoring for low-risk DCIS) trial is studying the safety of monitoring low-risk DCIS, although ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) rates in patients meeting enrollment criteria after complete surgical excision are unknown.\nMETHODS: Women with pure DCIS treated with breast-conserving surgery (BCS) with/without radiation therapy (RT) from 1/1996-1/2011 were included from a prospectively maintained database. IBTR rates were compared between those who did and did not meet LORIS eligibility criteria (age\u00a0\u2265\u00a046\u00a0years, screen-detected calcifications, nipple discharge absence, minimal family history, non-high-grade DCIS) after complete surgical excision.\nRESULTS: A total of 2394 women were identified; 401 met LORIS criteria. Median follow-up was 5.9\u00a0years; 431 had \u226510\u00a0years follow-up. LORIS cohort median age was 61\u00a0years (range 46-86\u00a0years); 207 (52\u00a0%) underwent RT, 79 (20\u00a0%) received endocrine therapy. Of 401 patients, 24 experienced an IBTR. Overall 10-year IBTR rates were 10.3\u00a0% (LORIS) versus 15.4\u00a0% (non-LORIS) (p\u00a0=\u00a00.08); without RT, 12.1 versus 21.4\u00a0%, respectively (p\u00a0=\u00a00.06). The 10-year invasive-IBTR rates for women meeting LORIS criteria were: 5.3\u00a0% BCS overall, 6.0\u00a0% without RT.\nCONCLUSIONS: Women meeting LORIS criteria (after complete surgical excision) are at somewhat lower risk for IBTR. Among such women undergoing excision without RT, the 10-year invasive-IBTR rate was 6\u00a0%. Given that approximately 20\u00a0% of women with core biopsy-proven non-high-grade DCIS have invasive cancer at excision, women managed without excision would be expected to incur higher invasive cancer rates. Additional criteria are needed to identify women not requiring intervention for DCIS.",

Here we show that additional combinations of mutations can turn Arabidopsis meiosis into mitosis and that a combination of three mutations in rice (Oryza sativa) efficiently turns meiosis into mitosis, leading to the production of male and female clonal diploid gametes in this major crop.

Here, we investigated the relationship between serum cardiac biomarkers with clinical parameters in DM patients.\nMETHODS: Case-control study included 59 DM patients and 22 healthy controls. An additional group of 62 controls with similar cardiac defects to DM were enrolled.\nRESULTS: NT-proBNP, hs-cTnT and CK levels were significantly increased in DM patients compared to healthy subjects (p=0.0008, p<0.0001, p<0.0001). Also, hs-cTnT levels were significantly higher in DM compared to control group with cardiac defects (p=0.0003). Positive correlation was found between hs-cTnT and hs-cTnI in both DM patients and controls (p=0.019, p=0.002). Independently from the age, the risk of DM disease was positively related to an increase in hs-cTnT (p=0.03). On the contrary, the risk of DM was not related to hs-cTnI, but was evidenced a role of PR interval (p=0.03) and CK (p=0.08).\nCONCLUSIONS: The levels of hs-cTnT were significantly higher in DM patients. Analysis, with anti-cTnT, shows that this increase might be linked to heart problems.

A systematic review of the scientific literature was performed using the Medline database (National Library of Medicine, PubMed) using the following keywords: epidemiology, risk factor, AA, Balkan nephropathy (BNe), LS, hereditary cancer, hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), mismatch repair genes, urothelial carcinomas, upper urinary tract, renal pelvis, ureter, Amsterdam criteria, genetic counselling, mismatch repair genes, genetic instability, microsatellite, and Bethesda guidelines. LS is a specific risk for UTUC, which is the third most frequent cancer (in its tumor spectrum) after colon and uterine lesions. Mutation of the MSH2 gene is the most commonly described cause of UTUC in LS. Diagnosis is based on clinical suspicion and is guided by Bethesda and Amsterdam criteria. It is secondarily confirmed by immunohistochemical analyses of the tumor and a search for gene mutations. The presence of LS in patients with UTUC is a favorable prognosis factor for survival during follow-ups. AA is a specific environmental risk factor for UTUC and tubulo-interstitial nephropathy. It has been involved in the development of nephropathies in link with the Balkan disease and intake of Chinese herbal medicine. More broadly, the use of traditional plant medicines from the genus Aristolochia has created worldwide public-health concerns. UTUCs share common risk factors with other urothelial carcinomas such as tobacco or occupational exposure. However, these tumors have also specific risk factors such as AA exposure and LS that clinicians should be aware of because of their clinical implication in further management and follow-up.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The presence of the Thr92Ala polymorphism of deiodinase-2 (D2) has been thought to have several effects. It may influence its enzymatic function, is associated with increased expression of genes involved in oxidative stress in brain tissue, and may predict favorable response to combination levothyroxine (LT4) plus triiodothyronine (T3) therapy. It was hypothesized that homozygous carriers of the D2-92Ala allele have different thyroid hormone parameters, and reduced health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and cognitive functioning.\nMETHODS: In 12,625 participants from the LifeLines cohort study with genome-wide genetic data available, the effects of the Thr92Ala polymorphism (rs225014) were evaluated in the general population and in 364 people treated with thyroid hormone replacement therapy, the latter mainly because of primary hypothyroidism. In addition to evaluating anthropometric data, medication use, and existence of metabolic syndrome, HRQoL was assessed with the RAND 36-Item Health Survey, and the Ruff Figural Fluency Test was used as a sensitive test for executive functioning. Data on thyrotropin, free thyroxine (fT4), and free T3 (fT3) levels were available in a subset of 4479 participants.\nRESULTS: The mean age (\u00b1standard deviation) was 53\u2009\u00b1\u200912 years and the body mass index was 27.0\u2009\u00b1\u20094.5\u2009kg/m2 in the LT4 users compared with 48\u2009\u00b1\u200911 years and 26.2\u2009\u00b1\u20094.1\u2009kg/m2 in participants from the general population. The Ala/Ala genotype of the D2-Thr92Ala polymorphism was present in 11.3% of LT4 users and in 10.7% of the general population. In total, 3742/4479 subjects with thyroid hormone data available had normal TSH (0.4-4.0\u2009mIU/L), and 88% of LT4 users were females. LT4 users had higher fT4, lower fT3, and a lower fT3/fT4 ratio, and female patients had lower scores on the HRQoL domains of physical functioning, vitality, mental health, social functioning, bodily pain, and general health compared with those not using LT4 (p\u2009&lt;\u20090.005). Executive functioning scores, as part of cognitive functioning, were comparable between female LT4 users and the general population. In both groups, the D2-Thr92Ala polymorphism was not associated with differences in TSH, fT4, fT3, the fT3/fT4 ratio, presence of metabolic syndrome or other comorbidities, use of medication, HRQoL, and cognitive functioning.\nCONCLUSION: The Thr92Ala polymorphism of D2 was not associated with thyroid parameters, HRQoL, and cognitive functioning in the general population and in participants on thyroid hormone replacement therapy.",

Analysis was carried out within 1.0min over a concentration range of 6.25-200.00ng/mL for the studied analytes. Validation was carried out according to FDA guidelines for bioanalytical method validation and satisfactory results were obtained.

The expression of iNOS and COX-2 in cultured VSMCs isolated from 6-7-week-old stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) is significantly lower than in cells of normotensive Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY). These reductions are also found in cells exposed to pulsatile atmospheric pressure between 80-160 mmHg at a rate of 4 cycles/min, which simulates systolic hypertension. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid, potentiates IL-1\u03b2-induced iNOS and COX-2 expression in VSMCs isolated from WKY, but not those from SHRSP. In response to endothelial injury at a local site, iNOS and COX-2 induction in VSMCs may function primarily as a defensive and compensatory mechanism for endothelial dysfunction by preventing the development of pathological conditions. Thus, in certain pathological conditions associated with hypertension, vascular walls with reduced iNOS and COX-2 expression may aggravate or initiate further vascular injury. In this situation, DHA may contribute to maintaining homeostasis in VSMCs by potentiating iNOS and COX-2 expression. Using cells isolated from a genetic pathological animal model alongside cells exposed to experimental pathological conditions can be an effective tool for the analysis of cell response to hypertension and exploring pharmacological modes of action in vitro.",

In 2012, there were 1.4 million estimated cases of colorectal cancer worldwide, and 700,000 estimated deaths, which implies significant impact on public health, especially in economically-developed countries. In recent years, there has been an increase in the number of tumors, although this has been accompanied by decreased mortality, due to more appropriate and available information, earlier diagnosis, and improvements in treatment. Colorectal cancers are characterized by great genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity, including tumor microenvironment and interactions between healthy and cancer cells. All of these traits confer a unique peculiarity to each tumor, which can thus be considered as an individual disease. Well conducted molecular and clinical characterization of each colorectal cancer is essential with a view to the implementation of precision oncology, and thus personalized care. This last aims at standardization of therapeutic plans chosen according to the genetic background of each specific neoplasm, to increase overall survival and reduce treatment side effects. Thus, prognostic and predictive molecular biomarkers assume a critical role in the characterization of colorectal cancer and in the determination of the most appropriate therapy.",

Intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) for women at risk of transmitting GBS to their newborns has been effective in reducing, but not eliminating, the young infant GBS disease burden in many high income countries. However, identification of women at risk and administration of IAP is very difficult in many low and middle income country (LMIC) settings, and is not possible for home deliveries. Immunization of pregnant women with a GBS vaccine represents an alternate pathway to protecting newborns from GBS disease, through the transplacental antibody transfer to the fetus in utero. This approach to prevent GBS disease in young infants is currently under development, and is approaching late stage clinical evaluation. This manuscript includes a review of the natural history of the disease, global disease burden estimates, diagnosis and existing control options in different settings, the biological rationale for a vaccine including previous supportive studies, analysis of current candidates in development, possible correlates of protection and current status of immunogenicity assays.

Significant predictors were age at discharge for immunization and steroid use for nonimmunization.\nIMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Immunization needs to be a priority in order to give NICU infants every advantage regarding their future health status. Nurses need to implement hospital policies ensuring immunizations of NICU graduates.\nIMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH: Future studies should focus on samples from diverse hospitals and levels of NICUs. Qualitative studies exploring and describing parent and provider knowledge of current AAP guidelines will strengthen our understanding of potential barriers to immunization.",

        "abstract": "The pathophysiologic continuum of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease begins with steatosis. Despite recent advances in our understanding of the gene regulatory program directing steatosis, how it is orchestrated at the chromatin level is unclear. PPAR\u03b32 is a hepatic steatotic transcription factor induced by overnutrition. Here, we report that the histone H3 lysine 4 methyltransferase MLL4/KMT2D directs overnutrition-induced murine steatosis via its coactivator function for PPAR\u03b32. We demonstrate that overnutrition facilitates the recruitment of MLL4 to steatotic target genes of PPAR\u03b32 and their transactivation via H3 lysine 4 methylation because PPAR\u03b32 phosphorylated by overnutrition-activated ABL1 kinase shows enhanced interaction with MLL4. We further show that Pparg2 (encoding PPAR\u03b32) is also a hepatic target gene of ABL1-PPAR\u03b32-MLL4. Consistently, inhibition of ABL1 improves the fatty liver condition of mice with overnutrition by suppressing the pro-steatotic action of MLL4. Our results uncover a murine hepatic steatosis regulatory axis consisting of ABL1-PPAR\u03b32-MLL4, which may serve as a target of anti-steatosis drug development.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To explore the clinical features and pathogenic gene mutation of juvenile nephronophthisis (NPHP) in Chinese patients. Method: Clinical data and blood samples of 27 juvenile NPHP patients from 25 families who were initially clinically diagnosed in six hospitals in Guangdong province were collected. NPHP1 homozygous deletions were detected in all patients. Sequencing of NPHP1 gene was performed when homozygous deletions were not found in patients without eye involvement. In patients with eye involvement, NPHP5 sequencing was carried out initially and subsequently NPHP10 gene and NPHP1 when there were no NPHP5 gene mutation found. Result: Diagnosis was confirmed in 13 patients by renal pathology and (or) gene sequencing, including four boys and nine girls with a median onset age of 8.5(0.1-12.8) years. Seven of the 13 patients had a normal routine urine test and six patients had mild to moderate proteinuria. None had persistent hematuria. The estimated glomerular filtration rate of the 13 patients was (12.7\u00b110.7) ml/(min\u00b71.73 m2) at the time of diagnosis. Renal cysts were found in only five patients by iconography. Decreased renal size was observed in nine cases and normal renal size in four patients. Renal pathology was available in five patients, renal cysts formation at the cortical-medullar area, thickening and laying tubular basement membrane, were observed. Two of the thirteen children had eye involvement, one had liver impairment and one had growth retardation. NPHP1 gene defects were detected in seven patients with a mutation rate of 25.9%, and large homozygous deletions were observed in three patients. Four patients had single point mutations, i. e. compound heterozygous mutations (c.13 C&gt;T and c. 1520+ 5 G&gt;A) in one patient; homozygous mutation in three patients, two patients were siblings from the same pedigree harbored c. 1756 C&gt;T and the other one harbored c. 1298delA. NPHP5 gene homozygous mutation was found in one pedigree. The fourteen children without renal pathology and whose genetic tests were negative shared similar clinical features with the thirteen patients whose diagnosis were confirmed by gene mutation and (or) renal pathology. Conclusion: The onset of juvenile NPHP is insidious. Urine and renal iconography changes are mild or negative. The ratio of NPHP1 mutant patient is similar with previous reports, but the proportion of NPHP1 gene homozygous deletions is much lower and all of the NPHP1 gene single point mutations detected in this research were novel, which indicates a genetic discrepancy existed between Chinese NPHP patients and the western ones.",

Method: The clinical presentation, laboratory investigations and management of a case with infantile cholestasis caused by CFTR mutations were summarized and the relevant literature was reviewed. Result: (1) The patient was a 5 months old boy with cholestasis which developed in neonatal period with delayed meconium exclusion.The laparoscopic exploration was performed to exclude biliary atresia because of acholic stool when he was two months old.Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), cholestyramine and phenobarbital treatment was applied.The genetic analysis showed compound heterozygous mutations in CFTR. The liver function normalized when he was 11 months old.When he was 21 months old, he had normal appearance except mild splenomegaly.(2) Literatures review identified 25 infantile cholestatic cases related to cystic fibrosis (CF) diagnosed by sweat test or gene analysis.Delayed meconium passage was found in five, meconium ileus in six cases.The liver function tests characterized by the direct hyperbilirubinemia with elevated transaminase, glutamyltranspeptidase and alkaline phosphatase levels.Genetic analysis revealed eight homozygotes of delF508, four heterozygotes of delF508 and one compound heterozygotes of c. 263T&gt;G/ c. 2089-2090ins in CFTR.Jaundice resolved in 20 patients, ten of them were prescribed oral ursodesoxycholic acid (15-20 mg/(kg\u00b7d)). Five patients died, none of them received oral UDCA.Two of them had persisted cholestatic until death. Among the other three dead, two died from respiratory failure and one from cardiopulmonary failure. Conclusion: Cystic fibrosis should be considered in cholestatic infants with meconium ileus or delayed meconium passage.Genetic analysis could confirm the diagnosis.UDCA may be beneficial to improve the liver function.",

        "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Feeding behavior is orchestrated by neural circuits primarily residing in the hypothalamus and hindbrain. However, the relative influence of cognitive and emotional brain circuits to the feeding circuitry in the hypothalamus and hindbrain remains unclear. Here, using the cell-type selectivity of genetic methods, circuit mapping, and behavior assays, we sought to decipher neural circuits emanating from the septal nucleus to the lateral hypothalamus (LH) that contribute to neural regulation of food intake in mice. We found that chemogenetic and optogenetic activation of septal vesicular GABA transporter (vGAT)-containing neurons or their projections in the LH reduced food intake in mice. Consistently, chemogenetic inhibition of septal vGAT neurons increased food intake. Furthermore, we investigated a previously unknown neural circuit originating from septal vGAT neurons to a subset of vGAT neurons in the LH, an area involved in homeostatic and hedonic control of energy states. Collectively, our data reveal an inhibitory septohypothalamic feeding circuit that might serve as a therapeutic target for the treatment of eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa.\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Our results demonstrate that top-down projections from the septum to the hypothalamus control food intake negatively. Given the known role for both of these brain regions in the control of feeding and emotion-related behaviors, these findings reveal previously unknown neural circuitry that is likely implicated in emotional aspects of food intake and provide new insights into the development of therapeutic targets for the treatment of eating disorders.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Clinicians are advised to refer patients with lower gastrointestinal (GI) alarm features for urgent colonoscopy to exclude colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the utility of alarm features is debated.\nAIM: To assess whether performance of alarm features is improved by using a symptom frequency threshold to trigger referral, or by combining them into composite variables, including minimum age thresholds, as recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).\nMETHODS: We collected data prospectively from 1981 consecutive adults with lower GI symptoms. Assessors were blinded to symptom status. The reference standard to define CRC was histopathological confirmation of adenocarcinoma in biopsy specimens from a malignant-looking colorectal lesion. Controls were patients without CRC. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values (PPVs) and negative predictive values were calculated for individual alarm features, as well as combinations of these.\nRESULTS: In identifying 47 (2.4%) patients with CRC, individual alarm features had sensitivities ranging from 11.1% (family history of CRC) to 66.0% (loose stools), and specificities from 30.5% (loose stools) to 75.6% (family history of CRC). Using higher symptom frequency thresholds improved specificity, but to the detriment of sensitivity. NICE referral criteria also had higher specificities and lower sensitivity, with PPVs above 4.8%. More than 80% of those with CRC met at least one of the NICE referral criteria.\nCONCLUSIONS: Using higher symptom frequency thresholds for alarm features improved specificity, but sensitivity was low. NICE referral criteria had PPVs above 4.8%, but sensitivities ranged from 2.2% to 32.6%, meaning many cancers would be missed.",

        "abstract": "Carotenoid cleavage oxygenases (CCOs) are a family of dioxygenases, which specifically catalyze the cleavage of conjugated double bonds in carotenoids and apocarotenoids in plants. In this study, genome-wide analysis of CCO genes in pepper plants was performed using bioinformatic methods. At least 11 members of the CCO gene family were identified in the pepper genome. Phylogenetic analysis showed that pepper and tomato CCO genes could be divided into two groups (CCDs and NCEDs). The CCD group included five sub-groups (CCD1, CCD4, CCD7, CCD8, and CCD-like). These results indicate that there is a close genetic relationship between the two species. Sequence analysis using the online tool, Multiple Expectation Maximization for Motif Elicitation (MEME), showed that the CCO proteins comprise multiple conserved motifs, with 20 to 41 amino acids. In addition, multiple cis-acting elements in the promoter of CCO genes were identified using the online tool PlantCARE, and were found to be involved in light responsiveness, plant hormone regulation, and biotic and abiotic stresses, suggesting potential roles of these proteins under different conditions. RNA-seq analysis revealed that the CCO genes exhibit distinct patterns of expression in the roots, stems, leaves, and fruit. These findings suggest that the CCO genes have important roles in the vegetative and reproductive development of pepper plants.",

MicroRNA-34 (miR-34) gene plays a key role in altering the apoptotic cycle and pathways of downstream cells, and therefore influences carcinogenesis. In this case-control study, we assessed the role of the pri-miR-34b/c rs4938723 polymorphism in HCC risk. The pri-miR-34b/c polymorphic genotype was determined in 286 patients with HCC and 572 controls using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. The male gender (X2 = 12.95, P &lt; 0.001), regular alcohol consumption (X2 = 16.81, P &lt; 0.001), and a family history of cancer (X2 = 11.88, P = 0.001) were associated with HCC risk. However, the age (t = 1.19, P = 0.12) and tobacco smoking habit (X2 = 0.64, P = 0.42) of HCC patients were comparable to those of the controls. The TC (adjusted OR = 1.46, 95%CI = 1.06-2.01) and CC (adjusted OR = 3.07, 95%CI = 1.77-5.34) genotypes of pri-miR-34b/c rs4938723 were correlated with a higher risk of HCC compared to the TT genotype. Moreover, the TC+CC genotype was correlated with an increased risk of HCC compared to the TT genotype (adjusted OR = 1.64, 95%CI = 1.21-2.22). In the recessive model, the CC genotype of pri-miR-34b/c rs4938723 was significantly correlated with an elevated risk of HCC compared to the TT+TC genotype (adjusted OR = 2.50, 95%CI = 1.49-4.22).

This study aimed to verify genetic diversity and establish mean standards (leaf nutrient contents; LNCs) and relationships among leaf nutrients (LNC relationships; LNCRs) in seven conilon coffee genotypes during both pre-flowering and bean-filling stages. Twenty crops from several cities in the northern region of Esp\u00edrito Santo State, Brazil, with crop yield either equal to or greater than 100 bags per hectare (during two harvests) were assessed. A total of 140 samples were collected during each evaluation period for quantification of leaf nutrient contents (N, P, K, Ca, Mg, S, Fe, Zn, Cu, Mn, and B). The Ward procedure, a hierarchical genetic clustering method, was used to quantify the genetic diversity among genotypes. To examine differences between the LNCs and LNCRs, F-and Scott-Knott tests were used. LNCs and LNCRs showed significant differences among the conilon coffee genotypes during the evaluation periods. Additionally, the 8V, 10V,and 12V genotypes exhibited the highest values for most of the nutrients, especially for N, P, and Cu. Therefore, the clustering method revealed genetic diversity among genotypes for standard leaf nutrient levels, implying that leaf diagnosis could be specific to each genotype and phenological stage.",

We aimed to standardize the kinetoplast DNA (kDNA) enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC) sequence polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method for molecular epidemiological identification of Leishmania strains, and estimate existing inter-strain genomic differences and kDNA signatures using this technique. ERIC-PCR of genomic DNA revealed genetic polymorphisms between species, although some strains shared many DNA fragments. Leishmania guyanensis, L. amazonensis, and L. braziliensis clustered together in a dendrogram with similarities ranging from 42.0 to 61.0%, whereas L. chagasi grouped with these three species with a similarity of 28.0%. After amplification of kDNA, 780-bp bands were extracted from an agarose gel and purified for analysis of its genetic signature. kDNA ERIC-PCR electrophoretic patterns consisted of 100- to 600- bp fragments. Using these profiles, L. braziliensis and L. guyanensis grouped with a similarity of 26.0%, and L. amazonensis and L. chagasi clustered based on a similarity of 100%. The electrophoretic profiles and dendrograms showed that, for epidemiological identification by ERIC-PCR, genomic DNA had greater discriminatory power than kDNA did. More strains need to be analyzed to validate the kDNA ERIC-PCR method. The genomes of these strains should be sequenced for better epidemiological identification of Leishmania species.",

In the last few years, some advances in this context have been achieved. Here we aimed to review and discuss published data on the more recent acquisition in the diagnosis of MTC.\nEVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A literature search of the medical databases was conducted by searching papers reporting tool for diagnosis of MTC published in the last years. The search was updated until July 2016.\nEVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: The literature search revealed several relevant articles which focused on different topics of the diagnosis of MTC. The results are reported by four paragraphs, such as 1) fine-needle aspiration; 2) molecular analysis; 3) serum markers; 4) imaging.\nCONCLUSIONS: The measurement of calcitonin in FNA washout fluids is essential due to poor accuracy of conventional cytology to detect MTC. Genetic analysis can help to identify those advanced MTC with poorer prognosis who do not respond to chemotherapy. Procalcitonin may in the next future replace calcitonin as serum diagnostic marker of MTC. Recent evidence based data seem to suggest the emerging role of functional imaging in recurrent MTC in patients with calcitonin serum levels >150 pg/mL.",

Areas covered: In this review, the authors discuss anti-cancer, anti-allergy, anti-infectious, and proprietary Chinese Medicines (pCM) for various chronic diseases (such as the allergic diseases: eczema, asthma and allergic rhinitis), which remain the contemporary therapeutic strategies that are being explored and developed. Drug transporters, disease specific biomarkers, pharmacophores, bioactive natural products and pharmacogenetics are some aspects of research technologies. Proprietary Chinese medicine remains one of the most popular strategies. There is however the issue of good research documentation of efficacy versus adverse effects. China has a complex healthcare system involving a large patient pool. Expert opinion: Various factors can impact drug development in China including the concurrent use of both western and Chinese medicines, pharmacogenetic variances, lack of multidisciplinary team impact on disease management and drug safety.

        "abstract": "Community-based studies have consistently shown a sex ratio heavily skewed towards males in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). The factors underlying this predominance of males are largely unknown, but the way girls score on standardized categorical diagnostic tools might account for the underrecognition of ASD in girls. Despite the existence of different norms for boys and girls with ASD on several major screening tests, the algorithm of the Autism Diagnosis Interview-Revised (ADI-R) has not been reformulated. The aim of our study was to investigate which ADI-R items discriminate between males and females, and to evaluate their weighting in the final diagnosis of autism. We then conducted discriminant analysis (DA) on a sample of 594 probands including 129 females with ASD, recruited by the Paris Autism Research International Sibpair (PARIS) Study. A replication analysis was run on an independent sample of 1716 probands including 338 females with ASD, recruited through the Autism Genetics Resource Exchange (AGRE) program. Entering the raw scores for all ADI-R items as independent variables, the DA correctly classified 78.9% of males and 72.9% of females (P\u2009<\u20090.001) in the PARIS cohort, and 72.2% of males and 68.3% of females (P\u2009<\u20090.0001) in the AGRE cohort. Among the items extracted by the stepwise DA, four belonged to the ADI-R algorithm used for the final diagnosis of ASD. In conclusion, several items of the ADI-R that are taken into account in the diagnosis of autism significantly differentiates between males and females. The potential gender bias thus induced may participate in the underestimation of the prevalence of ASD in females.

        "abstract": "None: Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a prevalent, autosomal co-dominant disorder of lipid metabolism that results in elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels and premature atherosclerosis. Screening for and identifying heterozygous FH in childhood is critical, given its high prevalence and asymptomatic presentation. Furthermore, treatment of FH in childhood is effective at lowering LDL-C levels and has the potential to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events in adulthood. Selective screening based on family history had previously been recommended to identify children and adolescents with FH or other lipid disorders. However, studies indicated that many individuals with heterozygous FH were missed with this approach, and therefore in 2011 the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Expert Panel recommended universal screening of children and adolescents between ages 9 and 11 years and again at ages 17 to 21 years, in addition to selective screening, in order to identify pediatric individuals with heterozygous FH. This approach was affirmed in the 2018 American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) Cholesterol Guidelines, along with endorsing cascade screening as another reasonable approach to identifying children with FH. Once FH is diagnosed, prompt treatment with lifestyle modification should be initiated. When lifestyle interventions are not sufficient, pharmacotherapy using statins has been shown to be effective at lowering LDL-C, generally safe in short and medium- term studies, and may be beneficial at reducing ASCVD events. Other medications can be useful at lowering LDL-C in conjunction with statin therapy, although generally statins are sufficient in young patients. Homozygous FH is a rare disorder manifesting as extremely high LDL-C and ASCVD in childhood, requiring aggressive multimodal management. Overall, studies are needed to determine the optimal timing and intensity of statin therapy, and to better understand long-term safety and ASCVD outcomes in adulthood for lipid-lowering pharmacotherapy initiated in pediatric patients with heterozygous FH.

        "abstract": "None: Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the CYP27A1 gene. These patients lack mitochondrial sterol 27-hydroxylase enzyme, which is responsible for conversion of cholesterol to cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) in bile acid synthesis pathway. CYP27A1 mutation leads to decreased synthesis of bile acid, excess production of cholestanol, and consequent accumulation of cholestanol in tissues, including brain, leading to progressive neurological dysfunction marked by dementia, spinal cord paresis, and cerebellar ataxia. Deposition in other tissues causes tendon xanthomas, premature atherosclerosis, and cataracts. The clinical manifestations usually start at infancy and develop during the first and second decades of life. The diagnosis of CTX is based on clinical findings, biochemical testing, and neuroimaging. Molecular genetic analysis although not necessary for initiation of treatment, provides definitive confirmation of CTX. Early initiation of CDCA is the treatment of choice for neurological and non-neurological symptoms of CTX and treatment with cholic acid has also been shown to be effective for non-neurological symptoms.

        "abstract": "None: Clinical practice guidelines are developed to create a synthesis of evidence which, in turn, leads to recommendations that improve clinical decision-making. Guidelines are helpful for busy clinicians to improve outcomes and reduce unnecessary practice variation. Historically, guidelines were largely based on expert opinion. The modern approach to guideline development includes a complete review and grading of the available evidence. The evidence is then used to construct recommendations for clinical practice with grades based on the level of evidence to support them. Pediatric lipid guidelines were first published in 1992. These guidelines included a screening approach based on family history and recommended a population approach to improve diet and physical activity in all children and adolescents, as well as a high-risk approach. This approach focused on treatment with lifestyle or with pharmacologic agents for those identified at high risk. The 2011 Integrated Guidelines provide the most comprehensive and up-to-date approach to pediatric dyslipidemia. In these guidelines, universal screening in 9-11-year-olds is recommended to identify children with genetic dyslipidemia or more lifestyle- related dyslipidemia. Pharmacologic treatment is recommended only for a small group of children and adolescents with marked elevation of LDL-C due to genetic dyslipidemias.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a growing and significant threat to public health on a global scale. Escherichia coli comprises Gram-negative, fecal-borne pathogenic and commensal bacteria that are frequently associated with antibiotic resistance. AMR E. coli can be ingested via food, water and direct contact with fecal contamination.\nMETHODS: We estimated the prevalence of AMR Escherichia coli from select drinking water sources in northern Tanzania. Water samples (n\u2009=\u2009155) were collected and plated onto Hi-Crome E. coli and MacConkey agar. Presumptive E. coli were confirmed by using a uidA PCR assay. Antibiotic susceptibility breakpoint assays were used to determine the resistance patterns of each isolate for 10 antibiotics. Isolates were also characterized by select PCR genotyping and macro-restriction digest assays.\nRESULTS: E. coli was isolated from 71\u00a0% of the water samples, and of the 1819 E. coli tested, 46.9\u00a0% were resistant to one or more antibiotics. Resistance to ampicillin, streptomycin, sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, and trimethoprim was significantly higher (15-30\u00a0%) compared to other tested antibiotics (0-6\u00a0%; P\u2009&lt;\u20090.05). Of the \u03b2-lactam-resistant isolates, bla <sub>TEM-1</sub> was predominant (67\u00a0%) followed by bla <sub>CTX-M</sub> (17.7\u00a0%) and bla <sub>SHV-1</sub> (6.0\u00a0%). Among the tetracycline-resistant isolates, tet(A) was predominant (57.4\u00a0%) followed by tet(B) (24.0\u00a0%). E. coli isolates obtained from these water sources were genetically diverse with few matching macro-restriction digest patterns.\nCONCLUSION: Water supplies in northern Tanzania may be a source of AMR E. coli for people and animals. Further studies are needed to identify the source of these contaminants and devise effective intervention strategies.",

Although originally developed for supervised analyses, i.e., to test the association between gene sets and an outcome variable, gene set testing also has important unsupervised applications, e.g., p-value weighting. For unsupervised testing, however, few effective gene set testing methods are available with support especially poor for several biologically relevant use cases.\nRESULTS: In this paper, we describe two new unsupervised gene set testing methods based on random matrix theory, the Marc\u0306enko-Pastur Distribution Test (MPDT) and the Tracy-Widom Test (TWT), that support both self-contained and competitive null hypotheses. For the self-contained case, we contrast our proposed tests with the classic multivariate test based on a modified likelihood ratio criterion. For the competitive case, we compare the new tests against a competitive version of the classic test and our recently developed Spectral Gene Set Enrichment (SGSE) method. Evaluation of the TWT and MPDT methods is based on both simulation studies and a weighted p-value analysis of two real gene expression data sets using gene sets drawn from MSigDB collections.\nCONCLUSIONS: The MPDT and TWT methods are novel and effective tools for unsupervised gene set analysis with superior statistical performance relative to existing techniques and the ability to generate biologically important results on real genomic data sets.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Bladder cancer is a very heterogeneous disease as regards natural history. Environmental exposures, constitutional genetic and/or epigenetic background may affect not only the likelihood of bladder tumor occurrence, but also the histologic type of cancer and its outcome. Currently, only a few data are available to study the prognostic role of genetic and environmental factors. Likewise, data on the economic burden of bladder cancer and the longitudinal impact of the disease and the treatments on patient quality of life are scarce.\nMETHODS: COBLAnCE is a large French-based clinical cohort study on bladder cancer. Newly diagnosed patients are enrolled prospectively in 12 public hospitals and 5 private for profits hospitals. The target sample size is 2,000 patients. All patients are to be followed for 6\u00a0years. Information on patient characteristics and lifestyle is collected during a face-to-face interview at enrollment. Clinical information on disease presentation, diagnosis, and treatment is extracted from medical records for the primary tumor and for all subsequent local and distant recurrences. Quality of life and resource use is collected at recruitment and during follow-up. In parallel, 4 types of biological samples (blood, tumor tissue, urine and nail) are collected, at baseline and during follow-up. DNA, RNA and PBMLs are extracted from blood samples, DNA and RNA from stabilized urine, proteins from frozen urine, DNA, RNA and proteins from frozen tumor tissues, and DNA and RNA from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissues. All derived products are stored at -80\u00a0\u00b0C or in liquid nitrogen. Main endpoints are gene-environment interactions, molecular classification, biomarker discovery, therapeutic innovation, treatment patterns, healthcare resource use, bladder cancer outcomes and quality of life.\nDISCUSSION: The COBLAnCE cohort will provide considerable insight into the biology of bladder cancer and the mechanisms through which genetic and environmental factors may influence the prognosis. It may allow the discovery of emerging biomarkers. Finally, economic data will be useful for future cost-effectiveness studies of immunotherapy drugs or other therapeutics in bladder cancer.",

        "title": "Perceptions and actions of Dutch sheep farmers concerning worm infections.",
        "abstract": "Gastrointestinal (GI) nematode infections are considered among one of the toughest challenges sheep farmers face worldwide. Control still is largely based on the use of anthelmintics, but anthelmintic resistance is becoming rampant. To facilitate implementation of alternative nematode control strategies and to reduce anthelmintic usage, the purpose of this study was twofold: (i) to gain insight in common practices, knowledge gaps and perceptions of farmers regarding nematode control, and (ii) to provide foci of attention for improving parasite control practices and transfer of knowledge within the sheep husbandry. An internet-based questionnaire was made available to all sheep farmers pertaining to the year 2013, resulting in 450 entered questionnaires for analysis. The two most important nematodes mentioned, were Haemonchus contortus and, to a lesser extent, Nematodirus battus. Of all respondents, 25.6% said they did not have any worm problems. Of these, almost a third did notice clinical signs that can be related to worm infections and about three quarters did use anthelmintics. Overall, clinical symptoms mentioned by farmers matched the worm species they identified as the cause of problems. Ewes and lambs were treated up to 6 times in 2013. On average, ewes were treated 1.53 and lambs 2.05 times. Farmers who treated their ewes more often, also treated their lambs more often (P<0.001). Both ewes and lambs were frequently treated based on fixed moments such as around lambing, at weaning and before mating, rather than based on faecal egg counts. Treatments based on faecal egg counts were practiced, but on a minority of the farms (32.7%). The majority of the farms (75.6%) did not leave 2-5% of the sheep within a flock untreated. About 74% of farmers keep newly purchased animals quarantined for at least 10days, but some (13.4%) leave quarantined animals untreated nor check faecal egg counts. Of farmers who do treat their quarantined animals, just 12.6% check the efficacy of the treatment. Slightly over 40% of the respondents said they did not experience bottlenecks in parasite control. Yet, over half of these said having problems with worm infections, over half did see clinical signs related to worm infections and over three quarters used anthelmintics. Within the group of farmers experiencing difficulties in parasite control, the most often mentioned bottleneck concerned pasture management (75.8%). When asking farmers for solutions, 90% of all respondents indicated they are willing to adjust their pasture management. Farmers are also interested in other methods to reduce the risk of worm infections, such as possibilities to enhance the immune system of sheep in general (71%), to increase specific genetic resistance to worms and to apply anti-parasite forages, both about 40%. Results of this study gave the following potential foci of attention: (1) making complex scientific knowledge more accessible to farmers through simple tools and applicable in the daily farming process; (2) changing the mindset of farmers about their current worm control practices, i.e. breaking long-standing habits such as treating ewes and lambs at fixed moments rather than based on actual worm infection monitoring data; (3) demonstrating effective pasture rotation schemes on specific farms and using these in extension work; (4) making farmers more aware that checking anthelmintic efficacy is important; (5) improving quarantine procedures; (6) creating a wider array of applicable alternative control measures from which individual farmers can choose what fits them most; and finally, (7) improving mutual understanding among farmers, veterinary practitioners and parasitologists alike.",

A cross-sectional study was conducted in 81 MHP, 9-12 weeks of age, from 10 municipalities in Yucatan, Mexico. The prevalence was estimated by the detection of T. gondii IgG antibodies via an indirect ELISA assay. The parasite burden was also determined by testing genomic DNA from sampled tissues using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), which amplified a 62bp product from the B1 gene of T. gondii. The seroprevalence was 53% (43/81), ranging from 0 to 100% seropositivity rate depending on the municipalitie of origin. The qPCR allowed detection of T. gondii in 5.3% (9/168) of the tissue samples, with an average of 2.5\u00b12.71 parasites per gram (0.17\u00b10.18 parasite equivalent) for the leg muscle tissue, 0.26\u00b10.39 (0.01\u00b10.02 parasite equivalent) for the heart tissue and 0.31\u00b10.37 (0.021\u00b10.025 parasite equivalent) for the tongue tissue. No significant difference (p>0.05) was observed in the proportion and parasite burden among the different types of tissues evaluated. As shown by the ELISA, a high seroprevalence of T. gondii exists in MHP from the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. The parasite burden found in the tissues showed similar tropism; therefore, the consumption of these tissues involves the same risk of acquiring infection if not properly cooked.",

        "abstract": "Eimeria species cause coccidiosis, most notably in chickens where the global cost exceeds US$3 billion every year. Understanding variation in Eimeria population structure and genetic diversity contributes valuable information that can be used to minimise the impact of drug resistance and develop new, cost-effective anticoccidial vaccines. Little knowledge is currently available on the epidemiology of Eimeria species and strains in different regions, or under different chicken production systems. Recently, 244 Eimeria tenella isolates collected from countries in Africa and Asia were genotyped using a Sequenom single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) tool, revealing significant variation in haplotype diversity and population structure, with a marked North/South regional divide. To expand studies on genetic polymorphism to larger numbers of E. tenella populations in other geographic regions a cheaper and more accessible technique, such as polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP), is desirable. We have converted a subset of SNP markers for use as PCR-RFLPs and re-analysed the original 244 isolates with the PCR-RFLPs to assess their utility. In addition, application of the PCR-RFLP to E. tenella samples collected from UK and Irish broiler chickens revealed a tightly restricted haplotype diversity. Just two of the PCR-RFLPs accounted for all of the polymorphism detected in the UK and Irish parasite populations, but analysis of the full dataset revealed different informative markers in different regions, supporting validity of the PCR-RFLP panel. The tools described here provide an accessible and cost-effective method that can be used to enhance understanding of E. tenella genetic diversity and population structure.",

        "abstract": "We illustrate the work necessary to reverse course after identification of a KCNQ1 variant interpreted erroneously as causing long QT syndrome (LQTS) and to identify the true cause of a case of sudden death in the young. Surrogate genetic testing of a decedent's living brother identified a rare KCNQ1-V133I variant, which prompted an implantable cardioverter defibrillator and subsequent diagnosis of LQTS in other family members. Subsequently, this presumed LQT1 family came to our institution for further clinical evaluation and research-based investigations, including KCNQ1-V133I variant-specific analysis of the decedent, heterologous expression studies of KCNQ1-V133I, and a whole-exome molecular autopsy along with genomic triangulation using his unaffected parents' DNA. After evaluating several V133I-positive family members, clinical doubt was cast on the veracity of the previously levied diagnosis of LQT1, resulting in a re-opening of the case and an intense pursuit of the lethal substrate. Furthermore, the decedent tested negative for V133I, and heterologous expression studies demonstrated a normal cellular phenotype for V133I-containing Kv7.1 channels. Instead, after whole-exome molecular autopsy, a de novo pathogenic variant (p.R454W) in DES-encoded desmin was identified. As detailed herein, the forensic evaluation of sudden death in the young requires meticulous focus on the decedent followed by a careful and deliberate assessment of the decedent's relatives. Surrogate genetic testing can have disastrous consequences and should be avoided. Genetic test results require careful scrutiny to avoid unintended and potentially devastating repercussions. Although the root cause of the decedent's tragic death would have remained a mystery, the unintended consequences for the living relatives described herein might have been avoided based on clinical grounds alone. All family members had electrocardiograms with normal QT intervals, making the diagnosis of familial LQTS unlikely. As such, if the clinicians caring for these patients had focused solely on clinical data from the survivors, there might have been no reason to embark on a path of inappropriate treatment based on genetic testing.",

        "abstract": "In genetic diversity and population structure of Echinococcus granulosus, the gene flow can illustrate how the Echinococcus isolates have epidemiologically drifted among endemic neighboring countries. 51 isolates of hydatid cysts were collected from human, dog, cattle and sheep in northwest Iran, where placed co-border with Turkey. DNA samples were extracted, amplified and subjected to sequence analysis of NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1 (nad1) and cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) genes. As well, sequences of Echinococcus at east to the southeast regions of Turkey were retrieved from GenBank database for the cox1 gene. The confirmed isolates were grouped as G1 (n\u00a0=\u00a074) and G3 (n\u00a0=\u00a06) genotypes. 31 unique haplotypes were identified inferred by the analyzed sequences of cox1 among two distinct populations. A parsimonious network of the sequence haplotypes displayed star-like features in the overall population containing TUR1, IR15 and IR22 as the most common haplotypes. According to AMOVA test, the high value of haplotype diversity (0.94758-0.98901) of E. granulosus was reflected the total genetic variability within populations while nucleotide diversity was low (0.00727-0.01046) in Iranian and Turkish metapopulations. Neutrality indices of the cox1 were shown negative values (-15.078 to\u00a0-10.057) in Echinococcus populations which indicating a significant divergence from neutrality. A pairwise fixation index (Fst) as a degree of gene flow was partially high value for all populations (0.151). The statistically Fst value indicates that E.\u00a0granulosus sensu stricto (G1-G3) are genetically moderate differentiated among Iranian and Turkish isolates. The occurrence of TUR1 and IR15 elucidate that there is possibly the dawn of domestication due to transfer of alleles between populations through the diffusion of stock raising or anthropogenic movements.

Recent studies showed that certain unicellular eukaryotes contain fragments of NCLDV DNA integrated in their genome, when surprisingly many of these organisms were not previously shown to be infected by NCLDVs. These findings prompted us to search the genome of Acanthamoeba castellanii strain Neff (Neff), one of the most prolific hosts in the discovery of giant NCLDVs, for possible DNA inserts of viral origin. We report the identification of 267 markers of lateral gene transfer with viruses, approximately half of which are clustered in Neff genome regions of viral origins, transcriptionally inactive or exhibit nucleotide-composition signatures suggestive of a foreign origin. The integrated viral genes had diverse origin among relatives of viruses that infect Neff, including Mollivirus, Pandoravirus, Marseillevirus, Pithovirus, and Mimivirus However, phylogenetic analysis suggests the existence of a yet-undiscovered family of amoeba-infecting NCLDV in addition to the five already characterized. The active transcription of some apparently anciently integrated virus-like genes suggests that some viral genes might have been domesticated during the amoeba evolution. These insights confirm that genomic insertion of NCLDV DNA is a common theme in eukaryotes. This gene flow contributed fertilizing the eukaryotic gene repertoire and participated in the occurrence of orphan genes, a long standing issue in genomics. Search for viral inserts in eukaryotic genomes followed by environmental screening of the original viruses should be used to isolate radically new NCLDVs.",

        "abstract": "Research on fungal pathogens with the aim to identify virulence determinants strictly relies on the generation of defined, recombinant strains, a task that is executed by means of a sophisticated molecular biology toolbox. Recent developments in fungal genome engineering have opened a new frontier by implementing the CRISPR-Cas9 technology, based on expression of the Cas9 endonuclease that is loaded by a single guiding RNA (sgRNA) molecule to target a defined site in the recipient genome. This novel approach has been adapted successfully to engineer fungal genomes, among them the one of the human-pathogenic mould Aspergillus fumigatus Implementation of the required components was achieved by various means that differ with respect to expression of the Cas9 enzyme and sgRNA delivery. Validation of CRISPR-Cas9-mediated mutagenesis could be executed by targeting selected candidate genes of A. fumigatus to provide a promising perspective for screening and multiplexing approaches to scrutinize the virulome of this opportunistic fungal pathogen in a comprehensive manner, such as by analyzing genetic polymorphisms or the function of gene families.",

        "abstract": "Very/extremely premature infants often experience glycaemic dysregulation, resulting in abnormally elevated (hyperglycaemia) or low (hypoglycaemia) blood glucose (BG) concentrations, due to prematurity, stress, and illness. STAR-GRYPHON is a computerised protocol that utilises a model-based insulin sensitivity parameter to directly tailor therapy for individual patients and their changing conditions, unlike other common insulin protocols in this cohort. From January 2013 to January 2015, 13 patients totalling 16 hyperglycaemic control episodes received insulin under STAR-GRYPHON. A significant improvement in control was achieved in comparison to a retrospective cohort, with a 26% absolute improvement in BG within the targeted range and no hypoglycaemia. This improvement was obtained predominantly due to the reduction of hyperglycaemia (%BG>10.0 mmol/l: 5.6 vs. 17.7%, p<0.001), and lowering of the median per-patient BG [6.9 (6.1-7.9) vs. 7.8 (6.6-9.1) mmol/l, p<0.001, Mann-Witney U test]. While cohort-wide control results show good control overall, there is high intra-patient variability in BG behaviour, resulting in overly conservative treatments for some patients. Patient insulin sensitivity differs between and within patients over time, with some patients having stable insulin sensitivity, while others change rapidly. These results demonstrate the trade-off between safety and performance in a highly variable and fragile cohort.",

GIO was induced in 12 weeks old female C57BL/6J and CD1 mice by subcutaneous insertion of long-term release prednisolone or placebo pellets. Biomechanical properties as assessed by three point bent testing revealed that femoral elasticity and strength significantly decreased in CD1 mice receiving GC, whereas C57BL/6J mice showed no differences between placebo and prednisolone treatment. Bone turnover assessed by microcomputer tomography revealed that contrary to C57BL/6J mice, prednisolone treated CD1 mice developed osteoporosis. In vitro experiments have underlined that, at a cellular level, C57BL/6J mice osteoclasts and osteoblasts were less responsive to GC treatment and tolerated higher doses than CD1 cells. Whilst administration of long-term release prednisolone pellets provided a robust GIO animal model in 12 weeks old CD1 mice, age matched C57BL/6J mice were not susceptible to the bone changes associated with GIO. This study indicates that for the induction of experimental GIO, the mouse strain choice together with other factors such as age should be carefully evaluated.",

        "title": "Time-to-response toxicity analysis as a method for drug susceptibility assessment in salmon lice.",
        "abstract": "UNLABELLED: The salmon louse Lepeophtheirus salmonis (Kr\u00f8yer, 1837) is an ectoparasite causing infections of wild and farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) in the Northern hemisphere. While L. salmonis control at commercial mariculture sites increasingly employs non-medicinal approaches, such as cage designs reducing infection rates and biological control through cleaner fish, anti-parasitic drugs are still a requirement for effective fish health care. With only a limited range of salmon delousing agents available, all of which have been in use for more than a decade, drug resistance formation has been reported for different products. Successful resistance management requires reliable susceptibility assessment, which is usually achieved through L. salmonis bioassays. These tests involve the exposure of parasites to different drug concentrations and require significant numbers of suitable L. salmonis stages. The present study reports an alternative bioassay that is based on time-to-response toxicity analyses and can be carried out with limited parasite numbers. The assay determines the median effective time (ET<sub>50</sub>), i.e., the time required until impaired swimming and/or attachment behaviour becomes apparent in 50% of parasites, by conducting repeated examinations of test animals starting at the time point where exposure to a set drug concentration commences. This experimental approach further allows the estimation of the apparent drug susceptibility of individual L. salmonis by determining their time to response, which may prove useful in experiments designed to elucidate associations between genetic factors and the drug susceptibility phenotype of parasites. Three laboratory strains of L. salmonis differing in susceptibility to emamectin benzoate were characterised using standard 24\u00a0h bioassays and time-to-response toxicity assays. While both the median effective concentration (EC<sub>50</sub>) and the ET<sub>50</sub> showed variability between experimental repeats, both types of bioassay consistently discriminated susceptible and drug-resistant L. salmonis laboratory strains.\nSTATEMENT OF RELEVANCE: Infections by sea lice cause significant costs to the global salmon farming industry, which have been estimated to exceed \u20ac300 million per year worldwide. Control of sea lice still relies to a significant extent on chemical delousing; however, chemical control is threatened by resistance formation. Resistance can be combated by rotation between different drugs and strategic implementation of non-medicinal strategies. However, resistance management requires reliable and feasible methods of susceptibility assessment. The present study is a technical note introducing a novel approach to susceptibility assessments in sea lice. The method can be applied in susceptibility assessments on farms, where it offers the advantage of a reduced requirement of parasites for testing. In addition, the novel method allows deriving the times of parasite require to show a response after drug treatment has started, thus providing a variable characterizing the drug susceptibility phenotype of individual parasites. Accordingly, the bioassay approach presented here will be useful for studies aiming at unravelling the genetic determinants of drug resistance.",

One patient was symptomatic with recent transient ischaemic attack. Follow-up was undertaken at 1-month post-procedure with CECT to assess PAVMs permeability and MVP positioning and at 1-, 6-, and 12-month post-procedure, with echocardiography/bubble test and standard neurological history, to confirm absence of right-to-left shunts and recurrent symptoms.\nRESULTS: Eight PAVMs were treated in 4 patients over 5 interventional sessions (mean 1.6 PAVMs per session). All PAVMs were simple, with mean feeding artery diameter of 4.25\u00a0mm. Eight 6.5\u00a0mm MVPs were deployed in total (one per lesion). Technical success was 100%. Mean procedural time and patient dose per session were 70\u00a0min (range 40-70\u00a0min) and 53418\u00a0mGy.cm2 (range 6113-101628\u00a0mGy.cm2), respectively. No signs of reperfusion neither of MPV migration were noted at 1-month CECT follow-up. At early follow-up (mean 3.75\u00a0months; range 1-12\u00a0months), clinical success was 100% with no evidence of recurrent right-to-left shunt, and no neurological symptoms. No immediate or late complications were observed.\nCONCLUSIONS: MVP embolization of PAVMs appears technically feasible, safe, and effective at early follow-up.

Diagnosis was prompted by known maternal carrier status (40%), positive family history (23%), bleeding (35%) and unknown 2%; 81% bled during the first two years. The most common events were bleeding (circumcision, soft tissue, oral bleeding) and head injury. There were 46 episodes of intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) in 37 babies (7%): 18 spontaneous, 14 delivery related, 11 traumatic, 2 procedure related and 1 unknown cause. Of the 176 central venous access devices (CVADs) in 148 (27%) babies, there were 137 ports, 22 surgically inserted central catheters and 20 peripherally inserted central catheters. Ports had the lowest complication rates. Inhibitors occurred in 109 (20%) babies who experienced higher rates of ICH (14% vs. 5%; P = 0.002), CVAD placement (61% vs. 19%; P < 0.001) and CVAD complications (44% vs. 26%; P < 0.001). The most common replacement therapy was recombinant clotting factor concentrates.\nCONCLUSION: Bleeding events in haemophilic babies \u22642 years were common; no detectable difference in the rates of ICH by the mode of delivery was noted. Neonatal factor exposure did not affect the inhibitor rates. Minor head trauma, soft tissue and oropharyngeal bleeding were the leading indications for treatment.",

Three hundred and eighty-five potato samples (six different cultivars) collected in autumn 2007 from nine regions in Tunisia were tested for PVY infection by DAS-ELISA. The virus was detected in all regions surveyed, with an average incidence of 80.26%. Subsequently, a panel of 82 Tunisian PVY isolates (PVY-TN) was subjected to systematic biological, serological and molecular typing using immunocapture reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and a series of PVYOC- and PVYN-specific monoclonal antibodies. Combined analyses revealed ~67% of PVYNTN variants of which 17 were sequenced in the 5'NTR-P1 region to assess the genetic diversity and phylogenetic relationship of PVY-TN against other worldwide PVY isolates. To investigate whether selective constraints could act on viral genomic RNA, synonymous and non-synonymous substitution rates and their ratio were analyzed. Averages of all pairwise comparisons obtained in the 5'NTR-P1 region allowed more synonymous changes, suggesting selective constraint acting in this region. Selective neutrality test was significantly negative, suggesting a rapid expansion of PVY isolates. Pairwise mismatch distribution gave a bimodal pattern and pointed to an eventually early evolution characterizing these sequences. Genetic haplotype network topology provided evidence of the existence of a distinct geographical structure. This is the first report of such genetic analyses conducted on PVY isolates from Tunisia.",

We enrolled 275 Uyghur and 305 age- and gender-matched Han subjects, and used polymerase chain reaction to detect single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; -44G/A and +71A/G) in the gene encoding Cx40. A mutation screening was performed by direct sequencing and calculation of genotype and allele frequencies among AF patients and control subjects to determine the relationship between these variants and this condition in Uyghur and Han populations. The two SNPs examined were significantly associated with AF in both ethnic groups. Further analysis showed the SNPs to be in perfect linkage disequilibrium in both AF and control groups among Uyghur and Han individuals. In both populations -44AA genotype and A allele frequencies among AF patients were significantly higher than those in the control group. In addition, under the dominant model (GG vs GA+AA), a significant difference in the distribution of Cx40 -44G/A genotypes was detected between patients and controls. Logistic regression analysis revealed that Cx40 genetic polymorphisms increase AF risk in Uyghur and Han residents of Xinjiang. In conclusion, both the -44G/A and +71A/G variants of the gene encoding this protein are associated with AF in Uyghur and Han populations in northern China.",

The clinical features of SIOD arise from pathological changes in gene expression; however, the underlying mechanism for these gene expression alterations remains unclear. We hypothesized that changes of the epigenome alter gene expression in SIOD. To test this, we performed a genetic screen for interaction between Marcal1, the Drosophila melanogaster ortholog of SMARCAL1, and the genes of the trithorax group (trxG) and Polycomb group (PcG), which encode epigenetic regulators. SMARCAL1 and Marcal1 genetically interacted with trxG and PcG members. A homozygous null mutation of Marcal1 suppressed the wing-to-haltere transformation, ectopic Ultrabithorax (Ubx) expression, and ectopic Ubx minigene expression caused by PcG deficiency. The suppression of ectopic Ubx expression correlated with reduced chromatin accessibility of the Ubx promoter. To our knowledge, this is the first in vivo evidence for deficiency of a SMARCAL1 ortholog altering the chromatin structure of a gene.",

RA increases the CV mortality by up to 50\u00a0% compared with the global population and CV disease is the leading cause of death in patients with RA. There is growing evidence that RA favors accelerated atherogenesis secondary to endothelial dysfunction (ED) that occurs early in the course of the disease. ED is a functional and reversible alteration of endothelial cells, leading to a shift of the actions of the endothelium towards reduced vasodilation, proinflammatory state, proliferative and prothrombotic properties. The mechanistic links between RA and ED have not been fully explained, but growing evidence suggests a role for traditional CV factors, auto-antibodies, genetic factors, oxidative stress, inflammation and iatrogenic interventions such as glucocorticoids (GCs) use. GCs have been used in RA for several decades. Whilst their deleterious CV side effects were described in the 1950s, their effect on CV risk associated with inflammatory arthritis remains subject for debate. GC might induce negative effects on endothelial function, via a direct effect on endothelium or via increasing CV risk factors. Conversely, they might actually improve endothelial function by decreasing systemic and/or vascular inflammation. The present review summarizes the available data on the impact of GCs on endothelial function, both in normal and inflammatory conditions, with a special focus on RA patients.",

Ketamine as a novel glutamatergic antidepressant drug can induce a rapid antidepressant effect within hours. In a mechanistic proof of this concept, we examined whether ketamine leads to an increase in synaptogenesis and vascularization within 24 hours after a single injection in a genetic rat model of depression.\nMETHODS: Flinders Sensitive Line and Flinders Resistant Line rats were given a single intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (15 mg/kg) or saline. One day later, their behavior was evaluated by a modified forced swim test. Microvessel length was evaluated with global spatial sampling and optical microscopy, whereas the number of asymmetric synapses was quantified through serial section electron microscopy by using physical disector method in the CA1.stratum radiatum area of hippocampus.\nRESULTS: The immobility time in the forced swim test among Flinders Sensitive Line rats with ketamine treatment was significantly lower compared with Flinders Sensitive Line rats without treatment. The number of nonperforated and perforated synapses was significantly higher in the Flinders Sensitive Line-ketamine vs the Flinders Sensitive Line-vehicle group; however, ketamine did not induce a significant increase in the number of shaft synapses. Additionally, total length of microvessels was significantly increased 1 day after ketamine treatment in Flinders Sensitive Line rats in the hippocampal subregions, including the CA1.stratum radiatum.\nCONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that hippocampal vascularization and synaptogenesis is co-regulated rapidly after ketamine, and microvascular elongation may be a supportive factor for synaptic plasticity and neuronal activity.

The objective of this study was to identify antibiotic resistance determinants in Escherichia coli strains isolated from untreated and treated wastewater (UWW and TWW) and from river water sampled downstream and upstream (URW and DRW) from the effluent discharge point. The analyzed antibiotic groups were beta-lactams, tetracyclines and fluoroquinolones which are widely used in human and veterinary medicine. The virulence of the isolated E. coli strains was also analyzed, and their clonal relatedness was determined by ERIC (enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus sequence) PCR.

A total of 317 E. coli isolates resistant to at least one group of antibiotics were selected among bacterial isolates from river water and wastewater samples. Nearly 38% of those isolates were resistant to all of the tested antibiotics. The highest percent (43%) of multidrug-resistant isolates was noted in UWW samples. Isolates resistant to beta-lactams most frequently harbored bla<sub>TEM</sub> and bla<sub>OXA</sub> genes.

One hundred forty B. abortus strains isolated from cattle in Brazil between 2009 and 2013 were genotyped using a set of 18 variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) (MLVA16+HOOF-Print 3 and 4). The multiple locus VNTR analysis (MLVA) composed by eight markers (MLVA8) revealed eight different genotypes among B. abortus strains, including five previously described and three new ones. Analysis of the MLVA16 loci revealed fifty-eight distinct genotypes, from which three were identical, thirty-eight were considered very close, and seventeen were considered distant compared to those previously described and deposited in MLVAbank. Analysis of the HOOF-Prints 3 and 4 revealed the larger number of different alleles among all VNTR assessed, exhibiting maximum resolution when associated with MLVA16 markers. This study also provides insights on the genotypes of B. abortus circulating in Brazil, which certainly contribute for the better understanding of the epidemiology and control of bovine brucellosis in the country. Moreover, our data showed a high genetic diversity among the B. abortus strains isolated between 2009 and 2013, and a close relationship among these strains and Brazilian B. abortus deposited by MLVAbank.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of routine labour epidural analgesia (EA), from a societal perspective, as compared with labour analgesia on request.\nSTUDY DESIGN: Women delivering of a singleton in cephalic presentation beyond 36+0 weeks' gestation were randomly allocated to routine labour EA or analgesia on request in one university and one non-university teaching hospital in the Netherlands. Costs included all medical, non-medical and indirect costs from randomisation to 6 weeks postpartum. Effectiveness was defined as a non-operative, spontaneous vaginal delivery without EA-related maternal adverse effects. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was defined as the ratio of the difference in costs and the difference in effectiveness between both groups. Data were analysed according to intention to treat and divided into a base case analysis and a sensitivity analysis.\nRESULTS: Total delivery costs in the routine EA group (n=233) were higher than in the labour on request group (n=255) (difference -\u20ac 322, 95% CI -\u20ac 60 to \u20ac 355) due to more medication costs (including EA), a longer stay in the labour ward, and more operations including caesarean sections. Total postpartum hospital costs in the routine EA group were lower (difference -\u20ac 344, 95% CI -\u20ac 1338 to \u20ac 621) mainly due to less neonatal admissions (difference -\u20ac 472, 95% CI -\u20ac 1297 to \u20ac 331), whereas total postpartum home and others costs were comparable (difference -\u20ac 20, 95% CI -\u20ac 267 to \u20ac 248, and -\u20ac 1, 95% CI -\u20ac 67 to \u20ac 284, respectively). As a result, the overall mean costs per woman were comparable between the routine EA group and the analgesia on request group (\u20ac 8.708 and \u20ac 8.710, respectively, mean difference -\u20ac 2, 95% CI -\u20ac 1.012 to \u20ac 916). Routine labour EA resulted in more deliveries with maternal adverse effects, nevertheless the ICER remained low (\u20ac 8; bootstrap 95% CI -\u20ac 6.120 to \u20ac 8.659). The cost-effectiveness acceptability curve indicated a low probability that routine EA is cost-effective.\nCONCLUSION: Routine labour EA generates comparable costs as analgesia on request, but results in more operative deliveries and more EA-related maternal adverse effects. Based on cost-effectiveness, no preference can be given to routine labour EA as compared with analgesia on request.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Abdominal aortic calcium (AAC) predicts future cardiovascular disease (CVD) events and all-cause mortality independent of CVD risk factors. The standard AAC score, the Agatston, up-weights for greater calcium density, and thus models higher calcium density as associated with increased CVD risk. We determined associations of CVD risk factors with AAC volume and density (separately).\nMETHODS: In a multi-ethnic cohort of community living adults, we used abdominal computed tomography scans to measure AAC volume and density. Multivariable linear regression was used to determine the period cross-sectional independent associations of CVD risk factors with AAC volume and AAC density in participants with prevalent AAC.\nRESULTS: Among 1413 participants with non-zero AAC scores, the mean age was 65\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09 years, 52% were men, 44% were European-, 24% were Hispanic-, 18% were African-, and 14% were Chinese Americans (EA, HA, AA, and CA respectively). Median (interquartile range, IQR) for AAC volume was 628\u00a0mm3 (157-1939\u00a0mm3), and mean AAC density was 3.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.6. Compared to EA, each of HA, AA, and CA had lower natural log (ln) AAC volume, but higher AAC density. After adjustments for AAC density, older age, ever smoking history, higher systolic blood pressure, elevated total cholesterol, reduced HDL cholesterol, statin and anti-hypertensive medication use, family history of myocardial infarction, and alcohol consumption were significantly associated with higher ln(AAC volume). In contrast, after adjustments for ln(AAC volume), older age, ever smoking history, higher BMI, and lower HDL cholesterol were significantly associated with lower AAC density.\nCONCLUSIONS: Several CVD risk factors were associated with higher AAC volume, but lower AAC density. Future studies should investigate the impact of calcium density of aortic plaques in CVD.",

The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of clinical laboratories for HPV DNA detection and genotyping by an external quality assessment (EQA) program.\nMETHODS: The EQA panels were clinically validated by the Cobas 4800 HPV test, and then distributed to the participating laboratories in May 2015 (round 1) and September 2015 (round 2). Each panel consisted of one negative sample and nine positive cell or clinical samples of HPV16 and HPV18 types at different concentrations. In total, 40 laboratories submitted 18 qualitative and 22 genotyping data sets in round 1 and 44 laboratories submitted 18 qualitative and 26 genotyping data sets in round 2. In both rounds, all laboratories used commercial assays.\nRESULTS: The negative samples were detected correctly in both rounds by all participating laboratories. There were no false-positive results in the qualitative data sets and only two false-positive results in the genotyping data sets in each of round 1 and round 2. The false-negative rates were 8.0% for round 1 and 2.7% for round 2. For the qualitative data sets, almost all of the laboratories (100% for round 1 and 97.8% for round 2) obtained a score of acceptable or better. For the genotyping results, acceptable or better scores were obtained in 81.8% (round 1) and 100% (round 2).\nCONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the majority of laboratories in Shanghai have reliable diagnostic ability for HPV detection and genotyping. Moreover, this study emphasizes the importance of EQA for monitoring the performance of clinical laboratories.",

        "abstract": "The Y chromosome is currently by far the most popular marker in genetic genealogy that combines genetic data and family history. This popularity is based on its haploid character and its close association with the patrilineage and paternal inherited surname. Other markers have not been found (yet) to overrule this status due to the low sensitivity and precision of autosomal DNA for genetic genealogical applications, given the vagaries of recombination, and the lower capacities of mitochondrial DNA combined with an in general much lower interest in maternal lineages. The current knowledge about the Y chromosome and the availability of markers with divergent mutation rates make it possible to answer questions on relatedness levels which differ in time depth; from the individual and familial level to the surnames, clan and population level. The use of the Y chromosome in genetic genealogy has led to applications in several well-established research disciplines; namely in, e.g., family history, demography, anthropology, forensic sciences, population genetics and sex chromosome evolution. The information obtained from analysing this chromosome is not only interesting for academic scientists but also for the huge and lively community of amateur genealogists and citizen-scientists, fascinated in analysing their own genealogy or surname. This popularity, however, has also some drawbacks, mainly for privacy reasons related to the DNA donor, his close family and far-related namesakes. In this review paper we argue why Y-chromosomal analysis and its genetic genealogical applications will still perform an important role in future interdisciplinary research.",

        "abstract": "The burden of cardio-vascular and other age-related non-communicable diseases are rapidly increasing worldwide. Majority of these chronic ailments are curable, if diagnosed at early stages. Candidate biomarkers of early detection are therefore essential for identification of high-risk individuals, prompt and accurate disease diagnosis, and to monitor therapeutic response. The functional significance of circulating nucleic acids that recapitulate specific disease profiles is now well established. But subtle changes in DNA sequence may not solely reflect the differentiation of gene expression patterns observed in diverse set of diseases as epigenetic phenomena play a larger role in aetiology and patho-physiology. Unlike genetic markers, knowledge about the diagnostic utility of circulating epigenetic signatures: methylated DNA; micro RNA and modified histones are deficient. Characterization of these novel entities through omics-based molecular technologies might prompt development of a range of laboratory-based strategies, thereby accelerating their broader translational purpose for early disease diagnosis, monitoring therapeutic response and drug resistance. However, largest opportunity for innovation lies in developing point-of-care tests with accurate diagnostic and higher prognostic score that is applicable for screening of high-risk populations.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: As the prevalence of artemisinin-resistant Plasmodium falciparum malaria increases in the Greater Mekong subregion, emerging resistance to partner drugs in artemisinin combination therapies seriously threatens global efforts to treat and eliminate this disease. Molecular markers that predict failure of artemisinin combination therapy are urgently needed to monitor the spread of partner drug resistance, and to recommend alternative treatments in southeast Asia and beyond.\nMETHODS: We did a genome-wide association study of 297 P falciparum isolates from Cambodia to investigate the relationship of 11\u2008630 exonic single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 43 copy number variations (CNVs) with in-vitro piperaquine 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC<sub>50</sub>s), and tested whether these genetic variants are markers of treatment failure with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine. We then did a survival analysis of 133 patients to determine whether candidate molecular markers predicted parasite recrudescence following dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine treatment.\nFINDINGS: Piperaquine IC<sub>50</sub>s increased significantly from 2011 to 2013 in three Cambodian provinces (2011 vs 2013 median IC<sub>50</sub>s: 20\u00b70 nmol/L [IQR 13\u00b77-29\u00b70] vs 39\u00b72 nmol/L [32\u00b78-48\u00b71] for Ratanakiri, 19\u00b73 nmol/L [15\u00b71-26\u00b72] vs 66\u00b72 nmol/L [49\u00b79-83\u00b70] for Preah Vihear, and 19\u00b76 nmol/L [11\u00b79-33\u00b79] vs 81\u00b71 nmol/L [61\u00b73-113\u00b71] for Pursat; all p\u226410-3; Kruskal-Wallis test). Genome-wide analysis of SNPs identified a chromosome 13 region that associates with raised piperaquine IC<sub>50</sub>s. A non-synonymous SNP (encoding a Glu415Gly substitution) in this region, within a gene encoding an exonuclease, associates with parasite recrudescence following dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine treatment. Genome-wide analysis of CNVs revealed that a single copy of the mdr1 gene on chromosome 5 and a novel amplification of the plasmepsin 2 and plasmepsin 3 genes on chromosome 14 also associate with raised piperaquine IC<sub>50</sub>s. After adjusting for covariates, both exo-E415G and plasmepsin 2-3 markers significantly associate (p=3\u00b70\u2008\u00d7\u200810-8 and p=1\u00b77\u2008\u00d7\u200810-7, respectively) with decreased treatment efficacy (survival rates 0\u00b738 [95% CI 0\u00b725-0\u00b751] and 0\u00b741 [0\u00b728-0\u00b753], respectively).\nINTERPRETATION: The exo-E415G SNP and plasmepsin 2-3 amplification are markers of piperaquine resistance and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine failures in Cambodia, and can help monitor the spread of these phenotypes into other countries of the Greater Mekong subregion, and elucidate the mechanism of piperaquine resistance. Since plasmepsins are involved in the parasite's haemoglobin-to-haemozoin conversion pathway, targeted by related antimalarials, plasmepsin 2-3 amplification probably mediates piperaquine resistance.\nFUNDING: Intramural Research Program of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Wellcome Trust, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Medical Research Council, and UK Department for International Development.",

On admission, he was noted to have anemia of unclear etiology and subsequently became febrile with multiple blood cultures growing Lactococcus garvieae. Inpatient workup was concerning for infectious endocarditis (IE) secondary to Lactococcus. The patient was discharged home with appropriate antimicrobial therapy; however, he was readmitted for persistent, symptomatic anemia and underwent colonoscopy, which revealed innumerable colonic polyps consistent with Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) that was later confirmed with genetic testing. Surveillance computed tomography (CT) imaging of the aortic repair later demonstrated valve dehiscence with surrounding fluid collection; he underwent redo surgery and was found to have destruction of the aortic annulus and a large pseudoaneurysm. Histopathology of the valve prosthesis confirmed IE. It is suspected that the patient developed Lactococcus IE from enteric translocation.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Huntington disease (HD) is a genetic neurodegenerative disease leading to progressive motor, cognitive, and behavioral decline. Subtle changes in these domains are detectable up to 15 years before a definitive motor diagnosis is made. This period, called prodromal HD, provides an opportunity to examine lifestyle behaviors that may impact disease progression.\nTHEORETICAL FRAMEWORK: Physical activity relates to decreased rates of brain atrophy and improved cognitive and day-to-day functioning in Alzheimer disease and healthy aging populations. Previous research has yielded mixed results regarding the impact of physical activity on disease progression in HD and paid little attention to the prodromal phase.\nMETHODS: We conducted analyses of associations among current physical activity level, current and retrospective rate of change for hippocampus and striatum volume, and cognitive, motor, and day-to-day functioning variables. Participants were 48 gene-expanded cases with prodromal and early-diagnosed HD and 27 nongene-expanded control participants. Participants wore Fitbit Ultra activity monitors for three days and completed the self-reported International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). Hippocampal and striatal white matter volumes were measured using magnetic resonance imaging. Cognitive tests included the Stroop Color and Word Test, and the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT). Motor function was assessed using the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale total motor score (TMS). Day-to-day functioning was measured using the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS) version 2.0.\nRESULTS: Higher Fitbit activity scores were significantly related to better scores on the SDMT and WHODAS in case participants but not in controls. Fitbit activity scores tracked better with TMS scores in the group as a whole, though the association did not reach statistical significance in the case participants. Higher Fitbit activity scores related to less day-to-day functioning decline in retrospective slope analyses. Fitbit activity scores did not differ significantly between cases and controls.\nCONCLUSIONS: This is the first known study examining the associations between activity level and imaging, motor, cognitive, and day-to-day functioning outcomes in prodromal and early HD. Preliminary results suggest physical activity positively correlates with improved cognitive and day-to-day functioning and possibly motor function in individuals in the prodromal and early phase of the condition.",

This strategy aims to obtain the gain-of-function of rubber tree genes through overexpressing transformation ready full-length cDNA libraries in Arabidopsis. An initial transformation test produced about two thousand independent transgenic Arabidopsis lines, in which multiple obvious aberrant phenotypes were observed, suggesting the gain-of-function of rubber tree genes. The transferred genes were further isolated and identified.

Genomic DNA isolated from peripheral blood was directly sequenced for variations in the CNGA3 and CNGB3 genes.\nRESULTS: Ophthalmoscopic examination revealed no distinct abnormalities. Electroretinography obtained under anesthesia at age three years revealed absent photopic responses. The dark-adapted combined responses had reduced b-wave amplitudes resulting in an electronegative configuration. Genetic testing revealed two heterozygous sequence variations present in the coding sequence of the CNGA3 gene (Arg223Trp and Pro372Ser), which have been previously described in the setting of achromatopsia. Sequencing of the patient's parents confirmed that these two variations lie on separate alleles.\nCONCLUSION: Novel electroretinography findings in a patient with genetically confirmed achromatopsia are reported.

These methods are relatively invasive, costly, and often have high screening failure rates. Consequently, research is aiming to elucidate blood biomarkers of A\u03b2 and tau.\nOBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate a case/control polygenic risk score (PGRS) as a marker of tau and investigate blood markers of a combined A\u03b2 and tau outcome for the first time. A sub-study also considers plasma tau as markers of A\u03b2 and tau pathology in CSF.\nMETHODS: We used data from the EDAR*, DESCRIPA**, and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohorts in a logistic regression analysis to investigate blood markers of A\u03b2 and tau in CSF. In particular, we investigated the extent to which a case/control PGRS is predictive of CSF tau, CSF amyloid, and a combined amyloid and tau outcome. The predictive ability of models was compared to that of age, gender, and APOE genotype ('basic model').\nRESULTS: In EDAR and DESCRIPA test data, inclusion of a case/control PGRS was no more predictive of A\u03b2, and a combined A\u03b2 and tau endpoint than the basic models (accuracies of 66.0%, and 73.3% respectively). The tau model saw a small increase in accuracy compared to basic models (59.6%). ADNI 2 test data also showed a slight increase in accuracy for the A\u03b2 model when compared to the basic models (61.4%).\nCONCLUSION: We see some evidence that a case/control PGRS is marginally more predictive of A\u03b2 and tau pathology than the basic models. The search for predictive factors of A\u03b2 and tau pathologies, above and beyond demographic information, is still ongoing. Better understanding of AD risk alleles, development of more sensitive assays, and studies of larger sample size are three avenues that may provide such factors. However, the clinical utility of possible predictors of brain A\u03b2 and tau pathologies must also be investigated.*'Beta amyloid oligomers in the early diagnosis of AD and as marker for treatment response'**'Development of screening guidelines and criteria for pre-dementia Alzheimer's disease'.",

        "abstract": "Genetic testing of PKD1 and PKD2 is expected to play an increasingly important role in determining allelic influences in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) in the near future. However, to date, genetic testing is not commonly employed because it is expensive, complicated because of genetic heterogeneity, and does not easily identify pathogenic variants. In this study, we developed a genetic testing system based on next-generation sequencing (NGS), long-range polymerase chain reaction, and a new software package. The new software package integrated seven databases and provided access to five cloud-based computing systems. The database integrated 241 polymorphic nonpathogenic variants detected in 140 healthy Japanese volunteers aged >35 years, who were confirmed by ultrasonography as having no cysts in either kidney. Using this system, we identified 60 novel and 30 known pathogenic mutations in 101 Japanese patients with ADPKD, with an overall detection rate of 89.1% (90/101) [95% confidence interval (CI), 83.0%-95.2%]. The sensitivity of the system increased to 93.1% (94/101) (95% CI, 88.1%-98.0%) when combined with multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification analysis, making it sufficient for use in a clinical setting. In 82 (87.2%) of the patients, pathogenic mutations were detected in PKD1 (95% CI, 79.0%-92.5%), whereas in 12 (12.8%) patients pathogenic mutations were detected in PKD2 (95% CI, 7.5%-21.0%); this is consistent with previously reported findings. In addition, we were able to reconfirm our pathogenic mutation identification results using Sanger sequencing. In conclusion, we developed a high-sensitivity NGS-based system and successfully employed it to identify pathogenic mutations in PKD1 and PKD2 in Japanese patients with ADPKD.",

        "title": "Use of Pharmacogenetic Information in the Treatment of Cardiovascular Disease.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In 1964, Robert A. O'Reilly's research group identified members of a family who required remarkably high warfarin doses (up to 145 mg/day, 20 times the average dose) to achieve appropriate anticoagulation. Since this time, pharmacogenetics has become a mainstay of cardiovascular science, and genetic variants have been implicated in several fundamental classes of medications used in cardiovascular medicine.\nCONTENT: In this review, we discuss genetic variants that affect drug response to 3 classes of cardiovascular drugs: statins, platelet P2Y12 inhibitors, and anticoagulants. These genetic variations have pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic effects and have been shown to explain differences in drug response such as lipid lowering, prevention of cardiovascular disease, and prevention of stroke, as well as incidence of adverse events such as musculoskeletal side effects and bleeding. Several groups have begun to implement pharmacogenetics testing as part of routine clinical care with the goal of improving health outcomes. Such strategies identify both patients at increased risk of adverse outcomes and alternative strategies to mitigate this risk as well as patients with \"normal\" genotypes, who, armed with this information, may have increased confidence and adherence to prescribed medications. While much is known about the genetic variants that underlie these effects, translation of this knowledge into clinical practice has been hampered by difficulty in implementing cost-effective, point-of-care tools to improve physician decision-making as well as a lack of data, as of yet, demonstrating the efficacy of using genetic information to improve health.\nSUMMARY: Many genetic variants that affect individual responses to drugs used in cardiovascular disease prevention and treatment have been described. Further study of these variants is needed before successful implementation into clinical practice.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To describe the populational distribution of the UGT1A1*28 variant (genetic variant code rs8175347) located in the promotor of the UGT gene and correlate its genotypes with the results of the fasting test, as well as its relationship with the biochemical disorder of Gilbert's syndrome (GS) in a Valencian population.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied the prevalence of the genotypes (TA)<sub>6/6</sub> (TA)<sub>6/7</sub> and (TA)<sub>7/7</sub> of the deleterious variant rs8175347 in 144 patients with hyperbilirubinemia, 38 of whom had previously undergone the fasting test to diagnose GS, and in 150 control patients. By analysing the genomic region of the TATA box of the UGT1A1 gene promotor using Sanger sequencing, we established the correlation between the rs8175347 genotypes and the fasting test results and with the patients' biochemical disorders.\nRESULTS: The rate of heterozygosity of allele (TA)<sub>7</sub> in the control population was 32% and increased to 87.59% among the patients with suspected GS. The rate of genotype TA<sub>7/7</sub> was 81.94% among the patients with hyperbilirubinemia, compared with 11.33% in the control patients. The fasting test showed a 15.79% rate of false negatives and a 5.26% rate of false positives.\nCONCLUSIONS: The high frequency of allele (TA)<sub>7</sub> among the Valencian control population, almost double the 5% reported for European control patients, confirms the high rate of GS reported in the Spanish population, without observing significant differences between the geographical ends of the country. The efficacy and reliability of the fasting test for the diagnosis of GS is questionable.",

This study aimed to examine the familial aggregation and heritability of schizophrenia, and the relative risks (RRs) of other psychiatric diseases, in relatives of people with schizophrenia using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Database. The study population included individuals with affected first-degree or second-degree relatives identified from all beneficiaries (n = 23 422 955) registered in 2013. Diagnoses of schizophrenia made by psychiatrists were ascertained between January 1, 1996 and December 31, 2013. Having an affected co-twin, first-degree relative, second-degree relative, or spouse was associated with an adjusted RR (95% CI) of 37.86 (30.55-46.92), 6.30 (6.09-6.53), 2.44 (1.91-3.12), and 1.88 (1.64-2.15), respectively. Compared with the general population, individuals with one affected first-degree relative had a RR (95% CI) of 6.00 (5.79-6.22) and those with 2 or more had a RR (95% CI) of 14.66 (13.00-16.53) for schizophrenia. The accountability for the phenotypic variance of schizophrenia was 47.3% for genetic factors, 15.5% for shared environmental factors, and 37.2% for non-shared environmental factors. The RR (95% CI) in individuals with a first-degree relative with schizophrenia was 3.49 (3.34-3.64) for mood disorders and 3.91 (3.35-4.57) for delusional disorders. A family history of schizophrenia is therefore associated with a higher risk of developing schizophrenia, mood disorders, and delusional disorders. Heritability and environmental factors each account for half of the phenotypic variance of schizophrenia.",

These findings have increased our understanding of disease mechanisms, provided us with new diagnostic tools, and may allow for development of improved therapies for glaucoma. However, genetic testing is most useful when it is reserved for appropriate patients. The purpose of this article is to review key points and recent developments regarding the genetics and genetic testing for glaucoma and to provide recommendations for when genetic testing may be warranted.\nRECENT FINDINGS: Large genome-wide association studies have identified multiple new susceptibility loci associated with primary open angle glaucoma and primary angle closure glaucoma.\nSUMMARY: Several glaucoma-causing genes and genetic risk factors for glaucoma have been discovered. As a result, there are specific clinical scenarios in which genetic testing is warranted. In select cases (i.e., familial juvenile open angle glaucoma), genetic testing can serve as a powerful tool to improve diagnostic accuracy, efficiency of disease surveillance, and selection of treatment, enabling physicians to better optimize care for their patients.",

        "abstract": "DNA methylation can mimic the effects of both germline and somatic mutations for cancer predisposition genes such as BRCA1 and p16INK4a. Constitutional DNA methylation of the BRCA1 promoter has been well described and is associated with an increased risk of early-onset breast cancers that have BRCA1-mutation associated histological features. The role of methylation in the context of other breast cancer predisposition genes has been less well studied and often with conflicting or ambiguous outcomes. We examined the role of methylation in known breast cancer susceptibility genes in breast cancer predisposition and tumor development. We applied the Infinium HumanMethylation450 Beadchip (HM450K) array to blood and tumor-derived DNA from 43 women diagnosed with breast cancer before the age of 40 years and measured the methylation profiles across promoter regions of BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, PALB2, CDH1, TP53, FANCM, CHEK2, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2. Prior genetic testing had demonstrated that these women did not carry a germline mutation in BRCA1, ATM, CHEK2, PALB2, TP53, BRCA2, CDH1 or FANCM. In addition to the BRCA1 promoter region, this work identified regions with variable methylation at multiple breast cancer susceptibility genes including PALB2 and MLH1. Methylation at the region of MLH1 in these breast cancers was not associated with microsatellite instability. This work informs future studies of the role of methylation in breast cancer susceptibility gene silencing.",

        "abstract": "Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is a key enzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway that ensures sufficient production of coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) by catalyzing the reduction of NADP+ to NADPH. Noteworthy, the latter mediates the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by phagocytic cells such as neutrophils and monocytes. Therefore, patients with severe forms of G6PD deficiency may present impaired NADPH oxidase activity and become susceptible to recurrent infections. This fact, highlights the importance to characterize the immunopathologic mechanisms underlying the susceptibility to infections in patients with G6PD deficiency. Here we report the first two cases of G6PD deficiency with Bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) adverse effect, besides jaundice, hemolytic anemia and recurrent infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus. The qualitative G6PD screening was performed and followed by oxidative burst analysis using flow cytometry. Genetic and in silico analyses were carried out by Sanger sequencing and mutation pathogenicity predicted using bioinformatics tools, respectively. Activated neutrophils and monocytes from patients displayed impaired oxidative burst. The genetic analysis revealed the novel missense mutation c.1157T>A/p.L386Q in G6PD. In addition, in silico analysis indicated that this mutation is pathogenic, thereby hampering the oxidative burst of neutrophils and monocytes from patients. Our data expand the clinical and genetic spectrum of G6PD deficiency, and suggest that impaired oxidative burst in this severe primary immune deficiency is an underlying immunopathologic mechanism that predisposes to mycobacterial infections.",

        "abstract": "Technical progress in immunohistochemistry (IHC) as well as the increased utility of IHC for biomarker testing in precision medicine avails us of the opportunity to reassess clinical IHC as a laboratory test and its proper characterization as a special type of immunoassay. IHC, as used in current clinical applications, is a descriptive, qualitative, cell-based, usually nonlinear, in situ protein immunoassay, for which the readout of the results is principally performed by pathologists rather than by the instruments on which the immunoassay is performed. This modus operandi is in contrast to other assays where the instrument also performs the readout of the test result (eg, nephelometry readers, mass spectrometry readers, etc.). The readouts (results) of IHC tests are used either by pathologists for diagnostic purposes or by treating physicians (eg, oncologists) for patient management decisions, the need for further testing, or follow-up. This paper highlights the distinction between the original purpose for which an IHC test is developed and its subsequent clinical uses, as well as the role of pathologists in the analytical and postanalytical phases of IHC testing.

        "abstract": "Microbial capacities drive waste stabilization and resource recovery in environmental friendly processes. Depending on the composition of waste, a stress-mediated selection process ensures a scenario that generates a specific enrichment of microbial community. These communities dynamically change over a period of time while keeping the performance through the required utilization capacities. Depending on the environmental conditions, these communities select the appropriate partners so as to maintain the desired functional capacities. However, the complexities of these organizations are difficult to study. Individual member ratios and sharing of genetic intelligence collectively decide the enrichment and survival of these communities. The next-generation sequencing options with the depth of structure and function analysis have emerged as a tool that could provide the finer details of the underlying bioprocesses associated and shared in environmental niches. These tools can help in identification of the key biochemical events and monitoring of expression of associated phenotypes that will support the operation and maintenance of waste management systems. In this chapter, we link genomic tools with process optimization and/or management, which could be applied for decision making and/or upscaling. This review describes both, the aerobic and anaerobic, options of waste utilization process with the microbial community functioning as flocs, granules, or biofilms. There are a number of challenges involved in harnessing the microbial community intelligence with associated functional plasticity for efficient extension of microbial capacities for resource recycling and waste management.

We therefore decided to resolve the issue by analyzing familial risks when family members were diagnosed with any discordant cancers. We compared the population impact of concordant to discordant familial cancer. The Swedish Family-Cancer Database (FCD) was used to calculate familial relative risks (RRs) for family members of cancer patients, for the 27 most common cancers. Population attributable fractions (PAFs) were estimated for concordant and discordant family histories. Discordant cancers in the family were detected as significant risk factors for the majority of cancers, although the corresponding RRs were modest compared to RRs for concordant cancers. Risks increased with the number of affected family members with the highest RRs for pancreatic (2.31), lung (1.69), kidney (1.98), nervous system (1.79) and thyroid cancers (3.28), when 5 or more family members were diagnosed with discordant cancers. For most cancers, the PAF for discordant family history exceeded that for concordant family history. Our findings suggest that there is an unspecific genetic predisposition to cancer with clinical consequences. We consider it unlikely that shared environmental risk factors could essentially contribute to the risks for diverse discordant cancers, which are likely driven by genetic predisposition. The identification of genes that moderately increase the risk for many cancers will be a challenge.",

Furthermore, the lack of disease awareness and diagnosis facilities have mislead the identification of cystic fibrosis for decades. The knowledge about cystic fibrosis (CF) in Egypt is very limited, and a few reports have drawn attention to the existence of CF or CFTR-related disorders (CFTR-RDs) in the Egyptian population. Therefore a comprehensive genetic analysis of the CFTR gene was realized in patients of North Egypt. DNA samples of 56 Egyptian patients were screened for the CFTR gene mutations. The 27 exons and their flanking regions of the CFTR gene were amplified by PCR, using the published primer pairs, and were studied by automated direct DNA sequencing to detect disease-causing mutations. Moreover, large duplication/deletion was analysed by MLPA technique. CFTR screening revealed the identification of thirteen mutations including four novel ones: c.92G&gt;A (p.Arg31His), c.2782G&gt;C (p.Ala928Pro), c.3718-24G&gt;A, c.4207A&gt;G (p.Arg1403Gly) and nine previously reported mutations: c.454A&gt;T (p.Met152Leu), c.902A&gt;G (p.Tyr301Cys), c.1418delG, c.2620-15C&gt;G, c.2997_3000delAATT, c.3154T&gt;G (p.Phe1052Val), c.3872A&gt;G (p.Gln1291Arg), c.3877G&gt;A (p.Val1293Ile), c.4242+10T&gt;C. Furthermore, eight polymorphisms were found: c.743+40A&gt;G, c.869+11C&gt;T, c.1408A&gt;G, c.1584G&gt;A, c.2562T&gt;G, c.3870A&gt;G, c.4272C&gt;T, c.4389G&gt;A. These mutations and polymorphisms were not previously described in the Egyptian population except for the c.1408A&gt;G polymorphism. Here we demonstrate the importance of the newly discovered mutations in Egyptian patients and the presence of CF, whereas the p.Phe508del mutation is not detected. The identification of CFTR mutations will become increasingly important in undocumented populations. The current findings will help us expand the mutational spectrum of CF and establish the first panel of the CFTR gene mutations in the Egyptian population and design an appropriate strategy for future genetic diagnosis of CF.",

We aimed to investigate the clinical utilities in Japanese and to unveil the function of the 4q25 locus in affecting transcription of adjacent genes.\nMETHODS: We conducted AF GWAS in Japanese population (1382 AF cases and 1478 controls) and the replication panel (1666 AF cases and 1229 controls) with detailed clinical information which showed the acceleration of AF onset. Stepwise investigations with linkage disequilibrium analysis, histone code patterns, and reporter assay in the 4q25 locus were performed.\nRESULTS: The AF GWAS confirmed a significant association of rs4611994 and rs1906617 in chromosome 4q25 with AF. In the clinical analysis, AF onset of the individuals with risk allele accelerated 2.5 years compared with those with protective allele (p=0.00012).

We analyzed 35 melanoma and 33 colorectal cancer specimens. Frequent G12D/V/A/C/S mutations were detected in KRAS. The most frequent BRAF mutation in melanoma was V600E, the percentage of rare mutations is significant for DNA diagnosis (24%). Identification of rare BRAF mutations 1790C\u2192G (L597R), 1798_1799delinsAA (V600K), 1798_1799delinsAG (V600R), and 1799_1800delinsAA (V600E) and NRAS mutation 38G\u2192T (G13V) was possible only by Sanger sequencing. The combination of real-time PCR and sequencing can improve analysis sensitivity and ensure concordance of the tested loci with the international recommendations.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Postzygotic activating mutations of PIK3CA cause a wide range of mosaic disorders collectively referred to as PIK3CA-related overgrowth spectrum (PROS). We describe the diagnostic yield and characteristics of PIK3CA sequencing in PROS.\nMETHODS: We performed ultradeep next-generation sequencing (NGS) of PIK3CA in various tissues from 162 patients referred to our clinical laboratory and assessed diagnostic yield by phenotype and tissue tested.\nRESULTS: We identified disease-causing mutations in 66.7% (108/162) of patients, with mutant allele levels as low as 1%. The diagnostic rate was higher (74%) in syndromic than in isolated cases (35.5%; P = 9.03\u2009\u00d7\u200910-5). We identified 40 different mutations and found strong oncogenic mutations more frequently in patients without brain overgrowth (50.6%) than in those with brain overgrowth (15.2%; P = 0.00055). Mutant allele levels were higher in skin and overgrown tissues than in blood and buccal samples (P = 3.9\u2009\u00d7\u200910-25), regardless of the phenotype.\nCONCLUSION: Our data demonstrate the value of ultradeep NGS for molecular diagnosis of PROS, highlight its substantial allelic heterogeneity, and confirm that optimal diagnosis requires fresh skin or surgical samples from affected regions. Our findings may be of value in guiding future recommendations for genetic testing in PROS and other mosaic conditions.Genet Med advance online publication 02 February 2017.",

This article aimed to estimate the costs, in United States (US) dollars, of a stepped care model for online prevention and treatment among US college students to inform meaningful decisions regarding resource allocation and adoption of efficient care delivery models for EDs on college campuses.\nMETHODS: Using a payer perspective, we estimated the costs of (1) delivering an online guided self-help (GSH) intervention to individuals with EDs, including the costs of \"stepping up\" the proportion expected to \"fail\"; (2) delivering an online preventive intervention compared to a \"wait and treat\" approach to individuals at ED risk; and (3) applying the stepped care model across a population of 1,000 students, compared to standard care.\nRESULTS: Combining results for online GSH and preventive interventions, we estimated a stepped care model would cost less and result in fewer individuals needing in-person psychotherapy (after receiving less-intensive intervention) compared to standard care, assuming everyone in need received intervention.\nCONCLUSIONS: A stepped care model was estimated to achieve modest cost savings compared to standard care, but these estimates need to be tested with sensitivity analyses. Model assumptions highlight the complexities of cost calculations to inform resource allocation, and considerations for a disseminable delivery model are presented. Efforts are needed to systematically measure the costs and benefits of a stepped care model for EDs on college campuses, improve the precision and efficacy of ED interventions, and apply these calculations to non-US care systems with different cost structures.",

We assessed whether positive clinical signs and genetic FH diagnosis affected CAD risk among subjects with significantly elevated LDL cholesterol levels (\u2265180\u2009mg/dL, or\u2009\u2265140\u2009mg/dL in subjects\u2009<15 years of age).\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Three genes causative for FH (LDLR, APOB, and PCSK9) were sequenced in 636 patients with severe hypercholesterolaemia (mean age, 45 years; 300 males [47%], CAD diagnosis, 185 [29%]), and the presence of clinical FH signs (xanthoma and/or family history) were assessed. CAD prevalence was compared between four subject groups categorized based on these parameters. Compared with the reference group without FH mutations or clinical signs of FH, subjects with clinical signs of FH or FH mutations had three- to four-fold higher odds of developing CAD (odds ratio [OR], 4.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.5-14.5; P\u2009=\u20090.0011 and OR, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.0-10.9; P\u2009=\u20090.0047, respectively), whereas those with clinical signs of FH and FH mutation(s) had >11-fold higher odds of developing CAD (OR, 11.6; 95% CI, 4.4-30.2; P\u2009=\u20091.1\u2009\u00d7\u200910-5) after adjusting for known risk factors including LDL cholesterol.\nCONCLUSION: Our findings revealed an additive effect of positive clinical signs of FH and positive FH mutation status to CAD risk among patients with significantly elevated LDL cholesterol.",

        "abstract": "Studies of physical activity behaviours have increasingly shown the importance of heritable factors such as genetic variation. Nonsynonymous polymorphisms of alpha-actinin 3 (ACTN3) and the \u03b2-adrenergic receptors 1 and 3 (ADRB1 and ADRB3) have been previously associated with exercise capacity and cardiometabolic health. We thus hypothesized that these polymorphisms are also related to physical activity behaviours in young adults. To test this hypothesis we examined relationships between ACTN3 (R577X), ARDB1 (Arg389Gly), ADRB3 (Trp64Arg), and physical activity behaviours in university students. We stratified for student enrollment in kinesiology degree programs compared with nonmajors as we previously found this to be a predictor of physical activity. We did not identify novel associations between physical activity and ACTN3. However, the minor alleles of ADRB1 and ADRB3 were significantly underrepresented in kinesiology students compared with nonmajors. Furthermore, carriers of the ADRB1 minor allele reported reduced participation in moderate physical activity and increased afternoon fatigue compared with ancestral allele homozygotes. Together, these findings suggest that the heritability of physical activity behaviours in young adults may be linked to nonsynonymous polymorphisms within \u03b2-adrenergic receptors.",

So far, it has been associated with mutations only in the Aurora Kinase C gene (AURKC) in some cases. Although many publications have reported failure to conceive in couples with macrozoospermia, a few others have described successful pregnancies, thus raising questions as to whether ICSI and AURKC genetic screening should be recommended in all patients with macrozoospermia. First, we report on two monozygotic twins presenting macrozoospermia for whom the genetic status was explored (Aurora Kinase C sequencing) and whole semen and gradient-selected spermatozoa were analyzed, using Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization (FISH), Electron Microscopy and flow cytometry. Additionally, FISH analysis was performed on individually selected uniflagellate spermatozoa with normal sized heads. Second, we also provide an updated review of patients with macrozoospermia gathering the percentage of enlarged head spermatozoa, the genetic status and pregnancy outcomes. Both twins carried a homozygous mutation of AURKC. Spermocytograms showed means of 86% and 83.5% of enlarged head forms. FISH analyses showed that normal head size, uniflagellate spermatozoa had an aneuploid or polyploid nucleus despite a high level of selection. SEM analysis also showed special intranuclear inclusions in enlarged head spermatozoa. Our data together with cases reported in the literature allowed us to recommend that the AURKC gene should be sequenced when the sperm contains 30% or more of enlarged head spermatozoa, and when a mutation is found, ART should not be performed. Our analyses provide information that could greatly help practitioners in their decision-making with regard to optimal care of patients with macrozoospermia.",

A comprehensive WGS pipeline was used to ensure reliable detection of genomic variants. Beyond variant filtering, we pursued phenotypic prioritization of candidate genes using Phenolyzer.\nRESULTS: Regarding PWS, WGS confirmed a 5.5\u00a0Mb de novo deletion of the parental allele at 15q11.2 to 15q13.1. Phenolyzer successfully returned the diagnosis of PWS, and pinpointed clinically relevant genes in the deletion. Further, Phenolyzer revealed how each of the genes is linked with the phenotypes represented by HPO terms. For HH, WGS identified a known disease variant (p.C282Y) in HFE of an affected female. Analysis of HPO terms alone fails to provide a correct diagnosis, but Phenolyzer successfully revealed the phenotype-genotype relationship using a disease-centric approach. Finally, Phenolyzer also revealed the complexity behind dysautonomia-like symptoms, and seven variants that might be associated with the phenotypes were identified by manual filtering based on a dominant inheritance model.\nCONCLUSIONS: The integration of WGS and HPO can inform comprehensive molecular diagnosis for patients, eliminate false positives and reveal novel insights into undiagnosed diseases. Due to extreme heterogeneity and insufficient knowledge of human diseases, it is also important that phenotypic and genomic data are standardized and shared simultaneously.",

        "abstract": "Current genotyping methodologies for transplantation and transfusion management employ multiplex systems that allow for simultaneous detection of multiple HLA antigens, human platelet antigens, and red blood cell (RBC) antigens. The development of high-resolution, molecular HLA typing has led to improved outcomes in unrelated hematopoietic stem cell transplants by better identifying compatible alleles of the HLA-A, B, C, DRB1, and DQB1 antigens. In solid organ transplantation, the combination of high-resolution HLA typing with solid-phase antibody identification has proven of value for highly sensitized patients and has significantly reduced incompatible crossmatches at the time of organ allocation. This database-driven, combined HLA antigen/antibody testing has enabled routine implementation of \"virtual crossmatching\" and may even obviate the need for physical crossmatching. In addition, DNA-based testing for RBC antigens provides an alternative typing method that mitigates many of the limitations of hemagglutination-based phenotyping. Although RBC genotyping has utility in various transfusion settings, it has arguably been most useful for minimizing alloimmunization in the management of transfusion-dependent patients with sickle cell disease or thalassemia. The availability of high-throughput RBC genotyping for both individuals and large populations of donors, along with coordinated informatics systems to compare patients' antigen profiles with available antigen-negative and/or rare blood-typed donors, holds promise for improving the efficiency, reliability, and extent of RBC matching for this population.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The advances in genomic technology of large populations make the potential for genomic screening of military cohorts and recruits feasible, affording the potential to identify at-risk individuals before occurrence of potentially life-threatening events. Exploring sudden cardiac death, known to cause significant morbidity and mortality in young military service members, we focused on the most common gene associated with long QT syndrome (LQTS), KCNQ1.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Using the publicly available database Exome Aggregation Consortium as a surrogate for a military population, variants in KCNQ1 were filtered on the basis of population prevalence, classification as a disease mutation in the Human Gene Mutation database, and classification as pathogenic or likely pathogenic in the ClinVar database. Variant prevalence and penetrance estimates were derived using reports from the medical literature.\nRESULTS: We showed that in a population of over 60,000 individuals, at least 97 (0.2%) individuals would harbor a potentially pathogenic mutation in KCNQ1, which is more prevalent than expected on the basis of current medical literature (p = 0.0004). KCNQ1 variant penetrance was estimated to be only 9% to 17%. Identifying the importance of large genomic studies, our study demonstrates that 46% of pathogenic mutations in KCNQ1 had a population frequency of less than 1:50,000.\nCONCLUSION: Screening a large database with genomic screening for a condition that is relevant to active duty service members results in the identification of many individuals with potentially pathogenic mutations in the KCNQ1 gene, which has profound implications for screening military or other adult cohorts in terms of over diagnosis, overtreatment, and increased medical resource usage. This study of KCNQ1 provides a platform for consideration of other genes that cause sudden cardiac death as well as other medically actionable hereditary disorders for which genomic screening is available. We review the potential benefits of genomic screening and also present the complex hurdles that will be encountered as such technologies unfold.",

The purpose here was to provide a better understanding of the factors related to problematic smartphone use (PSPU). Methods The participants were 100 undergraduates (25 males, 75 females) whose ages ranged from 18 to 23 (mean age\u2009=\u200920 years). The participants completed questionnaires to assess gender, ethnicity, year in college, father's education level, mother's education level, family income, age, family history of alcoholism, and PSPU. The Family Tree Questionnaire assessed family history of alcoholism. The Mobile Phone Problem Use Scale (MPPUS) and the Adapted Cell Phone Addiction Test (ACPAT) were used to determine the degree of PSPU. Whereas the MPPUS measures tolerance, escape from other problems, withdrawal, craving, and negative life consequences, the ACPAT measures preoccupation (salience), excessive use, neglecting work, anticipation, lack of control, and neglecting social life. Results Family history of alcoholism and father's education level together explained 26% of the variance in the MPPUS scores and 25% of the variance in the ACPAT scores. The inclusion of mother's education level, ethnicity, family income, age, year in college, and gender did not significantly increase the proportion of variance explained for either MPPUS or ACPAT scores. Discussion and conclusions Family history of alcoholism and father's education level are good predictors of PSPU. As 74%-75% of the variance in PSPU scale scores was not explained, future studies should aim to explain this variance.",

However, few results have been replicated independently, largely due to cohort differences in ancestry, chemotherapy treatment protocols, and definitions of toxicities. To date, there is only one widely accepted clinical guideline for dose modification based on gene status: thiopurine dosing based on TPMT genotype. Based on recent data, it is likely that this guideline will be modified to incorporate other gene variants, such as NUDT15. We highlight genetic variants that have been consistently associated with TRT across treatment groups, as well as those that best illustrate the underlying pathophysiology of TRT. In the coming decade, we expect that survivorship care will routinely specify screening recommendations based on genetics.
